10076535	CHEMICALIN antagonistic effect of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) metabolites on wild-type and mutated GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is used frequently, alone or in combination with other antitumor agents, for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. CHEMICALNOTIN is metabolically activated in vivo, and its metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibit the assembly of microtubules [for review see: Kreis W, In: Concepts, Mechanisms, and New Targets for Chemotherapy (Ed. Muggia FM), pp. 163-184. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1995]. We investigated, by displacement of CHEMICALNOTIN in the presence of 2.5 mM of CHEMICALNOTIN, the binding of CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, as well as other antiandrogen agents including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, to the mutated GENENOTIN (m-GENENOTIN) in LNCaP cells and to the wild-type GENENOTIN in wild-type GENENOTIN cDNA expression plasmid (w-pAR0) cDNA-transfected HeLa cells. Analogous to the antiandrogens, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, binding of CHEMICALIN metabolites to the GENEIN was observed. The EC50 values (in microM) were: CHEMICALNOTIN, > 10; CHEMICALNOTIN, 3.129 +/- 0.312; CHEMICALNOTIN; 2.612 +/- 0.584; CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.800 +/- 0.090; CHEMICALNOTIN, 1.051 +/- 0.096; CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.523 +/- 0.028; CHEMICALNOTIN, 4.920 +/- 0.361; and CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.254 +/- 0.012. The transactivation assay demonstrated that, analogous to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN could not induce luciferase activity in either w-pAR0 or m-pARL transfected HeLa cells. In contrast, a strong induction of the reporter activity by CHEMICALNOTIN was observed. Down-regulation of GENEIN (GENEIN) expression, an GENEIN-target gene, by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN was accompanied by the blockade of the mutated GENEIN. Exposure of LNCaP cells to CHEMICALIN for 24 hr caused transcriptional inhibition of GENEIN in a concentration-dependent manner. The levels of GENEIN mRNA decreased 56 and 90% when LNCaP cells were treated with 5 and 10 microM of CHEMICALIN, respectively (IC50 = 10.97 +/- 1.68 microM). Binding of CHEMICALIN to m-GENEIN in LNCaP cells resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of GENEIN expression, suggesting that CHEMICALIN acted as an agonist of the m-GENEIN. Our data indicate that CHEMICALIN metabolites perform as CHEMICALIN antagonists of GENEIN, an additional mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with prostate cancer.
10089512	Static Laue diffraction studies on GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is one of nature's fastest enzymes, despite the fact that its three-dimensional structure reveals its active site to be deeply sequestered within the molecule. This raises questions with respect to traffic of substrate to, and products from, the active site, which may be investigated by time-resolved crystallography. In order to address one aspect of the feasibility of performing time-resolved studies on GENENOTIN, a data set has been collected using the Laue technique on a trigonal crystal of GENEIN soaked with the reversible inhibitor CHEMICALIN, using a total X-ray exposure time of 24 ms. Electron-density maps obtained from the Laue data, which are of surprisingly good quality compared with similar maps from monochromatic data, show essentially the same features. They clearly reveal the bound ligand, as well as a structural change in the conformation of the active-site Ser200 induced upon binding.
10201371	Synthesis of thrombin-inhibiting heparin mimetics without side effects. Unwanted side effects of pharmacologically active compounds can usually be eliminated by structural modifications. But the complex heterogeneous structure of the polysaccharide heparin has limited this approach to fragmentation, leading to slightly better-tolerated heparin preparations of low molecular mass. Despite this improvement, heparin-induced thrombocytopaenia (HIT), related to an interaction with platelet factor 4 (PF4) and, to a lesser extent, haemorrhages, remain significant side effects of heparinotherapy. Breakthroughs in oligosaccharide chemistry made possible the total synthesis of the pentasaccharide antithrombin-binding site of heparin. This pentasaccharide represents a new family of potential antithrombotic drugs, devoid of thrombin inhibitory properties, and free of undesired interactions with blood and vessel components. To obtain more potent and well-tolerated antithrombotic drugs, we wished to synthesize heparin mimetics able to inhibit thrombin, that is, longer oligosaccharides. Like thrombin inhibition, undesired interactions are directly correlated to the charge and the size of the molecules, so we had to design structures that were able to discriminate between thrombin and other proteins, particularly PF4. Here we describe the use of multistep converging synthesis to obtain sulphated oligosaccharides that meet these requirements.
10220509	Selective inhibition of GENEIN spares renal function and CHEMICALIN synthesis in cirrhotic rats with ascites. BACKGROUND & AIMS: The critical role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) products in maintenance of renal function in cirrhosis with ascites discourages the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in this disease. The recent development of selective GENENOTIN inhibitors opens new avenues for the use of these compounds in decompensated cirrhosis. The current study evaluates the effects of a selective GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) on renal function in cirrhotic rats with ascites. METHODS: In protocol 1, urine volume, urinary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow were measured before and after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (n = 12) or CHEMICALNOTIN (n = 10) to rats with cirrhosis. Protocol 2 was aimed at assessing the effects of GENENOTIN inhibitors on renal water metabolism in 28 cirrhotic rats. RESULTS: Administration of CHEMICALNOTIN to cirrhotic animals did not produce significant renal effects, whereas administration of the nonselective GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, resulted in a marked reduction in urine volume, urinary excretion of CHEMICALIN, and glomerular filtration rate and in a significant impairment in renal water metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN does not significantly impair renal function in rats with cirrhosis.
10351938	Inhibition of GENEIN translocation and CHEMICALNOTIN secretion by CHEMICALIN in exogenously activated human eosinophils. We examined the effect of the highly lipophilic corticosteroid, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), in causing (1) inhibition of nuclear translocation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and (2) blockade of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) synthesis in isolated human eosinophils in vitro. Eosinophils were isolated from peripheral blood, treated with either buffer or 10(-)10 M to 10(-)6 M CHEMICALIN in the presence of 10 pg/ml GENEIN (GENEIN) and activated with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) + CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). At 24 h, stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN secretion from eosinophils was unchanged; however, when corrected for cell viability, CHEMICALNOTIN secretion decreased from 1,429 +/- 327 pg/10(6) cells to 762 +/- 113 pg/10(6) cells for eosinophils treated for 48 h with >/= 10(-)8 M CHEMICALNOTIN (p < 0.003). CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN-stimulated translocation of GENEIN to the nuclear envelope assessed by specific immunohistochemical staining also was blocked by CHEMICALIN. By contrast, membrane expression of GENEIN, which was not minimal at 30 min, was substantial at 48 h for eosinophils treated with > 10(-)10 M CHEMICALIN, and inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis was reversed by exogenous CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). We find that CHEMICALIN causes a decrease in stimulated eosinophil secretion of CHEMICALIN that is regulated by GENEIN (GENEIN). Inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis precedes the global cytotoxic effects of CHEMICALIN as indicated by the simultaneous upregulation of GENEIN expression. Inhibited stimulated secretion corresponds to inhibited translocation of GENENOTIN to the nuclear envelope during cellular activation.
10424850	CHEMICALIN treatment decreases CHEMICALIN binding and GENEIN mRNA in SK-N-SHSY5Y cells. The antidepressant CHEMICALIN has been shown to decrease synaptic membrane concentrations of the GENEIN (GENEIN) in vivo and in vitro, on both an acute and a chronic basis. The possible contribution of decreased GENENOTIN synthesis to the chronic downregulation of the GENENOTIN has not been definitively established. In this study, we treated SK-N-SHSY5Y cells with 100 nM CHEMICALNOTIN for 24 or 72 h, and measured CHEMICALNOTIN binding (as an estimate of GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN mRNA by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Similar to what has been reported previously, membrane CHEMICALNOTIN binding was significantly decreased at both 24 and 72 h (approximately 50% at both time points). However, a significant decrease (64 +/- 8% of paired control) of GENENOTIN mRNA was observed only at the 72-h time point. We conclude that decreased GENENOTIN synthesis may contribute to the chronic, but not acute, effect of CHEMICALIN to downregulate the GENEIN.
10510456	Inhibition of the GENEIN by CHEMICALIN: affinity for open and inactivated states. 1 CHEMICALNOTIN is a prokinetic agent which has been associated with QT prolongation, torsades de pointes and cardiac arrest. The cellular mechanism for these observations is high affinity blockade of GENENOTIN (encoded by GENENOTIN). 2 In a chronic transfection model using CHO-K1 cells, CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN tail currents after a step to +25 mV with similar potency at room and physiological temperatures (IC50 16. 4 nM at 20-22 degrees C and 23.6 nM at 37 degrees C). 3 Channel inhibition exhibited time-, voltage- and frequency-dependence. In an envelope of tails test, channel blockade increased from 27+/-8% after a 120 ms depolarizing step to 50+/-4% after a 1.0 s step. These findings suggested affinity for open and/or inactivated channel states. 4 Inactivation was significantly accelerated by CHEMICALNOTIN in a concentration-dependent manner and there was a small (-7 mV) shift in the voltage dependence of steady state inactivation. 5 Channel blockade by CHEMICALNOTIN was modulated by [CHEMICALNOTIN]o, with a 26% reduction in the potency of channel blockade when [CHEMICALNOTIN]o was increased from 1 to 10 mM. 6 In conclusion, GENEIN channel inhibition by CHEMICALIN exhibits features consistent with open and inactivated state binding and is sensitive to external CHEMICALIN concentration. These features may have significant clinical implications with regard to the mechanism and treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced proarrhythmia.
10516958	Comparison of the novel antipsychotic CHEMICALIN with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN: inhibition of dorsal raphe cell firing and the role of GENEIN activation. CHEMICALIN is a novel antipsychotic agent which binds with high affinity to GENEIN (Ki = 3.4 nM), in addition to GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN sites. While it is an antagonist at these latter receptors, CHEMICALIN behaves as a GENEIN agonist in vitro in GENENOTIN measurements. The goal of the present study was to examine the GENEIN properties of CHEMICALIN in vivo using as a marker of central GENENOTIN activity the inhibition of firing of CHEMICALNOTIN-containing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus. In anesthetized rats, CHEMICALNOTIN dose-dependently slowed raphe unit activity (ED50 = 300 micrograms/kg i.v.) as did the atypical antipsychotics CHEMICALNOTIN (ED50 = 250 micrograms/kg i.v.) and CHEMICALNOTIN (ED50 = 1000 micrograms/kg i.v.). Pretreatment with the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (10 micrograms/kg i.v.) prevented the CHEMICALIN-induced inhibition; the same dose of CHEMICALIN had little effect on the inhibition produced by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Because all three agents also bind to GENENOTIN, antagonists of which inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN neuronal firing, this aspect of their pharmacology was assessed with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a CHEMICALNOTIN re-uptake blocker previously shown to reverse the effects of alpha 1 antagonists on raphe unit activity. CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg/kg i.v.) failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN but produced nearly complete reversal of that of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. These profiles suggest a mechanism of action for each agent, GENEIN agonism for CHEMICALIN and alpha 1 antagonism for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The GENEIN agonist activity reported here clearly distinguishes CHEMICALIN from currently available antipsychotic agents and suggests that this property may play a significant role in its pharmacologic actions.
10548268	Reduction of oral CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration in rats by GENENOTIN inhibitors. Evidence for a role of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in the control of CHEMICALNOTIN intake in animals suggests that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, which increase the synaptic availability of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN by blocking their metabolism, might have efficacy in the treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence. The aim of the present study was, therefore, to evaluate several GENENOTIN inhibitors for their capacity to affect CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration in rats trained to self-administer CHEMICALNOTIN (10% v/v) orally in a free-choice two-lever operant task. The nonselective and irreversible GENEIN inhibitors, CHEMICALIN (3-10 mg/kg), CHEMICALIN (1-3 mg/kg), and CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg), decreased rates of responding maintained by CHEMICALNOTIN reinforcement. The reversible GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN (0.3-3 mg/kg), and the irreversible GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN (10-30 mg/kg), also reduced CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration. However, CHEMICALNOTIN-induced effects leveled off at a 50% decrease. The irreversible GENEIN inhibitors, CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg) and CHEMICALIN (3-10 mg/kg) also decreased responding maintained by CHEMICALNOTIN reinforcement; these results are consistent with previous findings that both drugs decreased CHEMICALNOTIN intake in mice. In conclusion, the present results showing that several GENENOTIN inhibitors decreased CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration in rats are consistent with previous findings that synaptic levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN play a critical role in the control of CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration.
10561120	Decreased intracellular proteolysis correlates with the maintenance of a specific isoenzyme of GENENOTIN. The rates of intracellular protein degradation, of identically labelled populations of proteins, were compared in hepatocytes cultured at 37 degrees (on an adsorbed collagen layer) and in cells preserved on gelatin gels at 10 degrees C. The half-lives of the long-lived proteins were 35.4+/-8.6 h (N=4) and 692.9+/-216.9 h (N=4) respectively. Proteolysis was substantially decreased at 10 degrees C but the rate of decrease remained constant. Hepatocytes rapidly removed CHEMICALNOTIN from the culture medium. The CHEMICALNOTIN was not being conjugated or accumulated within the cells. CHEMICALIN, a potent inhibitor of GENEIN, at high concentration (500 microm ) caused only a 72% decrease in the utilization of CHEMICALNOTIN. The microsomal detoxifying enzyme, GENENOTIN remained at a constant level in the preserved hepatocyte monolayers. The results of this study strongly favour storing hepatocytes at 10 degrees C rather than at 4 degrees or 37 degrees C.
10577279	A novel mutation of the GENEIN gene in a patient with non-inherited CHEMICALIN-responsive sideroblastic anemia. A novel missense mutation, GENEIN, in exon 5 of the GENEIN gene (GENEIN) was identified in a Japanese male with CHEMICALIN-responsive sideroblastic anemia. Activity of the mutant GENEIN protein expressed in vitro was 15.1% compared with the normal control, but was increased up to 34.5% by the addition of CHEMICALIN, consistent with the clinical response of the patient to CHEMICALIN treatment. The same mutation was also detected in genomic DNa from the oral mucosal membrane of the patiet; however, it was not detected in other family member. These findings suggest that this GENENOTIN mutation is responsible for sideroblastic anemia in the proband, and may be an index mutation in this pedigree.
10587286	Preferential cerebrospinal fluid GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN in humans. This study sought to examine the feasibility of prolonged assessment of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of volunteers and to test the hypothesis that CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN, Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) selectively inhibits GENENOTIN in CSF in humans at a dose producing minimal inhibition of the peripheral enzyme. Lumbar CSF samples were collected continuously (0.1 mL x min(-1)) for 49 hours from eight healthy volunteers who took either placebo or a single oral dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (3 mg). CSF specimens and samples of blood cells and blood plasma were analyzed at intervals for CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolite CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), erythrocyte GENENOTIN activity, CSF GENENOTIN activity, and plasma and CSF GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity. Safety evaluations were performed 23 hours after drug dosing and at the end of the study. Evaluable data were obtained from six subjects. The mean time to maximal CHEMICALNOTIN plasma concentration (tmax) was 0.83 +/- 0.26 hours, the mean maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 4.88 +/- 3.82 ng x mL(-1), the mean plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC0-infinity) was 7.43 +/- 4.74 ng x hr x mL(-1), and the mean plasma t1/2 was 0.85 +/- 0.115 hours. The concentration of CHEMICALNOTIN in CSF was lower than the quantification limit for assay (0.65 ng x mL(-1)), but CHEMICALNOTIN reached a mean Cmax of 3.14 +/- 0.57 ng x mL(-1). Only minimal inhibition of erythrocyte GENENOTIN activity (approximately 3%) was observed. Inhibition of GENEIN in the CSF after CHEMICALIN administration was significantly greater than after placebo for up to 8.4 hours after the dose and was maximal (40%) at 2.4 hours. Plasma GENEIN activity was significantly lower after CHEMICALIN than after placebo, but this was not clinically relevant. GENEIN activity in CSF was significantly lower after CHEMICALIN than after placebo for up to 3.6 hours after dosing, but this difference was not sustained. This study confirms the feasibility of using continuous measurement of GENENOTIN activity in CSF over prolonged periods, that CHEMICALIN markedly inhibits CSF GENEIN after a single oral dose of 3 mg, and that the inhibition of central GENEIN is substantially greater than that of peripheral GENEIN or GENEIN.
10593931	Identification of CHEMICALIN in the GENEIN required for activation of GENEIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) proteolytically cleaves its substrate, GENENOTIN, in an interaction requiring the GENENOTIN (Sun, Y., and Gailani, D. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 29023-29028). To identify key CHEMICALIN involved in GENEIN activation, recombinant GENEIN proteins containing CHEMICALIN substitutions for wild-type sequence were expressed in 293 fibroblasts and tested in a plasma clotting assay. Substitutions for Ile(183)-Val(191) and Ser(195)-Ile(197) at the CHEMICALIN terminus and for Ser(258)-Ser(264) at the CHEMICALIN terminus of the GENEIN markedly decreased GENENOTIN coagulant activity. The GENENOTIN GENENOTIN is structurally homologous to GENENOTIN, but activated GENENOTIN poorly. A chimeric GENENOTIN molecule with the GENENOTIN replaced with A3 from GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) GENENOTIN with a K(m) 35-fold greater than that of wild-type GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN was used as a template for a series of proteins in which GENENOTIN A3 sequence was replaced with GENENOTIN sequence to restore GENENOTIN activation. Clotting and kinetics studies using these chimeras confirmed the results obtained with CHEMICALNOTIN mutants. CHEMICALIN between Ile(183) and Val(191) are necessary for proper GENEIN activation, but additional sequence between Ser(195) and Ile(197) or between Phe(260) and Ser(265) is required for complete restoration of activation.
10611634	Agonist and antagonist actions of CHEMICALIN as compared to CHEMICALIN at GENEIN GENEIN, CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and GENENOTIN. Significance for the modulation of frontocortical monoaminergic transmission and depressive states. Herein, we evaluate the interaction of the GENEIN, CHEMICALIN, as compared to CHEMICALIN, at multiple GENEIN and examine their roles in the modulation of adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in freely-moving rats. CHEMICALIN displays marked affinity at GENENOTIN, significant affinity for GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN and weak affinity for GENEIN. In [CHEMICALIN]GTPgammaS binding protocols, CHEMICALIN exerts antagonist actions at GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN sites, yet partial agonist actions at GENEIN sites. In vivo, agonist actions of CHEMICALIN at GENEIN sites are revealed by CHEMICALIN-reversible induction of hypothermia in the rat. In guinea pigs, antagonist actions of CHEMICALIN at GENEIN receptors are revealed by blockade of hypothermia evoked by the GENEIN agonist, CHEMICALIN. In distinction to CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN shows only modest partial agonist actions at GENEIN sites versus marked antagonist actions at GENEIN. While CHEMICALNOTIN selectively enhances hippocampal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) turnover, CHEMICALNOTIN also enhances striatal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) turnover and suppresses striatal turnover of CHEMICALNOTIN. Further, CHEMICALNOTIN decreases firing of serotonergic neurones in raphe nuclei, an action reversed by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN increases extracellular levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, in frontal cortex. In analogy, CHEMICALNOTIN enhances FCX levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, yet suppresses those of CHEMICALNOTIN, the latter effect being antagonized by CHEMICALNOTIN. The induction by fluoxetine of FCX levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN is potentiated by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN likewise facilitates the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN upon CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels, but not those of CHEMICALNOTIN. In conclusion, the GENEIN antagonist properties of CHEMICALIN increase CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels both alone and in association with fluoxetine. However, in contrast to the selective GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, the GENEIN agonist actions of CHEMICALIN suppress CHEMICALNOTIN levels alone and underlie its inability to augment the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN upon CHEMICALNOTIN levels.
10640321	The antitussive activity of GENENOTIN stimulation in guinea pigs. In this study, the activity of the GENEIN subtype-selective agonist, CHEMICALIN, was investigated in a guinea pig model of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cough. Parenteral administration of selective agonists of the GENEIN (CHEMICALIN), GENEIN (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN), and GENEIN (CHEMICALIN) produced dose-related inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cough with ED(50) values of 7.3, 5.2, 5.1, and 5.3 mg/kg, respectively. The nonselective GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (3 mg/kg, i.m.), attenuated the antitussive effects of CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN, indicating that the antitussive activity of both compounds is GENEIN-mediated. The GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (10 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited the antitussive effect of CHEMICALIN (20 mg/kg, i.p.). In contrast, combined pretreatment with CHEMICALIN (GENEIN antagonist; 20 mg/kg, s.c.) and CHEMICALIN (GENEIN antagonist; 20 mg/kg, s.c.), at doses that inhibited the antitussive activity of GENENOTIN agonists, respectively, was without effect on the antitussive response of CHEMICALNOTIN (20 mg/kg, i.p.). The GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (3 mg/kg, i.p.) inhibited the antitussive effect of CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg, i.p.), a sigma-receptor agonist, but not that of CHEMICALNOTIN. These studies provide compelling evidence that the antitussive effects of CHEMICALIN in this guinea pig cough model are mediated by agonist activity at the GENEIN.
10643177	GENENOTIN-specific inhibition: implications for clinical practice. Although conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have long been a major therapeutic choice for the management of arthritic conditions, the potential adverse effects of these agents sometimes compromise their clinical utility. New modes of therapy have recently been introduced, and data on the GENEIN (GENEIN)-specific inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN suggest that these agents will meet the need for safe and effective therapeutic alternatives to conventional NSAIDs.
10658902	Kinetics of inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN derivatives, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Mitochondrially-bound GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyzes the fourth sequential step in the de novo synthesis of CHEMICALIN. The enzyme has been identified as or surmised to be the pharmacological target for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives, which exerted antiproliferative, immunosuppressive, and antiparasitic effects. Despite this broad spectrum of biological and clinical relevance, there have been no comparative studies on drug-GENENOTIN interactions. Here, we describe a study of the inhibition of the purified recombinant GENENOTIN by ten compounds. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and the natural compounds CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN derivative) were found to function as alternative electron acceptors with 10-30% of control enzyme activity. The human and rat enzyme activity was decreased by 50% by the natural compound CHEMICALNOTIN ( > 500 and 49 microM, respectively) and by the derivatives CHEMICALNOTIN (67 and 10 nM), CHEMICALNOTIN (618 and 61 nM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (15 microM and 698 nM). With respect to the CHEMICALIN co-substrate of the GENEIN, CHEMICALIN (Kic = 2.7 microM) and CHEMICALIN (Kic = 9.8 nM) were shown to be competitive inhibitors of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (Kic = 60 nM) was also acompetitive inhibitor of the rat enzyme. CHEMICALIN was found to be a time-dependent inhibitor of the rat enzyme, with the lowest inhibition constant (Ki* = 0.77 nM) determined so far for GENEIN. Another inhibitor, CHEMICALIN was previously reported to be a slow-binding inhibitor of the GENEIN [W. Knecht, M. Loffler, Species-related inhibition of GENEIN by immunosuppressive CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN derivatives, Biochem. Pharmacol. 56 (1998) 1259-1264]. The slow binding features of this potent inhibitor (Ki* = 1.8 nM) with the human enzyme, were verified and seen to be one of the reasons for the narrow therapeutic window (efficacy versus toxicity) reported from clinical trials on its antiproliferative and immunosuppressive action. With respect to the substrate CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN was an uncompetitive inhibitor of GENEIN (Kiu = 11.6 microM) and a non-competitive inhibitor of the rat enzyme (Kiu = 905/ Kic = 1,012 nM). 1.5 mM CHEMICALNOTIN, a natural CHEMICALNOTIN from fungi, influenced the activity of the human enzyme only slightly; the activity of the rat enzyme was decreased by 30%.
10662748	GENENOTIN blockers identify risk for sudden death in patients with ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block but structurally normal hearts. BACKGROUND: A mutation in the GENENOTIN gene (GENENOTIN) has been described in patients with the syndrome of right bundle branch block, ST-segment elevation in leads V1 to V3, and sudden death (Brugada syndrome). These electrocardiographic manifestations are transient in many patients with the syndrome. The present study examined arrhythmic risk in patients with overt and concealed forms of the disease and the effectiveness of GENENOTIN blockers to unmask the syndrome and, thus, identify patients at risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: The effect of intravenous CHEMICALIN (1 mg/kg), CHEMICALIN (10 mg/kg), or CHEMICALIN (2 mg/kg) on the ECG was studied in 34 patients with the syndrome and transient normalization of the ECG (group A), 11 members of 3 families in whom a GENEIN mutation was associated with the syndrome and 8 members in whom it was not (group B), and 53 control subjects (group C). CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN administration resulted in ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block in all patients in group A and in all 11 patients with the mutation in group B. A similar pattern could not be elicited in the 8 patients in group B who lacked the mutation or in any person in group C. The follow-up period (37+/-33 months) revealed no differences in the incidence of arrhythmia between the 34 patients in whom the phenotypic manifestation of the syndrome was transient and the 24 patients in whom it was persistent (log-rank, 0.639). CONCLUSIONS: The data demonstrated a similar incidence of potentially lethal arrhythmias in patients displaying transient versus persistent ST-segment elevation and right bundle branch block, as well as the effectiveness of GENENOTIN blockers to unmask the syndrome and, thus, identify patients at risk.
10665814	Determinants of voltage-dependent inactivation affect CHEMICALIN block of GENEIN. The GENENOTIN family is a major target for a range of therapeutic drugs. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) belongs to a new chemical class of these molecules which differs from other CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists by its ability to potently block GENEIN. However, this molecule has also been shown to inhibit other GENENOTIN subtypes. To further analyze the mechanism governing the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN interaction, we examined the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on various recombinant GENENOTIN expressed in mammalian cells from their cloned cDNAs, using CHEMICALNOTIN as the permeant ion at physiological concentration. Expression of alpha1A, alpha1C, and alpha1E in tsA 201 cells resulted in CHEMICALNOTIN currents with functional characteristics closely related to those of their native counterparts. CHEMICALIN blocked alpha1A and alpha1E with a Kd comparable to that reported for GENEIN, but had a lower affinity (approximately 30-fold) for alpha1C. For each channel, inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN was consistent with high-affinity binding to the inactivated state. Modulation of the voltage-dependent inactivation properties by the nature of the coexpressed beta subunit or the alpha1 splice variant altered block at the CHEMICALNOTIN receptor site. Therefore, we conclude that the tissue and sub-cellular localization of GENEIN subunits as well as their specific associations are essential parameters to understand the in vivo effects of CHEMICALIN.
10673876	Use of CHEMICALNOTIN for an effective blood conservation strategy after total knee arthroplasty. We have investigated the effect of treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN, an inhibitor of fibrinolysis, on blood loss, blood transfusion requirements and blood coagulation in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 42 patients after total knee arthroplasty. CHEMICALNOTIN 15 mg kg-1 (n = 21) or an equivalent volume of normal saline (n = 21) was given 30 min before surgery and subsequently every 8 h for 3 days. Coagulation and fibrinolysis values, blood loss and blood units administered were measured before administration of CHEMICALNOTIN, 8 h after the end of surgery and at 24 and 72 h after operation. Coagulation profile was examined (bleeding time, platelet count, GENENOTIN time (PT), activated partial GENENOTIN time (aPTT), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN). Fibrinolysis was evaluated by measurement of concentrations of D-dimer and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Total blood loss in the CHEMICALNOTIN group was 678 (SD 352) ml compared with 1419 (607) ml in the control group (P < 0.001), and occurred primarily during the first 24 h after surgery. Thirteen patients received 1-5 u. of packed red blood cells in the control group compared with two patients in the CHEMICALNOTIN group, who received 3 u. (P < 0.001). Postoperative packed cell volume values were higher in the CHEMICALNOTIN group despite fewer blood transfusions. Postoperative concentrations of GENEIN were decreased significantly in the CHEMICALIN group (P < 0.001). Platelet count, PT, aPTT, bleeding time, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN concentrations did not differ between groups, but D-dimer concentrations were increased in the control group. Thromboembolic complications occurred in two patients in the control group compared with none in the CHEMICALNOTIN group.
10682715	Correlations between CHEMICALNOTIN level and single-cell firing in the rat's nucleus raphe magnus. The relation between CHEMICALNOTIN release and electrical activity was examined in the nucleus raphe magnus of rats anesthetized with CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN levels were monitored through a CHEMICALNOTIN-fiber microelectrode by fast cyclic voltammetry (usually at 1 Hz). Single-cell firing was recorded through the same microelectrode, except during the voltammetry waveform and associated electrical artifact (totaling about 30 ms). Multi-barrel micropipettes incorporating the voltammetry electrode were used for iontophoresis of drugs. Cells were inhibited, excited or unaffected by noxious mechanical skin stimulation. These were respectively designated as off(M) cells, on(M) cells and neutral(M) cells, M denoting mechanical. During 3 min of pinching, CHEMICALNOTIN slowly rose near seven of 14 on(M) cells and 26 of 46 off(M) cells; it fell near two off(M) cells; it was unchanged near all other cells, including six neutral(M) cells. On a finer spatiotemporal scale, near four of seven on(M) cells, 10 of 14 off(M) cells and 0 of four neutral(M) cells, average CHEMICALNOTIN levels fell significantly within +/- 100 ms of spontaneous spikes. Lower CHEMICALNOTIN may have caused the higher spike probability; the converse is theoretically unlikely, since delays between release and detection are estimated to exceed 100 ms. Increased CHEMICALNOTIN and decreased firing were always seen following iontophoresis or intravenous injection (1 mg/kg) of the CHEMICALNOTIN re-uptake inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN (n = 7). Iontophoresis of CHEMICALIN, whose serotonergic actions include antagonism and partial agonism at GENEIN receptors, also increased CHEMICALNOTIN and decreased firing (n=4). CHEMICALIN (intravenous, 1 mg/kg), whose serotonergic actions include GENEIN and GENEIN antagonism, typically raised CHEMICALNOTIN levels (four of five cells) and always blocked inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN (n = 3). Iontophoresis of CHEMICALNOTIN always lowered CHEMICALNOTIN and increased firing (n = 4). Since CHEMICALNOTIN levels and firing were usually inversely correlated, except near on(M) cells during pinch, we propose that CHEMICALNOTIN is released from terminals of incoming nociceptive afferents. Prior neuroanatomical knowledge favors a midbrain origin for these afferents, while some of the drug findings suggest that their terminals possess inhibitory serotonergic autoreceptors, possibly of GENENOTIN subtype. The released CHEMICALNOTIN could contribute to the inhibition of off(M) cells and excitation of on(M) cells by noxious stimulation, since inhibitory GENENOTIN receptors and excitatory GENENOTIN receptors, respectively, have previously been shown to dominate their serotonergic responses.
10701840	The GENEIN-specific inhibitor CHEMICALIN selectively disrupts GENEIN-mediated signaling events of T-lymphocyte activation. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is the most abundant GENENOTIN of eukaryotic cells. Its chaperone function in folding nascent proteins seems to be restricted to a subset of proteins including major components of signal transduction pathways (eg, GENENOTIN, transcription factors, and GENENOTIN). Improper function of these proteins can be induced by selective disruption of their complexes with GENEIN using the CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN. In this study, we demonstrate that CHEMICALIN treatment blocks GENEIN secretion, GENEIN expression, and proliferation of stimulated T-lymphocytes. Moreover, CHEMICALIN decreases the amount and phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN GENEIN and prevents activation of the GENEIN GENEIN. CHEMICALIN also disrupts the GENEIN-mediated activation of GENEIN (GENEIN). Treatment with CHEMICALIN, however, does not affect the activation of GENEIN, which is a plasma membrane enzyme coupled to the GENENOTIN after T-cell stimulation. Through demonstrating the selective inhibition of GENEIN-related T-lymphocyte responses by CHEMICALIN, our results emphasize the substantial role of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN complexes in T-cell activation.
10709635	CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis. Purification of GENENOTIN from rat liver. GENEIN catalyse the last step in CHEMICALIN biosynthesis, the formation of CHEMICALIN from CHEMICALIN, a reaction dependent on CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Initial attempts to purify the protein from rat liver showed that GENENOTIN is unstable. We, therefore, determined the influence of various compounds on the stability of GENENOTIN at different storage temperatures. The enzyme activity was best conserved by storing the protein at 4 degrees C in the presence of 200 g/l CHEMICALNOTIN and 10 mM CHEMICALNOTIN. We subsequently purified the enzyme from rat liver to apparent homogeneity by liquid chromatography.
10727528	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibit endothelin GENEIN by an allosteric type of mechanism. CHEMICALNOTIN is a commonly used drug with a wide pharmacological spectrum including antiplatelet, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective actions. This study shows that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, its major blood metabolite, reverse contractile actions of GENEIN (GENEIN) in isolated rat aorta and human mammary arteries. They also prevent the intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN mobilizing action of GENENOTIN in cultured endothelial cells but not those of GENENOTIN or UTP. Inhibition of the actions of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN is apparently competitive. CHEMICALIN inhibit CHEMICALIN-GENEIN binding to recombinant GENEIN. CHEMICALIN promotes dissociation of CHEMICALIN-GENEIN GENEIN complexes both in the absence and the presence of unlabeled GENEIN. It has no influence on the rate of association of CHEMICALIN-GENEIN to GENEIN. CHEMICALIN do not promote dissociation of CHEMICALIN-GENEIN GENEIN complexes. CHEMICALNOTIN potentiate relaxing actions of receptor antagonists such as CHEMICALNOTIN. It is concluded that CHEMICALIN are allosteric inhibitors of GENEIN. The results also suggest that: 1) irreversible GENENOTIN binding probably limits actions of receptor antagonists in vivo, and 2) an association of CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN antagonists should be used to evaluate the physiopathological role of GENEIN and may be of therapeutic interest in the treatment of ischemic heart disease.
10755406	A unique cytosolic activity related but distinct from GENEIN catalyses metabolic activation of CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a prototype bioreductive drug employed to treat a variety of cancers including head and neck cancer. Among the various enzymes, CHEMICALIN inhibitable cytosolic GENEIN (GENEIN) was shown to catalyse bioreductive activation of CHEMICALIN leading to cross-linking of the DNA and cytotoxicity. However, the role of GENEIN in metabolic activation of CHEMICALIN has been disputed. In this report, we present cellular and animal models to demonstrate that GENEIN may play only a minor role in metabolic activation of CHEMICALIN. We further demonstrate that bioreductive activation of CHEMICALNOTIN is catalysed by a unique cytosolic activity which is related but distinct from GENENOTIN. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were developed that permanently express higher levels of cDNA-derived GENENOTIN. These cells showed significantly increased protection against CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity. However, they failed to demonstrate higher cytotoxicity due to exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN under CHEMICALNOTIN (normal air) or hypoxia, as compared to the wild-type control CHO cells. Disruption of the GENENOTIN gene by homologous recombination generated GENENOTIN-/- mice that do not express the GENENOTIN gene resulting in the loss of GENENOTIN protein and activity. The cytosolic fractions from liver and colon tissues of GENENOTIN-/- mice showed similar amounts of DNA cross-linking upon exposure to CHEMICALIN, as observed in GENEIN+/+ mice. The unique cytosolic activity that activated CHEMICALNOTIN in cytosolic fractions of liver and colon tissues of GENENOTIN-/- mice was designated as cytosolic GENENOTIN. This activity, like GENEIN, was inhibited by CHEMICALIN and immunologically related to GENENOTIN.
10768100	CHEMICALIN reduces GENEIN expression and secretion in cultured human adipocytes. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) concentrations are characteristic for subjects with GENENOTIN resistance and could contribute to the increased cardiovascular risk in this state. In this study, we investigated the effect of CHEMICALIN, a ligand of the GENEIN GENEIN, on GENENOTIN expression and secretion in human adipocytes. METHODS: We used two models: in vitro differentiated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes cultured under serum-free conditions and isolated subcutaneous and omental fat cells kept in suspension culture. GENENOTIN protein was measured by ELISA, GENENOTIN mRNA by a semiquantitative RT-PCR technique. RESULTS: Exposure of in vitro differentiated subcutaneous adipocytes from young normal-weight females to 1 microgram/ml CHEMICALIN for 72 h caused a reduction of both GENEIN secretion (by 29 +/- 5%; p < 0.01) and GENEIN mRNA expression (by 26 +/- 3%; p < 0.05). In cultures from severely obese subjects, CHEMICALIN induced a decrease of GENEIN antigen secretion from newly differentiated omental adipocytes by 49 +/- 8% (p < 0.01) and from subcutaneous adipocytes by 30 +/- 7% (p < 0.05). Exposure of freshly isolated subcutaneous and omental adipocytes in suspension culture to CHEMICALIN induced a similar reduction of GENEIN concentration in the culture medium (by 35 +/- 11%, p < 0.05, and 33 +/- 8%, p < 0.05 compared with control, respectively). CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence that CHEMICALIN reduces GENEIN production in human adipocytes, probably at the transcriptional level. This observation could point to a new beneficial effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, particularly in obese subjects, which could be associated with a reduced cardiovascular risk.
10771044	Effect of JTH-601, a novel GENENOTIN antagonist, on prostate function in dogs. We examined the effect of CHEMICALIN (3- inverted question markCHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN inverted question mark-CHEMICALIN), a new GENEIN antagonist, on prostatic function in isolated canine prostate and in anesthetized dogs. In the contraction study, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN produced concentration-dependent contractions in canine prostate and carotid artery, respectively. In these tissues, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (a non-selective GENEIN antagonist), and CHEMICALIN (an GENEIN antagonist) competitively antagonized contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. The pA(2) (pK(B)) values with prostate were 8.49+/-0.07 for JTH-601, 7.94+/-0.04 for CHEMICALNOTIN and 9.42+/-0.22 for CHEMICALNOTIN. The ratio of pA(2) (carotid artery/prostate), i.e. prostatic selectivity, was 10.471 for CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.008 for CHEMICALNOTIN and 0.371 for CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. In anesthetized dogs, CHEMICALNOTIN (1 mg/kg, i.d.) significantly decreased urethral pressure by 15% without affecting blood pressure or heart rate. CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1 mg/kg, i.d.) decreased urethral pressure to the same extent as did CHEMICALNOTIN, but with a significant effect on blood pressure and heart rate. CHEMICALNOTIN showed higher selectivity for canine prostate both in vitro and in vivo. In prostate, an important role of the GENENOTIN is suggested in the smooth muscle contraction mediated by GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN is expected to be an effective GENEIN antagonist for the treatment of urinary outlet obstruction by benign prostatic hypertrophy with a minimum effect on the cardiovascular system.
10831596	Severe impairment of salivation in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-deficient mice. The salivary fluid secretory mechanism is thought to require GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake. To directly test this possibility we studied the in vivo and in vitro functioning of acinar cells from the parotid glands of mice with targeted disruption of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the gene encoding the salivary GENENOTIN. In wild-type mice GENENOTIN was localized to the basolateral membranes of parotid acinar cells, whereas expression was not detected in duct cells. The lack of functional GENENOTIN resulted in a dramatic reduction (>60%) in the volume of saliva secreted in response to a muscarinic agonist, the primary in situ salivation signal. Consistent with defective CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, a loss of CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN influx was observed in parotid acinar cells from mice lacking GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN activity was increased in parotid acinar cells isolated from knockout mice suggesting that the residual saliva secreted by mice lacking GENENOTIN is associated with anion exchanger-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. Indeed, expression of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN was enhanced suggesting that this transporter compensates for the loss of functional GENENOTIN. Furthermore, the ability of the parotid gland to conserve CHEMICALNOTIN was abolished in GENENOTIN-deficient mice. This deficit was not associated with changes in the morphology of the ducts, but transcript levels for the alpha-, beta-, and gamma-subunits of the epithelial CHEMICALNOTIN channel were reduced. These data directly demonstrate that GENEIN is the major CHEMICALIN uptake mechanism across the basolateral membrane of acinar cells and is critical for driving saliva secretion in vivo.
10907719	Evaluation of in vivo binding properties of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in mouse brain. UNLABELLED: Apparent GENEIN occupancy in mouse cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum by CHEMICALIN, an antagonist, and CHEMICALIN, a relatively selective GENEIN antagonist, was estimated with competitive binding studies using two different radioligands: CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Both radioligands labeled GENEIN in these brain regions, and the relative regional distributions of the specific binding of CHEMICALIN in vivo paralleled the distribution of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN binding in vivo was much more sensitive to direct competitive inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN than was CHEMICALNOTIN. A similar discrepancy in sensitivity to competitors between CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN was also observed when CHEMICALIN was used as a competitor, indicating that binding to different subtypes of the GENEIN could not account for the observed differences in sensitivity to competition. An in vivo saturation study suggested that the apparent association rate constant (k on) of CHEMICALNOTIN binding might be changed by ligand concentration. The heterogeneity of the free ligand concentration in intact brain was assessed in relation to the ligand concentration dependency of the apparent association rate constant (k on) of CHEMICALNOTIN binding. This finding, together with the more favorable accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN in cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and striatum, leads us to conclude that CHEMICALIN, or its positron emitting counterpart, should be the more favorable radiotracer for the estimation of GENEIN occupancy by cholinergic drugs in the brain. KEYWORDS: GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, in vivo, mouse.
10909982	Impaired expression of the GENENOTIN gene in skeletal muscle during lactation: fibrates and CHEMICALIN reverse lactation-induced downregulation of the GENEIN gene. The expression of GENENOTIN mRNA in skeletal muscle is dramatically reduced during lactation in mice. The reduction in GENENOTIN mRNA levels lowers the amount of the GENENOTIN protein in skeletal muscle mitochondria during lactation. Spontaneous or abrupt weaning reverses the downregulation of the GENENOTIN mRNA but not the reduction in GENENOTIN protein levels. In lactating and virgin mice, however, fasting increases GENENOTIN mRNA levels. Changes in GENEIN mRNA occur in parallel with modifications in the levels of free CHEMICALIN, which are reduced in lactation and are upregulated due to weaning or fasting. Modifications in the energy nutritional stress of lactating dams achieved by manipulating litter sizes do not influence GENENOTIN mRNA levels in skeletal muscle. Conversely, when mice are fed a high-fat diet after parturition, the downregulation of GENEIN mRNA and GENEIN protein levels due to lactation is partially reversed, as is the reduction in serum free CHEMICALIN levels. Treatment of lactating mice with a single injection of CHEMICALIN, an activator of the GENEIN (GENEIN), raises GENEIN mRNA in skeletal muscle to levels similar to those in virgin mice. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a specific ligand of the GENEIN subtype, causes the most dramatic increase in GENEIN mRNA, whereas CHEMICALIN, a specific activator of GENEIN, also significantly increases GENEIN mRNA abundance in skeletal muscle of lactating mice. However, in virgin mice, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN do not significantly affect GENEIN mRNA expression, whereas CHEMICALIN is at least as effective as it is in lactating dams. It is proposed that the GENEIN gene is regulated in skeletal muscle during lactation in response to changes in circulating free CHEMICALIN by mechanisms involving activation of GENEIN. The impaired expression of the GENEIN gene is consistent with the involvement of GENEIN gene regulation in the reduction of the use of CHEMICALIN as fuel by the skeletal muscle and in impaired adaptative thermogenesis, both of which are major metabolic adaptations that occur during lactation.
10935465	The apoptosome: heart and soul of the cell death machine. Apoptosis is a fundamental biologic process by which metazoan cells orchestrate their own self-demise. Genetic analyses of the nematode C elegans identified three core components of the suicide apparatus which include CED-3, CED-4, and CED-9. An analogous set of core constituents exists in mammalian cells and includes caspase-9, Apaf-1, and bcl-2/xL, respectively. CED-3 and CED-4, along with their mammalian counterparts, function to kill cells, whereas CED-9 and its mammalian equivalents protect cells from death. These central components biochemically intermingle in a ternary complex recently dubbed the "apoptosome." The C elegans protein EGL-1 and its mammalian counterparts, pro-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family, induce cell death by disrupting apoptosome interactions. Thus, EGL-1 may represent a primordial signal integrator for the apoptosome. Various biochemical processes including oligomerization, adenosine triphosphate ATP/dATP binding, and cytochrome c interaction play a role in regulating the ternary death complex. Recent studies suggest that cell death receptors, such as CD95, may amplify their suicide signal by activating the apoptosome. These mutual associations by core components of the suicide apparatus provide a molecular framework in which diverse death signals likely interface. Understanding the apoptosome and its cellular connections will facilitate the design of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer and other disease states in which apoptosis plays a pivotal role.
10953053	CHEMICALIN, a novel anti-convulsant, enhances activation of GENENOTIN GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN [CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN] is a novel anticonvulsant, unrelated to currently available antiepileptic agents, with activity in a broad range of seizure models. In the present study, we sought to determine whether retigabine could enhance current through M-like currents in PC12 cells and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO-GENENOTIN). In differentiated PC12 cells, retigabine enhanced a CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive current. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was associated with a slowing of M-like tail current deactivation in these cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1 to 10 microM) induced a CHEMICALNOTIN current and hyperpolarized CHO cells expressing GENENOTIN cells but not in wild-type cells. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced currents in CHO-GENENOTIN cells were inhibited by 60.6 +/- 11% (n = 4) by the GENENOTIN blocker, CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM), and 82.7 +/- 5.4% (n = 4) by CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mM). The mechanism by which CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced GENENOTIN currents involved large, drug-induced, leftward shifts in the voltage dependence of channel activation (-33.1 +/- 2.6 mV, n = 4, by 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN shifted the voltage dependence of channel activation with an EC(50) value of 1.6 +/- 0.3 microM (slope factor was 1.2 +/- 0.1, n = 4 to 5 cells per concentration). CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1 to 10 microM) also slowed the rate of channel deactivation, predominantly by increasing the contribution of a slowly deactivating tail current component. Our findings identify GENENOTIN channels as a molecular target for CHEMICALNOTIN and suggest that activation of GENENOTIN channels may be responsible for at least some of the anticonvulsant activity of this agent.
10980326	GENEIN gene regulatory region polymorphism (GENEIN), CHEMICALIN binding in healthy control subjects and alcohol-dependent patients and their relationships to impulsivity. The aim of this study was to investigate CHEMICALNOTIN binding and impulsivity in CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent and age-matched control subjects in relation to a 5'-promoter region GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) polymorphism (GENENOTIN). Alcohol-dependent subjects were hypothesized to show a decreased number of bindings sites and a lower dissociation constant. GENENOTIN S-genotype carriers in both CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent and control subjects were expected to show significantly fewer binding sites and a lower dissociation constant. Influences of impulsive traits, chronic daily CHEMICALNOTIN intake, duration of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence, age of onset and age on CHEMICALNOTIN binding were also investigated. Inpatients meeting DSM IV CHEMICALNOTIN dependence criteria and of German descent were recruited to avoid ethnic stratification effects. One hundred and seventeen control subjects of similar social status were recruited from a town community. Blood samples were taken from both CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent and control subjects to determine GENEIN genotypes using PCR of lymphocyte DNA, and to perform platelet CHEMICALIN binding (binding capacity: B(max); and dissociation constant: K(D)). Impulsivity was assessed using the Barratt impulsiveness scale version 5 (BIS-5) in CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent subjects only. CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent subjects were subdivided into low or high impulsivity groups using a median-split of the BIS-5 scale. The control group was slightly older than the alcohol-dependent group (not statistically significant). CHEMICALNOTIN binding was investigated in 72 control subjects and 72 patients, of which five patients met type 2 CHEMICALNOTIN dependence criteria. Genotyping was carried out in all patients and control subjects. A significant influence of duration of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence was found on the CHEMICALNOTIN binding K(D) but not B(max.) Neither CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent nor control subjects showed any differences in B(max) or K(D). S-allele carriers did not show a decreased binding or lower dissociation constant. Furthermore, no significant interaction between B(max) and K(D) with either GENENOTIN genotype or impulsivity was revealed. This was the first study to investigate platelet CHEMICALIN binding in CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent and age-matched control subjects in relation to the GENEIN genotype. No differences concerning GENENOTIN-alleles were found in these groups Furthermore, no significant interaction between these parameters and impulsivity was shown in CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent subjects. These results do not support previous results of altered CHEMICALIN binding sites in alcohol-dependent subjects or GENEIN S-allele carriers. K(D) might be influenced by duration of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence, but not sufficiently to yield differences between CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent and control subjects.
11006278	CHEMICALIN and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce conformational changes in the GENEIN (GENEIN). By using the technique of site-directed spin labeling combined with EPR spectroscopy, we have observed that binding of CHEMICALIN and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induces conformational changes in the GENEIN (GENEIN). Line shape broadening resulting from spin-spin coupling of CHEMICALIN pairs introduced into the membrane-binding helices of GENEIN was used to calculate the inter-helical distances and changes in these distances that occur in response to binding various ligands. The inter-residue distances determined for the GENENOTIN holoenzyme using EPR were 1-7.9 A shorter than those of the crystal structure of the GENENOTIN holoenzyme. However, inter-helical distances calculated and determined by EPR for GENEIN complexed with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN were in close agreement with those obtained from the cognate crystal structures. These results indicate that the structure of the solubilized GENENOTIN holoenzyme measured in solution differs from the crystal structure of GENENOTIN holoenzyme obtained by x-ray analysis. Furthermore, binding of ligands induces a conformational change in the holo-GENENOTIN, converting it to a structure similar to those obtained by x-ray analysis. Proteolysis protection assays had previously provided circumstantial evidence that binding of heme and non-CHEMICALIN anti-inflammatory drugs alters the conformation of GENEIN, but the present experiments are the first to directly measure such changes. The finding that CHEMICALIN can also induce a conformational change in GENEIN was unexpected, and the magnitude of changes suggests this structural flexibility may be integral to the GENEIN catalytic mechanism.
11054378	Suppression of GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN is mediated by direct inhibition of GENENOTIN. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Activation of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Various drugs used in the treatment of IBD, such as glucocorticoids, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, interfere with GENEIN/GENEIN signaling. The aim of this study was to define the molecular mechanism by which CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN activation. METHODS: The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and its moieties on GENENOTIN signaling were evaluated using electromobility shift, transfection, and immune complex kinase assays. The direct effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity was investigated using purified recombinant GENENOTIN proteins. RESULTS: GENEIN/GENEIN activity induced by GENENOTIN, CHEMICALIN, or overexpression of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, or constitutively active GENEIN and GENEIN mutants was inhibited dose dependently by CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-induced activation of endogenous GENEIN in Jurkat T cells and SW620 colon cells, as well as the catalytic activity of purified GENEIN and GENEIN in vitro. In contrast, the moieties of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN had no effect. Activation of GENENOTIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN was unaffected by CHEMICALIN. The decrease in substrate phosphorylation by GENENOTIN is associated with a decrease in autophosphorylation of GENEIN and can be antagonized by excess CHEMICALIN. CONCLUSIONS: These data identify CHEMICALNOTIN as a direct inhibitor of GENENOTIN by antagonizing CHEMICALNOTIN binding. The suppression of GENEIN activation by inhibition of the GENEIN contributes to the well-known anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects of CHEMICALIN.
11078056	Biochemistry of GENENOTIN inhibitors and molecular pathology of GENENOTIN in neoplasia. Several types of human tumors overexpress GENENOTIN but not GENENOTIN, and gene knockout transfection experiments demonstrate a central role of GENENOTIN in experimental tumorigenesis. GENEIN produces CHEMICALIN that inhibit apoptosis and stimulate angiogenesis and invasiveness. Selective GENENOTIN inhibitors reduce CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis, restore apoptosis, and inhibit cancer cell proliferation. In animal studies they limit carcinogen-induced tumorigenesis. In contrast, CHEMICALIN-like nonselective NSAIDs such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibit not only the enzymatic action of the highly inducible, proinflammatory GENEIN but the constitutively expressed, cytoprotective GENEIN as well. Consequently, nonselective NSAIDs can cause platelet dysfunction, gastrointestinal ulceration, and kidney damage. For that reason, selective inhibition of GENENOTIN to treat neoplastic proliferation is preferable to nonselective inhibition. Selective GENEIN inhibitors, such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), are NSAIDs that have been modified chemically to preferentially inhibit GENEIN but not GENEIN. For instance, CHEMICALIN inhibits the growth of cultured colon cancer cells (HCA-7 and Moser-S) that express GENEIN but has no effect on HCT-116 tumor cells that do not express GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN induces apoptosis in GENENOTIN expressing LNCaP prostate cancer cells and, surprisingly, in colon cancer S/KS cells that does not express GENENOTIN. This effect may due to induction of apoptosis through uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and down-regulation of GENEIN, as has been demonstrated for some nonselective NSAIDs, for instance, CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN mRNA and GENENOTIN protein is constitutively expressed in the kidney, brain, spinal cord, and ductus deferens, and in the uterus during implantation. In addition, GENENOTIN is constitutively and dominantly expressed in the pancreatic islet cells. These findings might somewhat limit the use of presently available selective GENENOTIN inhibitors in cancer prevention but will probably not deter their successful application for the treatment of human cancers.
11106255	The GENENOTIN inhibitor carbidopa is selectively cytotoxic to human pulmonary carcinoid and small cell lung carcinoma cells. The carcinoid tumor is an uncommon neuroendocrine neoplasm the hallmark of which is excessive CHEMICALNOTIN production. In studying kinetics of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in human carcinoid hepatic metastases and adjacent normal liver (J. A. Gilbert et al, Biochem. Pharmacol., 50: 845-850, 1995), we identified one significant difference: the Vmax of carcinoid GENENOTIN was 50-fold higher than that in normal liver. Here, we report Western and Northern analyses detecting large quantities of GENENOTIN polypeptide and mRNA in human carcinoid primary as well as metastatic tumors compared with normal surrounding tissues. To assess the feasibility of targeting these high GENENOTIN levels for chemotherapy, GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) were incubated (72 h) with NCI-H727 human lung carcinoid cells. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were lethal (IC50 = 29 +/- 2 microM and 56 +/- 6 microM, respectively); CHEMICALNOTIN had no effect on proliferation. On exposure to other human tumor lines, CHEMICALNOTIN was lethal only to NCI-H146 and NCI-H209 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) lines (IC50 = 12 +/- 1 microM and 22 +/- 5 microM, respectively). CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microM) decreased growth of (but did not kill) SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells and did not affect proliferation of DU 145 prostate, MCF7 breast, or NCI-H460 large cell lung carcinoma lines. The rank order of lines by GENENOTIN activity was NCI-H146 > NCI-H209 > SK-N-SH > NCI-H727, whereas A204, DU 145, MCF7, and NCI-H460 had no measurable activity. For lung tumor lines (carcinoid, two SCLC, and one large cell lung carcinoma), GENEIN activity was correlated with the potency of CHEMICALIN-induced cytotoxicity. However, carcinoid cell death was not solely attributable to complete inhibition of either GENENOTIN activity or the CHEMICALNOTIN synthetic pathway. In further evaluating potential applications of these findings with CHEMICALNOTIN, we determined that sublethal doses of CHEMICALNOTIN produced additive cytotoxic effects in carcinoid cells in combination with etoposide and cytotoxic synergy in SCLC cells when coincubated with CHEMICALNOTIN.
11141093	CHEMICALIN derivatives as GENEIN inhibitors. In a search for less flexible analogues of CHEMICALIN (1), a CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN endowed with an interesting GENEIN affinity profile, we discovered compound 2, in which the terminal CHEMICALNOTIN groups of 1 have been incorporated into a CHEMICALNOTIN system. Since this compound retains good GENEIN inhibitory activity and its CHEMICALIN moiety is reminiscent of the CHEMICALIN (3), we have designed and synthesized CHEMICALNOTIN 4-6, and their biological evaluation has been assessed in vitro against GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN 4 was almost as potent as CHEMICALNOTIN and was 60- and 550-fold more potent than the 7-carbamate 5 and the 8-carbamate 6, respectively. The two enantiomers of 4, (-)-4 and (+)-4, did not show a marked enantioselectivity. Finally, a similar time-dependent pattern of inhibition of GENENOTIN was observed for 3 and 4.
11155778	Brugada syndrome without mutation of the cardiac sodium channel gene in a Taiwanese patient. We describe a 45-year-old Taiwanese man with specific features of Brugada syndrome but no clinical features of structural heart disease. He was successfully treated with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. His electrocardiogram (ECG) patterns changed intermittently. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation and beta-adrenoceptor blockade augmented the characteristic ST-segment elevation, whereas alpha-adrenoceptor blockade and beta-adrenoceptor stimulation mitigated the ST-segment elevation. Intravenous procainamide administration did not aggravate ST-segment elevation when ECG had shown coved ST elevation in the right precordial leads. Molecular study did not reveal the same mutations in the cardiac sodium channel gene (SCN5A) as previously reported in Brugada syndrome. This case demonstrates the genetic heterogeneity of SCN5A in Brugada syndrome.
11161433	Breakdown of Th cell immune responses and steroidogenic GENENOTIN expression in CD4+ T cells in a murine model implanted with B16 melanoma. The association between the balance of Th1/Th2 cell responses and GENENOTIN expression in CD4+ T cells was investigated in a murine model implanted with highly metastatic B16F10 melanoma cells (B16F10 mice). When 2 x 10(5) cells/mouse of B16F10 cells were inoculated into C57BL/6 mice, Th2 cell responses and pulmonary metastasis were increased. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN levels in splenic tissue or serum and GENENOTIN mRNA expression (mRNA encoding GENENOTIN) in CD4+ T cells were increased in these mice. When the anti-corticosterone drug CHEMICALIN (GENEIN inhibitor) was administered to B16F10 mice, CHEMICALNOTIN levels in splenic tissue or serum and GENEIN mRNA expression were decreased at 14 days after tumor inoculation. In addition, Th1 cell responses were restored and pulmonary metastasis was reduced by CHEMICALNOTIN. These results indicated that the breakdown of Th cell responses and increase of pulmonary metastasis were due to an increase in steroidogenic GENENOTIN mRNA expression in CD4+ T cells. Moreover, it was suggested that promotion of GENEIN mRNA expression in Th2 cells was partially involved due to an increase in level of CHEMICALIN in splenic tissue and the breakdown of Th cell responses locally in the splenic tissue, which then affected the maintenance of Th2 cell functions in the microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice.
11181577	A nonsense mutation in the GENENOTIN gene encoding the GENENOTIN abolishes assembly and activity of the complex in a patient with Leigh-like syndrome. Sequence analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear candidate genes of GENENOTIN in children with deficiency of this complex and exhibiting Leigh-like syndrome has revealed, in one of them, a novel mutation in the GENENOTIN gene encoding the 18 kDa subunit. Phosphorylation of this subunit by GENENOTIN has previously been found to activate the complex. The present mutation consists of a homozygous G-->A transition at nucleotide position +44 of the coding sequence of the gene, resulting in the change of a CHEMICALNOTIN codon to a stop codon. Such mutation causes premature termination of the protein after only 14 CHEMICALNOTIN of the putative mitochondrial targeting peptide. Fibroblast cultures from the patient exhibited severe reduction of the rotenone-sensitive GENEIN activity of GENEIN, which was insensitive to CHEMICALIN stimulation. Two-dimensional electrophoresis showed the absence of detectable normally assembled GENENOTIN in the inner mitochondrial membrane. These findings show that the expression of the GENENOTIN gene is essential for the assembly of a functional GENENOTIN.
11212269	GENENOTIN reduces chemotherapy-associated mortality and enhances cell survival in cells expressing a transfected GENENOTIN. Chemotherapeutic agents produce cytotoxicity via induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest. Rapidly proliferating cells in the bone marrow and intestinal crypts are highly susceptible to chemotherapy, and damage to these cellular compartments may preclude maximally effective chemotherapy administration. GENENOTIN is an enteroendocrine-derived regulatory peptide that inhibits crypt cell apoptosis after administration of agents that damage the intestinal epithelium. We report here that a human degradation-resistant GENEIN analogue, h[CHEMICALIN]-GENENOTIN significantly improves survival, reduces bacteremia, attenuates epithelial injury, and inhibits crypt apoptosis in the murine gastrointestinal tract after administration of GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN or the antimetabolite CHEMICALNOTIN. h[CHEMICALNOTIN]-GENENOTIN significantly improved survival and reduced weight loss but did not impair chemotherapy effectiveness in tumor-bearing mice treated with cyclical irinotecan. Furthermore, h[CHEMICALIN]-GENENOTIN reduced chemotherapy-induced apoptosis, decreased activation of GENENOTIN, and inhibited GENEIN cleavage in heterologous cells transfected with the GENEIN. These observations demonstrate that the antiapoptotic effects of GENENOTIN on intestinal crypt cells may be useful for the attenuation of chemotherapy-induced intestinal mucositis.
11255924	On the relationship between the GENENOTIN and the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys: practical and theoretical concerns. RATIONALE: Drugs that are self-administered appear to vary in their potency and effectiveness as positive reinforcers. Understanding mechanisms that determine relative effectiveness of drugs as reinforcers will enhance our understanding of drug abuse. OBJECTIVES: The hypothesis of the present study was that differences among GENEIN (GENEIN) ligands in potency and effectiveness as a positive reinforcers were related to potency and effectiveness as CHEMICALIN uptake inhibitors. Accordingly, self-administration of a group of local anesthetics that are GENEIN ligands was compared to their effects as CHEMICALIN uptake blockers in vitro in brain tissue. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were allowed to self-administer CHEMICALNOTIN and other local anesthetics i.v. under a progressive-ratio schedule. The same compounds were compared in standard in vitro CHEMICALNOTIN uptake assays using monkey caudate tissue. RESULTS: The rank order of both potency and effectiveness as reinforcers was CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN did not maintain self-administration. For inhibiting CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, the potency order was CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN. At maximum, these compounds were equally effective in blocking CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. CHEMICALNOTIN did not inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. CONCLUSIONS: The potency of local anesthetics as positive reinforcers is likely related to their potency as CHEMICALNOTIN uptake inhibitors. Variation in their effectiveness as positive reinforcers was not a function of differences in effectiveness as CHEMICALNOTIN uptake blockers, but may be related to relative potency over the concentrations that are achieved in vivo. Effects at GENENOTIN may limit the reinforcing effects of local anesthetics.
11292635	Contribution of the GENEIN GENEIN to CHEMICALIN secretion in rat OMCD. In rat kidney the "secretory" isoform of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) localizes to the basolateral membrane of the alpha-intercalated cell. The purpose of this study was to determine whether rat outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) secretes CHEMICALNOTIN and whether transepithelial CHEMICALNOTIN transport occurs, in part, through CHEMICALIN uptake across the basolateral membrane mediated by GENEIN in series with CHEMICALIN efflux across the apical membrane. OMCD tubules from rats treated with CHEMICALNOTIN were perfused in vitro in symmetrical CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN-buffered solutions. CHEMICALNOTIN secretion was observed in this segment, accompanied by a lumen positive transepithelial potential. CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microM), when added to the bath, reduced CHEMICALNOTIN secretion by 78%, although the lumen positive transepithelial potential and fluid flux were unchanged. CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN secretion was dependent on extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN and either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, consistent with the ion dependency of GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN transport. In conclusion, OMCD tubules from CHEMICALIN-treated rats secrete CHEMICALIN into the luminal fluid through GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake across the basolateral membrane in series with CHEMICALIN efflux across the apical membrane. The physiological role of GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake remains to be determined. However, the role of GENENOTIN in the process of fluid secretion could not be demonstrated.
11344206	Evidence for genetic heterogeneity of pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1: identification of a novel mutation in the GENENOTIN in one sporadic case and no mutations in two autosomal dominant kindreds. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1) is characterized by neonatal salt wasting resistant to mineralocorticoids. There are 2 forms of PHA1: the autosomal recessive form with symptoms persisting into adulthood, caused by mutations in the GENENOTIN, and the autosomal dominant or sporadic form, which shows milder symptoms that remit with age. Mutations in the gene encoding the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are, at least in some patients, responsible for the latter form of PHA1. We here report the results of a genetic study in a sporadic case and in 5 affected patients from 2 families with autosomal dominant PHA1. In the sporadic case we identified a new frameshift mutation, GENENOTIN, in exon 9 of the GENENOTIN gene. Family members were asymptomatic and had no mutation. This mutation is the first described in exon 9 and impairs the last 27 CHEMICALIN of the GENEIN. In 2 kindreds with autosomal dominant PHA1 we found no mutation of the GENENOTIN gene. Our results confirm the hypothesis that autosomal dominant or sporadic PHA1 is a genetically heterogeneous disease involving other, as yet unidentified, genes.
11350861	The broad-spectrum anti-emetic activity of CHEMICALIN, a novel GENENOTIN and GENEIN antagonist. The anti-emetic and pharmacological profile of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a novel and potent GENENOTIN and GENEIN ligand, was investigated in the present study. In guinea-pig isolated colon, CHEMICALIN produced a rightward shift of the concentration-response curves of CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN agonist (pA2 value of 7.04). Other GENEIN antagonists also produced such a shift in the following antagonistic-potency order: CHEMICALIN> CHEMICALIN=CHEMICALIN>>CHEMICALIN. In mice, CHEMICALIN (1.0 - 3.0 mg kg(-1) s.c.) potently inhibited hypothermia induced by the GENEIN agonist; CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) (0.3 mg kg(-1) s.c.). CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, which have affinity for GENEIN, also inhibited CHEMICALIN-induced hypothermia. In ferrets or dogs, CHEMICALNOTIN dose-dependently inhibited emesis induced by CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN with ID50 values of 2.22 microg kg(-1) s.c., 10.5 microg kg(-1) s.c., 14.2 microg kg(-1) i.v. and 17.6 microg kg(-1) i.v., respectively. Moreover, oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN significantly inhibited emesis induced by these emetogens. CHEMICALNOTIN (0.3 mg kg(-1) i.v.) significantly inhibited emesis induced by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. In conclusion, CHEMICALIN is a potent GENENOTIN and GENEIN antagonist, and a novel anti-emetic agent with a broad-spectrum of anti-emetic activity. These results suggest that this compound is worthy of clinical investigation.
11369259	Heparin-binding exosite of GENENOTIN. Recent studies have indicated that the basic residues CHEMICALIN(93), CHEMICALIN(96), CHEMICALIN(125), CHEMICALIN(165), CHEMICALIN(169), CHEMICALIN(236), and CHEMICALIN(240) (GENEIN numbering) constitute an exosite in the catalytic domain of GENEIN that can effectively bind heparin only if the acidic GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN was neutralized by physiological levels of CHEMICALNOTIN. Binding of a full-length heparin chain to this site of GENENOTIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN makes a significant contribution to acceleration of the GENENOTIN inhibition by GENENOTIN through a ternary complex bridging or template mechanism. Moreover, certain basic residues of this site, particularly CHEMICALIN(165) and CHEMICALIN(169), play a key role in GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN recognition by GENEIN in the prothrombinase complex. This article reviews recent structural, mutagenesis and kinetic data that lead to identification of this exosite and discusses how the binding of protein or polysaccharide cofactors to this site of GENENOTIN can modulate the specificity and physiological function of this key coagulant enzyme in plasma.
11398914	CHEMICALNOTIN: a review of its use in the management of osteoarthritis, acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis. CHEMICALIN is a selective GENEIN inhibitor which has little or no effect on the GENEIN isoenzyme at doses up to 1000 mg/day. CHEMICALIN has greater selectivity for GENEIN than CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. In well-controlled clinical trials, CHEMICALNOTIN 12.5 to 500 mg/day has been evaluated for its efficacy in the treatment of osteoarthritis, acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis [lower dosages (5 to 125 mg/day) were generally used in the chronic pain indications]. In the treatment of patients with osteoarthritis, CHEMICALNOTIN was more effective in providing symptomatic relief than placebo, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN and was similar in efficacy to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Overall, both the physician's assessment of disease status and the patient's assessment of response to therapy tended to favour CHEMICALNOTIN. In patients with postsurgical dental pain, pain after spinal fusion or orthopaedic surgery, or primary dysmenorrhoea, CHEMICALNOTIN provided more rapid and more sustained pain relief and reduced requirements for supplemental morphine use after surgery than placebo. CHEMICALNOTIN was more efficacious than CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with acute dental pain and pain after spinal fusion surgery, although CHEMICALNOTIN may have been used at a subtherapeutic dose. In comparison with traditional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN was similar in efficacy in the treatment of acute pain. Although CHEMICALNOTIN provided more rapid pain relief than CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with primary dysmenorrhoea, the reverse was true after orthopaedic surgery: CHEMICALNOTIN provided more rapid pain relief and less supplemental CHEMICALNOTIN was needed. CHEMICALNOTIN was as effective as CHEMICALNOTIN in providing symptomatic relief for over 8700 patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Compared with traditional NSAID therapy, CHEMICALNOTIN had a significantly lower incidence of endoscopically confirmed gastroduodenal ulceration and, in approximately 13,000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, a lower incidence of gastrointestinal (GI) adverse events. CHEMICALNOTIN was generally well tolerated in all indications with an overall tolerability profile similar to traditional NSAIDs. The most common adverse events in CHEMICALNOTIN recipients were nausea, dizziness and headache. In conclusion, CHEMICALNOTIN is at least as effective as traditional NSAID therapy in providing pain relief for both chronic and acute pain conditions. CHEMICALNOTIN provides an alternative treatment option to traditional NSAID therapy in the management of symptomatic pain relief in patients with osteoarthritis. Initial data from patients with primary dysmenorrhoea and postoperative pain are promising and further trials may confirm its place in the treatment of these indications. CHEMICALNOTIN has also shown promising results in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and is likely to become a valuable addition to current drug therapy for this patient population. Importantly, CHEMICALNOTIN is associated with a lower incidence of GI adverse events than traditional NSAIDs making it a primary treatment option in patients at risk of developing GI complications or patients with chronic conditions requiring long term treatment.
11456284	Clinical, biochemical and molecular genetic data in five children with Gitelman's syndrome. Gitelman's variant of Bartter's syndrome, inherited hypokalemic alkalosis, is caused by mutation in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The main clinical symptoms are: muscular weakness, carpopedal spasm, constipation and short stature. The diagnosis was suspected in five children according to clinical criteria. All patients exhibited carpopedal spasm during febrile illness, three patients had short stature. Biochemical features were: metabolic alkalosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, low GENENOTIN levels, hyperkaliuria, hypernatriuria, hypocalciuria and normoprostaglandinuria. Three patients had elevated plasma GENENOTIN activity and hyperaldosteronism. Mutational analysis of the GENENOTIN gene confirmed the diagnosis in all five patients. Different forms of therapy, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN substitution, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN failed to fully correct hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, but markedly improved growth velocity and normalized GENEIN levels in the three patients with short stature. During therapy, clinical symptoms disappeared. We conclude that Gitelman's syndrome is a disorder with a variable symptom profile, but can be suspected on clinical signs already in early childhood. The early diagnosis is essential in preventing complications.
11474486	GENENOTIN subtype-specific regulation of hepatic and peripheral gene expression in the Zucker diabetic fatty rat. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are used clinically to treat hypertriglyceridemia and hyperglycemia, respectively. CHEMICALIN bind to the GENEIN, and CHEMICALIN are ligands of GENEIN. These intracellular receptors form heterodimers with GENENOTIN to modulate gene transcription. To elucidate the target genes regulated by these compounds, we treated Zucker diabetic fatty rats (ZDF) for 15 days with a GENEIN-specific compound, CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN-specific ligand, CHEMICALIN, and a GENENOTIN coagonist, CHEMICALNOTIN, and measured the levels of several messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in liver by real-time polymerase chain reaction. All 3 compounds decreased serum CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN induced expression of GENEIN and GENEIN and reduced GENEIN and GENEIN mRNAs. CHEMICALIN modestly increased GENEIN mRNA and had no effect on expression of the other 2 genes in the liver but increased the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in adipose tissue. We identified a novel target in liver, GENENOTIN, whose down-regulation by GENENOTIN agonists may improve GENENOTIN sensitivity in that tissue by prolonging GENENOTIN responses. The results of these studies suggest that activation of GENENOTIN as well as GENENOTIN in therapy for type 2 diabetes will enhance CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN control by combining actions in hepatic and peripheral tissues.
11513839	Serotonergic effects and extracellular brain levels of eletriptan, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan in rat brain. In vivo microdialysis was used to assess the central serotonergic effects and extracellular brain levels of the 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonists eletriptan, zolmitriptan and sumatriptan in rats after intravenous and intracerebral administration, while their binding affinities and functional potencies were determined at 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(1D) and 5-HT(1A) receptors. In vitro studies showed that all three triptans are high affinity, full agonists at 5-HT(1B/1D) receptors, but that sumatriptan is functionally less potent as a 5-HT(1B/1D) agonist than zolmitriptan and eletriptan. Local intracortical perfusion with the compounds via the dialysis probe decreased cortical 5-HT (5-hydroxytryptamine, serotonin) release with ED(50) values of approximately 0.1 microM for eletriptan and zolmitriptan and 0.5 microM for sumatriptan. At 3.2 mg/kg i.v., both eletriptan and zolmitriptan decreased 5-HT levels by about 35%, while sumatriptan had no effect, despite the fact that maximal sumatriptan concentrations in cortical dialysates were higher (8.8 nM at 20 min) than those of zolmitriptan (5.9 nM at 20 min) and eletriptan (2.6 nM at 40 min). The observation that eletriptan and zolmitriptan produce almost identical central serotonergic effects, after intracerebral as well as after systemic administration, is in agreement with their comparable functional 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist potencies and their free levels in cortical dialysates after 3.2 mg/kg i.v. On the other hand, the lack of central serotonergic effects of 3.2 mg/kg i.v. sumatriptan is likely due to its weaker functional 5-HT(1B/1D) receptor agonist potency than eletriptan and zolmitriptan, rather than lower brain levels, consistent with sumatriptan's fivefold lower potency after intracerebral administration.
11544332	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN efficiently convert GENENOTIN into its active. We have previously isolated from human hemofiltrate an CHEMICALIN-terminally truncated form of the GENEIN (GENEIN), and characterized GENENOTIN as a strong agonist of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and to a lower extent GENENOTIN. In this study, we show that conditioned media from human tumor cell lines PC-3 and 143B contain proteolytic activities that convert GENENOTIN into the [9-74] form. This activity was fully inhibited by inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), including GENENOTIN, an anti-GENENOTIN mAb, and amiloride. Pure preparations of GENENOTIN processed GENENOTIN with high efficiency, without further degrading GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN could also generate GENENOTIN, but degraded the active product as well. The kinetics of GENENOTIN cleavage by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (Michaelis constant, K(m), of 0.76 +/- 0.4 microM for GENENOTIN, and 0.096 +/- 0.05 microM for GENENOTIN; catalytic rate constant, k(cat): 3.36 +/- 0.96 s(-1) for GENENOTIN and 6 +/- 3.6 s(-1) for GENENOTIN) are fully compatible with a role in vivo. The activation of an abundant inactive precursor into a broad-spectrum chemokine by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN directly links the production of GENENOTIN by numerous tumors and their ability to recruit mononuclear leukocytes, without the need for the transcriptional activation of GENENOTIN genes.
11551210	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN sites on the GENEIN and their allosteric interaction. CHEMICALIN are general anesthetics which can also act as uncharged noncompetitive inhibitors of the peripheral GENEIN (GENENOTIN) by binding to one or more specific sites on the GENEIN. CHEMICALIN are naturally occurring, uncharged noncompetitive inhibitors of peripheral and neuronal GENEIN, which have no demonstrable general anesthetic activity in vivo. In this study, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), an analogue of the cationic noncompetitive inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), was used to characterize the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN sites on the desensitized Torpedo californica GENENOTIN and to investigate if these sites interact. These studies confirm that there is a single cembranoid site which sterically overlaps the CHEMICALNOTIN channel site. This CHEMICALNOTIN site probably also overlaps the sites for the cationic noncompetitive inhibitors, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Evidence is also presented for one or more allosteric cembranoid sites which negatively modulate CHEMICALNOTIN affinity for the inhibitory site. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN binding through an allosteric mechanism involving two or more CHEMICALNOTIN sites which display positive cooperativity toward each other. Double inhibitor studies show that the CHEMICALNOTIN inhibitory site and the CHEMICALNOTIN sites are not independent of each other but interfere allosterically with each other's inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN binding. The simplest models consistent with the observed data are presented and discussed.
11587223	CHEMICALIN, a potent suppressor of lymphoma growth by inhibition of the GENEIN: a new action for an old drug. Although CHEMICALNOTIN is nutritionally a CHEMICALNOTIN, lymphoid cells cannot synthesize it, rendering their growth dependent on uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN from their microenvironment. Accordingly, we previously suggested that the GENENOTIN provided a target for lymphoid cancer therapy. Its inhibition could lead to CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency in lymphoma cells via reduction of both their CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and CHEMICALNOTIN supply by somatic cells. In this study, using rat Nb2 lymphoma cultures, drugs were screened for growth arrest based on GENENOTIN- inhibition. CHEMICALIN was fortuitously found to be a novel, potent inhibitor of the GENEIN. It showed high rat lymphoma growth-inhibitory and lytic activity in vitro (IC50 = 0.16 mM), based specifically on inhibition of GENEIN--mediated CHEMICALIN uptake, in contrast to its colonic metabolites, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was even more effective against human non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (DoHH2) cultures. In rats (n = 13), CHEMICALNOTIN (i.p.) markedly inhibited growth of well-developed, rapidly growing rat Nb2 lymphoma transplants without apparent side-effects. Reduced, macrophage-mediated supply of CHEMICALNOTIN was probably involved. In five rats, 90-100% tumor growth suppression, relative to controls, was obtained. The GENEIN represents a novel target for CHEMICALIN-like drugs with high potential for application in therapy of lymphoblastic and other malignancies dependent on extracellular CHEMICALIN.
11588409	Advances in antihypertensive combination therapy: benefits of low-dose CHEMICALNOTIN diuretics in conjunction with CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor. The preferred initial agents for the treatment of high blood pressure are low-dose CHEMICALNOTIN diuretics, beta blockers, CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors. In high-risk patients, including those with diabetes, renal insufficiency, left ventricular dysfunction, and atherosclerosis, GENENOTIN inhibitors may have specific benefit in reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. CHEMICALIN, the prototypical GENEIN inhibitor, inhibits not only GENEIN but also GENEIN. Like conventional GENEIN inhibitors, CHEMICALIN causes extracellular volume reduction and vasodilatation; moreover, it increases levels of GENEIN and GENEIN. Effective blood pressure control, especially in the high-risk patient, usually necessitates combination therapy. A recent study randomized 274 subjects with mild to severe hypertension (stages 1-3 diastolic blood pressure elevation) and confirmed the benefits of CHEMICALNOTIN combined with CHEMICALNOTIN in patients not controlled on CHEMICALNOTIN alone. The frequencies of adverse events, serious adverse events, and discontinuation attributed to adverse events were similar for CHEMICALNOTIN and placebo. Furthermore, there were no clinically significant changes in serum CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or other laboratory parameters. Adding CHEMICALNOTIN to the background of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment produced statistically significant additional reductions in trough diastolic and systolic blood pressures at weeks 4 and 8.
11688549	Neonatal red blood cells: CHEMICALNOTIN-insensitive CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN transport isoform would express CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN exchange. Neonatal red cells (umbilical cord blood) were in vitro incubated in isotonic media (CHEMICALNOTIN as predominant anion). This experimental condition was selected as it was known that this chaotropic anion induced activation of CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN exchange. The transport CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive mechanism, that decreased the acidic intracellular pH change occurring in this medium, would correspond to CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN exchange (GENEIN isoform). However, the CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN exchange, also determined in the cells in the above-mentioned medium was not affected by CHEMICALNOTIN. The present data suggest that an CHEMICALNOTIN insensitive CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN exchange isoform would express CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN countertransport in these cells.
11689471	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN bind to GENEIN (GENENOTIN) and inhibit its GENEIN activity in human fibroblasts. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), an endogenous signaling molecule of plants, possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-neoplastic actions in human. Its derivative, aspirin, is the most commonly used anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) have been reported to have multiple pharmacological actions. However, it is unclear whether they bind to a cellular protein. Here, we report for the first time the purification from human fibroblasts of a approximately 78 kDa GENENOTIN with sequence identity to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The Kd values of CHEMICALIN binding to crude extract and to recombinant GENEIN were 45.2 and 54.6 microM, respectively. GENENOTIN is a GENENOTIN containing a polypeptide binding site recognizing specific GENENOTIN and an GENENOTIN. A heptapeptide with the specific sequence displaced CHEMICALNOTIN binding in a concentration-dependent manner whereas a control heptapeptide did not. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN activity stimulated by this specific heptapeptide but did not block CHEMICALIN binding or induce GENEIN expression. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN bind specifically to the polypeptide binding site of GENEIN in human cells that may interfere with folding and transport of proteins important in inflammation.
11691635	Compensatory changes in enzymes of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism during renal hypertrophy in mice. The present study investigates enzyme activities of the urea cycle, GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN inter-conversion in the hypertrophied kidney after unilateral nephrectomy in mice. Surgical removal of the left kidney in mice led to compensatory enlargement of the right kidney after 1 and 14 days. This renal growth was associated with an increase in glomerular volume (but not number) and enlargement of the proximal convoluted tubules. The total renal protein content increased in proportion to the increase in kidney weight, but the protein per gram weight of kidney did not change. The specific activity of only GENEIN (GENEIN), the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN, increased in 2 weeks of hypertrophy. The specific activity of all other enzymes was unchanged. However, the total enzyme activity per kidney of all the enzymes, without exception, was elevated in the hypertrophied kidney. While the increase in total GENENOTIN activity was much more than the increase in kidney weight, all other enzymes increased more or less in proportion to the increase in renal mass. The results suggest that compensation in GENENOTIN activity to chronic reduction in renal mass was complete, but only partial in the case of other enzymes.
11695255	Analgesia and GENENOTIN inhibition. While non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the mainstay of therapy for the management of acute pain and rheumatoid arthritis, toxicity associated with chronic administration limits their benefit-to-risk relationship in many patients. A series of studies is reviewed that assesses the relationship between GENENOTIN released at the site of tissue injury and NSAID analgesia, and the in vivo selectivity of a selective GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) in comparison to a dual GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN). Three replicate studies in the oral surgery model of acute pain used submucosal microdialysis sample collection for the measurement of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; a product of both GENEIN and GENEIN) and CHEMICALIN (as a biomarker for GENEIN activity) with parallel assessments of pain. The time course of CHEMICALIN production was consistent with early release due to GENEIN activity followed by increased production 2-3 hours after surgery, consistent with GENEIN expression. CHEMICALNOTIN 30 mg at pain onset suppressed both pain and peripheral CHEMICALNOTIN levels. CHEMICALNOTIN 1 mg either at the site of injury or intramuscularly also produced analgesia but without any effect on peripheral CHEMICALNOTIN levels. CHEMICALIN selectively suppressed CHEMICALIN but not CHEMICALIN at time points consistent with GENEIN activity, while producing analgesia. These studies demonstrate the ability to assess the time course and selective effects of GENENOTIN inhibitors in vivo and suggest that suppression of GENEIN mediated CHEMICALIN is temporally related to NSAID analgesia.
11698075	CHEMICALIN binding to GENEIN transfected membranes: a potential high throughput preclinical screen. The pharmacological characteristics of CHEMICALNOTIN binding were examined in membranes prepared from human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing GENENOTIN. The classIII antiarrhythmic compounds CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN all inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN binding. In addition, the structurally unrelated compounds CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, all of which prolong the QT interval in man, also inhibited binding. These data indicate that a CHEMICALIN binding assay using GENEIN membranes may help identify compounds that prolong the QT interval.
11775064	Effects of the antidepressant/antipanic drug CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN in rat brain. 1. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an antidepressant with anxiolytic properties. Acute and chronic CHEMICALIN administration increase brain CHEMICALNOTIN levels, an effect due, at least in part, to an inhibition of the activity of the CHEMICALIN metabolizing enzyme, GENEIN (GENEIN). 2. Previous preliminary reports have indicated that acute CHEMICALNOTIN treatment also elevates brain CHEMICALNOTIN levels. As with CHEMICALNOTIN, the metabolism of CHEMICALIN involves a GENEIN. 3. In the study reported here, the effects of acute CHEMICALNOTIN treatment on the levels of various CHEMICALIN, some of which are also metabolized by GENEIN were compared in rat whole brain. Of the 6 CHEMICALNOTIN investigated, only CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels were elevated (in a time- and dose-dependent manner). 4. The elevation in brain CHEMICALIN levels could be explained, at least in part, by a time- and dose-dependent inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN (GENEIN), although as with CHEMICALNOTIN the increases are higher than expected from the degree of enzyme inhibition produced. In addition, we also showed that the elevation in CHEMICALIN levels and the inhibition of GENEIN in the brain are retained after 14 days of CHEMICALIN treatment, and that CHEMICALNOTIN produces a marked increase in extracellular levels of CHEMICALNOTIN. 5. These results are discussed in terms of their relevance to synaptic function and to the pharmacological profile of CHEMICALNOTIN.
11811354	CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contraction in the rat coronary artery: possible involvement of the endothelium, reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species and GENENOTIN metabolites. CHEMICALNOTIN caused a contraction of the rat coronary artery in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN, and did not in the absence of these agents. The present experiments were undertaken to pharmacologically characterize the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contraction in ring preparations of the rat coronary artery. The contraction was abolished by chemical removal of endothelium CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN radical scavengers, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, significantly attenuated the contraction. GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) attenuated the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contraction in a concentration-dependent manner, and GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors at high concentrations (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) slightly attenuated the contraction. A GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) attenuated the contraction to a small extent only at high concentrations. A GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN) attenuated the contraction in a concentration-dependent manner. A GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN) attenuated the contraction in part and an GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN) nearly abolished the contraction. From these results, it was suggested that the contraction induced by CHEMICALNOTIN in the rat coronary artery in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN is endothelium dependent, and involves reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species and endothelial GENENOTIN metabolites of CHEMICALNOTIN. Part of the contraction is probably due to release of CHEMICALNOTIN.
11858481	Efficacy and safety of the factor VIII/von Willebrand factor concentrate, haemate-P/humate-P: ristocetin cofactor unit dosing in patients with von Willebrand disease. The present study was initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Haemate-P (Humate-P in North America) (anti-hemophilic FVIII/VWF complex [human] dried, pasteurized) dosed in ristocetin cofactor units (VWF:RCo) in the treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD) patients in Canada. This retrospective data collection reviewed the medical records of VWD patients treated under the Canadian Emergency Drug Release Program from November 22, 1991, to April 30, 1996. Data collection was accomplished by on-site retrieval from source data for 97 patients. Dosing was based on the German package insert, which lists only Factor VIII:C (FVIII:C) units, which were converted in the study analysis to VWF:RCo units based on the analysis of the individual manufactured lots of product used in these patients (average ratio of 2.6 IU VWF:RCo per IU FVIII:C). Twenty five different lots of Haemate-P/Humate-P were used to treat 437 different events in the 97 study patients (344 hemorrhagic events, 73 surgical interventions and 20 prophylactic infusion cycles). Overall, the median dose of concentrate per infusion used to treat surgical events was 69.1 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 11.9-222.8); bleeding events 55.3 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 17.1-227.5) and prophylaxis 41.6 IU VWF:RCo/kg (range 34.6-81.0). Treatment periods varied, with the majority of events treated for < or = 10 days (91%). Fifty percent of events that were treated longer than 10 days were given for prophylactic reasons. Efficacy was determined in a standardized manner by the physician, based on dosing in VWF:RCo activity. An overall clinical result of "excellent" or "good" was reported in 97% (424/437) of treatment events. A pediatric sub-population analysis of the patient population reported "excellent/good" efficacy in 100% (17/17) of treatment events in infants, 95% (155/164) in children, and 94% (76/81) in adolescent patients. Related adverse events (AEs) were observed in only 4 (4%) patients and were not deemed to be serious. The findings in this study confirm the safety and efficacy of Haemate-P/Humate-P using VWF:RCo dosing in pediatric and adult patients with various types of VWD.
11885959	Differential binding mode of diverse GENENOTIN inhibitors. Non-CHEMICALIN anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are competitive inhibitors of GENEIN (GENEIN), the enzyme that mediates biosynthesis of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN from CHEMICALIN. There are at least two different isoforms of the enzyme known as GENENOTIN. Site directed mutagenesis studies suggest that non-selective GENENOTIN inhibitors of diverse chemical families exhibit differential binding modes to the two isozymes. These results cannot clearly be explained from the sole analysis of the crystal structures of GENENOTIN available from X-ray diffraction studies. With the aim to elucidate the structural features governing the differential inhibitory binding behavior of these inhibitors, molecular modeling studies were undertaken to generate atomic models compatible with the experimental data available. Accordingly, docking of different GENEIN inhibitors, including selective and non-selective ligands: CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were undertaken using the AMBER program. The results of the present study provide new insights into a better understanding of the differential binding mode of diverse families of GENENOTIN inhibitors, and are expected to contribute to the design of new selective compounds.
11922402	Pure antiestrogens and breast cancer. CHEMICALNOTIN, which is the most commonly used drug for treatment of breast cancer, has both CHEMICALNOTIN agonist and antagonist actions. Pure antiestrogens are devoid of any CHEMICALNOTIN agonist effects. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN are competitive inhibitors of CHEMICALIN by binding to the GENEIN (GENEIN). Preclinical and clinical studies show that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN in inhibiting the growth of breast cancer cells. They are devoid of any CHEMICALNOTIN-agonist action on the uterus and vagina but lack the beneficial effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the bone and serum lipid profile. CHEMICALNOTIN is the first pure CHEMICALNOTIN to complete phase III clinical trials. Such studies have shown that CHEMICALNOTIN is at least as good as CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of post-menopausal women with advanced breast cancer who had relapsed or progressed on prior endocrine therapy. The drug was well tolerated and only minor side-effects were reported. Its potential role in the adjuvant setting will be determined by its adverse effects on bone mass and serum lipids. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are the most potent pure antiestrogens and CHEMICALIN has the highest affinity of all antiestrogens to GENEIN. They have no stimulatory effects on the uterus or vagina. It seems reasonable to expect that pure antiestrogens will be good alternatives to CHEMICALNOTIN and aromatase inhibitors in the treatment of breast cancer.
12016548	Hepatotoxicity of commonly used drugs: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antihypertensives, antidiabetic agents, anticonvulsants, lipid-lowering agents, psychotropic drugs. Hepatotoxic adverse drug reactions have contributed to the decline of many promising therapies, even among mainstream medication classes (bromfenac and troglitazone are recent examples). The spectrum of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-related liver toxicity continues to expand, with reports in children, interactive toxicity in persons with hepatitis C, and recognition of the toxicity of both the preferential and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. Of the antihypertensive agents, methyldopa is now rarely prescribed and adverse effects are reported infrequently, whereas cases of liver injury associated with the angiotensin receptor and converting enzyme inhibitors are increasingly reported. Of the antidiabetic agents, acarbose, gliclazide, metformin, and human insulin have been implicated in causing liver injury. To date, the newer thiazolidinediones do not appear to share the hepatotoxic potential of troglitazone, although a few reports of acute hepatitis have accrued. Although liver injury has been associated with the "statins," the frequency of such toxicity is lower than that of the background population and the value of biochemical monitoring remains unproved. Newer concepts in anticonvulsant hepatotoxicity have been the recognition of the reactive metabolite syndrome, delineation of the risk factors for valproic acid toxicity, the potential role of carnitine in preventing valproic acid hepatotoxicity, and the toxicity of second-line antiepileptic drugs. Liver injury associated with newer psychotropic agents, particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, is also discussed. The focus of the review is the hepatotoxicity of commonly used drugs with particular reference to recent and novel reports of toxicity. Well-known causes of liver injury such as chlorpromazine, phenytoin, and methyldopa are not discussed.
12046981	Pharmacological, pharmacokinetic and clinical properties of CHEMICALNOTIN, a new antiallergic drug. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is a novel antiallergic/GENEIN antagonistic drug that was synthesized and evaluated in our laboratories. Oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN at doses of 0.03 mg/kg or higher inhibited the symptoms of experimental allergic skin responses, rhinoconjunctivitis and bronchial asthma in sensitized guinea pigs and rats. CHEMICALIN is a selective GENEIN antagonist possessing inhibitory effects on the release of inflammatory lipid mediators such as CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes and eosinophils. CHEMICALNOTIN also inhibited the tachykininergic contraction in the guinea pig bronchi by prejunctional inhibition of peripheral sensory nerves. CHEMICALIN exerted no significant effects on action potential duration in isolated guinea pig ventricular myocytes, myocardium and GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was highly and rapidly absorbed in healthy human volunteers. The urinary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN accounted for not less than 58% and the contribution of metabolism was considerably low in the clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN in humans. CHEMICALNOTIN is one of the few renal clearance drugs in antiallergic drugs. CHEMICALNOTIN was shown to be useful for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and chronic urticaria in double-blind clinical trials. CHEMICALNOTIN was approved in Japan for the treatment of allergic rhinitis, chronic urticaria, eczema dermatitis, prurigo, pruritus cutaneous, psoriasis vulgaris and erythema exsudativum multiforme in December, 2000. Ophthalmic solution of CHEMICALNOTIN was also approved in the United States for the treatment of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis in December, 1996 (Appendix: also in the European Union, it was approved in February 2002).
12057823	GENENOTIN polymorphisms and measures of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking among African-American CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent individuals. Considerable evidence indicates that serotonergic mechanisms, particularly the GENEIN (GENEIN), may mediate central effects of CHEMICALIN and may also be involved in impulsive and aggressive behavior. We investigated whether polymorphisms in the GENENOTIN gene were related to traits of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and aggression among CHEMICALNOTIN abusers. Standardized measures of these personality traits were obtained in a sample of 105 severely affected CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent African-American subjects and 44 African-American controls. Two polymorphisms of the GENENOTIN gene were examined involving the 5' promoter (GENENOTIN) region and a 17 base pair GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) marker among CHEMICALNOTIN patients. No significant relationships were observed between polymorphic variants of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN regions and scores on any of the trait measures. Similarly, demographic variables and measures of severity of substance use and depression were unrelated to allele frequencies or genotype distributions of the variants among CHEMICALNOTIN patients. As expected, CHEMICALNOTIN patients scored significantly higher on total scores of impulsivity, aggression, and sensation seeking compared to controls. The findings do not seem to support an association between these polymorphisms in the GENENOTIN gene and impulsive-aggressive traits among CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent African-American individuals.
12070353	A molecular mechanism of action of CHEMICALIN: Induction of GENEIN activity to decrease inflammatory gene expression. The molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of CHEMICALNOTIN is currently unknown, but low-dose CHEMICALNOTIN is an effective add-on therapy to corticosteroids in controlling asthma. CHEMICALIN act, at least in part, by recruitment of GENEIN (GENEIN) to the site of active inflammatory gene transcription. They thereby inhibit the acetylation of core histones that is necessary for inflammatory gene transcription. We show both in vitro and in vivo that low-dose CHEMICALIN enhances GENEIN activity in epithelial cells and macrophages. This increased GENEIN activity is then available for CHEMICALIN recruitment and predicts a cooperative interaction between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. This mechanism occurs at therapeutic concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN and is dissociated from GENENOTIN inhibition (the mechanism of bronchodilation) or the blockade of GENENOTIN, which are partially responsible for its side effects. Thus we have shown that low-dose CHEMICALIN exerts an anti-asthma effect through increasing activation of GENEIN which is subsequently recruited by CHEMICALIN to suppress inflammatory genes.
12085361	Interactions of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN with organic anion uptake systems of human liver. The antibiotics CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN substantially reduce CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) elimination in humans. In rats, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were shown to interfere with hepatic organic anion uptake by inhibition of the GENEIN GENEIN and GENEIN. Therefore, we investigated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the GENENOTIN of human liver and determined whether CHEMICALNOTIN is a substrate of 1 or several of these carriers. In complementary RNA (cRNA)-injected Xenopus laevis oocytes, CHEMICALIN (10 micromol/L) cis-inhibited GENEIN (GENEIN) (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN) (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN) (GENEIN), and GENEIN (GENEIN) (GENEIN) mediated BSP uptake by 69%, 79%, 89%, and 57%, respectively, as compared with uptake into control oocytes. In the presence of 100 micromol/L CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN uptake was almost completely abolished. Approximate K(i) values were 2 micromol/L for GENENOTIN, 3 micromol/L for GENENOTIN, 3 micromol/L for GENENOTIN and 11 micromol/L for GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (10 micromol/L) inhibited GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake by 50%, whereas inhibition of GENEIN-, GENEIN-, and GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN transport was below 15%. 100 micromol/L CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN- and GENEIN-, GENEIN- and GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake by 66%, 96%, 25%, and 49%, respectively. The corresponding K(i) values were 17 micromol/L for GENENOTIN, 5 micromol/L for GENENOTIN, and 51 micromol/L for GENENOTIN. Direct transport of CHEMICALIN could be shown for GENEIN (apparent K(m) value 13 micromol/L) and GENEIN (2.3 micromol/L). In conclusion, these results show that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN interact with GENEIN-mediated substrate transport to different extents. Inhibition of GENEIN can explain the previously observed effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN on hepatic organic anion elimination.
12086935	CHEMICALIN increases GENEIN activity in skeletal muscle of subjects with type 2 diabetes. CHEMICALNOTIN is an effective hypoglycemic drug that lowers blood CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations by decreasing hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN production and increasing CHEMICALNOTIN disposal in skeletal muscle; however, the molecular site of CHEMICALNOTIN action is not well understood. GENEIN (GENEIN) activity increases in response to depletion of cellular energy stores, and this enzyme has been implicated in the stimulation of CHEMICALIN uptake into skeletal muscle and the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis. We recently reported that GENEIN is activated by CHEMICALIN in cultured rat hepatocytes, mediating the inhibitory effects of the drug on hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN production. In the present study, we evaluated whether therapeutic doses of CHEMICALIN increase GENEIN activity in vivo in subjects with type 2 diabetes. CHEMICALIN treatment for 10 weeks significantly increased GENEIN activity in the skeletal muscle, and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of GENEIN on Thr172 and decreased GENEIN activity. The increase in GENEIN activity was likely due to a change in muscle energy status because CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN concentrations were lower after CHEMICALIN treatment. CHEMICALIN-induced increases in GENEIN activity were associated with higher rates of CHEMICALNOTIN disposal and muscle glycogen concentrations. These findings suggest that the metabolic effects of metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be mediated by the activation of GENENOTIN.
12105857	CHEMICALIN prevents CHEMICALNOTIN liver injury in rats through suppression of Kupffer cell sensitization and GENEIN production. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Sensitization of Kupffer cells (KCs) to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and overproduction of GENEIN are critical for progression of CHEMICALIN liver injury. CHEMICALIN has been shown to suppress GENEIN production from macrophages. Accordingly, the purpose of this study was to determine whether CHEMICALNOTIN could prevent CHEMICALNOTIN-induced liver injury. METHODS: Rats were given CHEMICALNOTIN (5 g/kg body wt) and CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg/kg) once every 24 hours intragastrically. To assess the sensitization of Kupffer cells, LPS (5 mg/kg intravenously) was administered and liver histology was evaluated 24 hours later. KCs were isolated after 4 weeks of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment and intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN ([CHEMICALNOTIN]i) was measured using fura-2, whereas GENENOTIN was evaluated by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. GENENOTIN was determined by Western and fluorescence staining. RESULTS: Treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN for 8 weeks caused marked steatosis, necrosis, and inflammation in the liver. These pathologic parameters were diminished markedly by treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN. In the 4-week CHEMICALNOTIN group, the LPS-induced liver damage was aggravated and KCs were sensitized to LPS. Coadministration of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN prevented the KC sensitization completely. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN abolished the LPS-induced increase in GENEIN expression and [CHEMICALNOTIN]i elevation in KCs. Gut permeability was increased about 10-fold after 4 weeks of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure, which was not affected by CHEMICALNOTIN. Moreover, CHEMICALIN reduced the LPS-induced GENEIN production by KCs by decreasing GENEIN messenger RNA. CONCLUSIONS: These results collectively indicate that CHEMICALIN prevents alcoholic liver injury through suppression of GENEIN production and abolishment of KC sensitization.
12141946	Identification and characterization of a novel CHEMICALIN-containing GENEIN of mammalian cell origin. During CHEMICALIN catabolism, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are first acetylated by GENEIN (GENEIN) and subsequently oxidized by GENEIN (GENEIN) to produce CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, respectively. In attempting to clone the GENENOTIN involved in this back-conversion pathway, we encountered an GENENOTIN that preferentially cleaves CHEMICALIN in the absence of prior acetylation by GENEIN. A BLAST search using GENEIN sequences identified homologous mammalian cDNAs derived from human hepatoma and mouse mammary carcinoma: the encoded proteins differed by 20 CHEMICALIN. When either cDNA was transiently transfected into HEK-293 cells, intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN pools decreased by 75% while CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN pools increased, suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN was selectively and directly oxidized by the enzyme. Substrate specificity using lysates of GENENOTIN-transfected HEK-293 cells revealed that the newly identified GENEIN strongly favoured CHEMICALIN over CHEMICALIN and that it failed to act on CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN or the preferred GENEIN substrate, CHEMICALIN. The GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, only partially blocked oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN while a previously reported GENEIN substrate, CHEMICALIN, potently inhibited the reaction. Overall, the data indicate that the enzyme represents a novel GENENOTIN which, on the basis of substrate specificity, we have designated GENENOTIN in order to distinguish it from the GENENOTIN involved in CHEMICALNOTIN back-conversion. The identification of an enzyme capable of directly oxidizing CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN has important implications for understanding polyamine homoeostasis and for interpreting metabolic and cellular responses to clinically relevant CHEMICALNOTIN analogues and inhibitors.
12165285	Low incidence of paradoxical platelet activation by GENENOTIN inhibitors. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) polymorphism has been proposed to influence the inhibitory actions of abciximab. Thus, we hypothesized that this polymorphism might also be the cause for paradoxical activation of platelets by GENENOTIN inhibitors. The effects of abciximab (1-10 microg/ml), CHEMICALNOTIN (3-30 nM), or CHEMICALNOTIN (0.3-3 microg/ml) on basal and CHEMICALNOTIN (3 microM)-induced GENENOTIN externalization were measured in n=62 healthy blood donors and n=177 patients with stable coronary artery disease. All subjects were genotyped for the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) polymorphism by GALIOS(R) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. Although a significant platelet hyperreactivity was observed in the patients, the GENENOTIN genotype did not influence basal or CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN expression. A moderate (twofold) stimulation of GENEIN expression by abciximab but not by CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN was observed in one patient. Interestingly, this patient carried the GENENOTIN b/b genotype. In no other subject any activation of platelets by GENENOTIN inhibitors was observed and there were no statistically significant differences between GENENOTIN genotypes with respect to the effects of GENENOTIN inhibitors on basal or CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN expression. It is concluded that paradoxical platelet activation by abciximab is a rare (<2%) phenomenon. GENENOTIN b/b genotype might be a contributing factor but clearly does not predict platelet activation by GENENOTIN inhibitors.
12167474	Toxic, halogenated CHEMICALNOTIN and targeting of mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. Several CHEMICALNOTIN are metabolized in part to nephrotoxic CHEMICALNOTIN; for example, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are converted to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), respectively. Although CHEMICALNOTIN-induced toxicity has been investigated since the 1950s, the toxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN and other CHEMICALNOTIN has been studied more recently. Some segments of the US population are exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN either through drinking water or in the workplace. Therefore, it is important to define the toxicological consequences of such exposures. Most halogenated CHEMICALIN are metabolized by CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN to CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and an CHEMICALIN (with CHEMICALIN) or an CHEMICALIN (with CHEMICALIN) that may eliminate CHEMICALNOTIN to give a CHEMICALNOTIN, which reacts with CHEMICALIN groups of CHEMICALIN residues in proteins. Nine mammalian CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-containing enzymes catalyze CHEMICALNOTIN GENENOTIN reactions, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Most of the CHEMICALNOTIN GENENOTIN are syncatalytically inactivated. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced toxicity is associated with covalent modification of several mitochondrial enzymes of energy metabolism. Interestingly, the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), but not the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), are susceptible to inactivation. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN may form metabolons with GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively, but no GENENOTIN is known to associate with GENENOTIN. Consequently, we hypothesize that not only do these metabolons facilitate substrate channeling, but they also facilitate toxicant channeling, thereby promoting the inactivation of proximate mitochondrial enzymes and the induction of mitochondrial dysfunction.
12175785	A heterozygote phenotype is present in the jvs +/- mutant mouse livers. The juvenile visceral steatosis (jvs) mouse, having a mutation in the CHEMICALIN transporter gene GENEIN, is a model of primary systemic CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency in humans (SCD, OMIM 212140). Like humans with SCD, homozygous jvs -/- mice have hepatic and cardiac steatoses, reduced plasma and tissue CHEMICALNOTIN, and increased urinary CHEMICALNOTIN clearance. Because symptomatic heterozygotes have been reported for some CHEMICALNOTIN oxidation disorders, including SCD, we compared the jvs heterozygotes to normal control mice. We measured the free and esterified CHEMICALNOTIN, total CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN in adult liver samples, myocardium, and skeletal muscle. Our results indicate significant differences between the livers of nonfasting adult normal (n = 8) vs jvs heterozygotes (n = 8) (means +/- SEM, p < 0.01) for the following parameters: free CHEMICALNOTIN, 2.28 +/- 0.36 nmol/mg protein vs 0.41 +/- 0.13; total CHEMICALNOTIN, 3.48 +/- 0.36 vs 1.27 +/- 0.25; CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.14 +/- 0.04 vs 0.39 +/- 0.02; and total CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.21 +/- 0.02 vs 0.39 +/- 0.04, but not for esterified CHEMICALNOTIN, 1.18 +/- 0.17 vs 0.90 +/- 0.17 (p > 0.05). There is also a negative correlation between hepatic free CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN from jvs heterozygotes (p < 0.05). Similar results were obtained with myocardium and skeletal muscle. We conclude that free and total CHEMICALNOTIN levels are significantly lower in the heterozygote mouse liver and heart while CHEMICALNOTIN and total CHEMICALNOTIN levels are significantly higher. We speculate that in situations of lipolytic stress, some SCD heterozygotes might develop clinical symptoms of CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency.
12181285	GENENOTIN mRNA and function in the rat superior cervical ganglion. Reuptake of extracellular CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) into superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurones is mediated by means of the GENEIN (GENEIN, uptake 1). We now demonstrate by single-cell RT-PCR that mRNA of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, uptake 2) occurs in rat SCG neurones as well. Furthermore, our RT-PCR analyses reveal the presence of mRNA for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), but not for GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN in the ganglion. Making use of the GENENOTIN as a powerful, neurone-specific transporter system, we loadedCHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) into cultured rat SCG neurones. The ensuing radioactive outflow from these cultures was enhanced by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, but reduced (in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN) by the GENEIN inhibitors cyanine 863, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. In contrast, cyanine 863 enhanced the radioactive outflow from cultures preloaded with CHEMICALNOTIN. Two observations suggest that a depletion of storage vesicles by cyanine 863 accounts for the latter phenomenon: first, the primary radioactive product isolated from supernatants of cultures loaded with CHEMICALNOTIN was the metabolite CHEMICALNOTIN; and second, inhibition of GENENOTIN significantly reduced the radioactive outflow in response to cyanine 863. The outflow of CHEMICALIN was significantly enhanced by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as potential substrates for GENEIN-related GENEIN. However, CHEMICALNOTIN at a low concentration essentially blocked the radioactive outflow induced by all of these substances with the exception of CHEMICALIN, indicating the GENEIN and not an GENEIN as their primary site of action. The CHEMICALNOTIN-induced release of CHEMICALNOTIN was fully prevented by a combined application of CHEMICALNOTIN and cyanine 863. No trans-stimulation of CHEMICALIN outflow was observed by the GENEIN and GENEIN substrate carnitine at 100 microM. Our observations indicate an GENEIN-mediated transmembrane transport of CHEMICALIN. Amongst the three GENEIN expressed in the SCG, GENEIN best fits the profile of substrates and antagonists that cause trans-stimulation and trans-inhibition, respectively, of CHEMICALIN release.
12200198	Neuroprotection by CHEMICALNOTIN in Parkinson's disease: suppression of apoptosis and induction of prosurvival genes. In Parkinson's disease (PD), therapies to delay or suppress the progression of cell death in nigrostriatal CHEMICALNOTIN neurons have been proposed by use of various agents. An inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), was reported to have neuroprotective activity, but clinical trials failed to confirm it. However, the animal and cellular models of PD proved that CHEMICALNOTIN protects neurons from cell death. Among CHEMICALNOTIN-related CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) was the most effective to suppress the cell death in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In this paper, the mechanism of the neuroprotection by CHEMICALNOTIN was examined using human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells against cell death induced by an endogenous dopaminergic neurotoxin CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN induced apoptosis (but not necrosis) in SH-SY5Y cells, and the apoptotic cascade was initiated by mitochondrial permeability transition (PT) and activated by stepwise reactions. CHEMICALIN prevented the PT in mitochondria directly and also indirectly through induction of antiapoptotic GENEIN and a GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN). Long-term administration of CHEMICALIN to rats increased the activities of antioxidative enzymes GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN in the brain regions containing CHEMICALNOTIN neurons. CHEMICALNOTIN and related CHEMICALNOTIN may rescue degenerating CHEMICALNOTIN neurons through inhibiting death signal transduction initiated by mitochondria PT.
12213119	Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN in calves. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) was administered to six calves intravenously (i.v.) and orally at a dose rate of 4.4 mg/kg in a three-period cross-over study incorporating a placebo treatment to establish its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Extravascular distribution was determined by measuring penetration into tissue chamber fluid in the absence of stimulation (transudate) and after stimulation of chamber tissue with the mild irritant carrageenan (exudate). CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacokinetics after i.v. dosage was characterized by slow clearance (1.29 mL/kg/h), long-terminal half-life (53.4 h), low distribution volume (0.09 L/kg) and low concentrations in plasma of the metabolite CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), confirming previously published data for adult cattle. After oral dosage bioavailability (F) was 66%. Passage into exudate was slow and limited, and penetration into transudate was even slower and more limited; area under curve values for plasma, exudate and transudate after i.v. dosage were 3604, 1117 and 766 microg h/mL and corresponding values after oral dosage were 2435, 647 and 486 microg h/mL. These concentrations were approximately 15-20 (plasma) and nine (exudate) times greater than those previously reported in horses (receiving the same dose rate of CHEMICALNOTIN). In the horse, the lower concentrations had produced marked inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis and suppressed the inflammatory response. The higher concentrations in calves were insufficient to inhibit significantly exudate CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENENOTIN concentrations and exudate leucocyte numbers, serum CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), and GENENOTIN-induced skin swelling. These differences from the horse might be the result of: (a) the presence in equine biological fluids of higher concentrations than in calves of the active CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite, CHEMICALNOTIN; (b) a greater degree of binding of CHEMICALNOTIN to plasma protein in calves; (c) species differences in the sensitivity to CHEMICALIN of the GENEIN (GENEIN) isoenzymes, GENEIN and GENEIN or; (d) a combination of these factors. To achieve clinical efficacy with single doses of CHEMICALNOTIN in calves, higher dosages than 4.4 mg/kg will be probably required.
12227806	Practical asymmetric synthesis of CHEMICALIN, a potent human GENEIN antagonist, via a stereoselective Lewis acid-catalyzed trans acetalization reaction. A streamlined and high-yielding synthesis of CHEMICALIN (1), a potent GENEIN antagonist, is described. The enantiopure CHEMICALNOTIN 16 starting material was synthesized via a novel crystallization-induced dynamic resolution process. Conversion of 16 to the penultimate intermediate CHEMICALNOTIN 9 features a highly stereoselective Lewis acid-catalyzed trans acetalization of CHEMICALNOTIN 3 with CHEMICALNOTIN 18 followed by inversion of the adjacent chiral center on the CHEMICALNOTIN ring. The six-step process for the synthesis of 9 was accomplished in extremely high overall yield (81%) and with only two isolations.
12297509	Signaling through Gi family members in platelets. Redundancy and specificity in the regulation of adenylyl cyclase and other effectors. Platelet responses at sites of vascular injury are regulated by intracellular cAMP levels, which rise rapidly when prostacyclin (PGI(2)) is released from endothelial cells. Platelet agonists such as ADP and epinephrine suppress PGI(2)-stimulated cAMP formation by activating receptors coupled to G(i) family members, four of which are present in platelets. To address questions about the specificity of receptor:G protein coupling, the regulation of cAMP formation in vivo and the contribution of G(i)-mediated pathways that do not involve adenylyl cyclase, we studied platelets from mice that lacked the alpha subunits of one or more of the three most abundantly expressed G(i) family members and compared the results with platelets from mice that lacked the PGI(2) receptor, IP. As reported previously, loss of G(i2)alpha or G(z)alpha inhibited aggregation in response to ADP and epinephrine, respectively, producing defects that could not be reversed by adding an adenylyl cyclase inhibitor. Platelets that lacked both G(i2)alpha and G(z)alpha showed impaired responses to both agonists, but the impairment was no greater than in the individual knockouts. Loss of G(i3)alpha had no effect either alone or in combination with G(z)alpha. Loss of either G(z)alpha or G(i2)alpha impaired the ability of ADP and epinephrine to inhibit PGI(2)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity and caused a 40%-50% rise in basal cAMP levels, whereas loss of G(i3)alpha did not. Conversely, deletion of IP abolished responses to PGI(2) and caused cAMP levels to fall by 30%, effects that did not translate into enhanced responsiveness to agonists ex vivo. From these results we conclude that 1) cAMP levels in circulating platelets reflect ongoing signaling through G(i2), G(z), and IP, but not G(i3); 2) platelet epinephrine (alpha(2A)-adrenergic) and ADP (P2Y12) receptors display strong preferences among G(i) family members with little evidence of redundancy; and 3) these receptor preferences do not extend to G(i3). Finally, the failure of ADP and epinephrine to inhibit basal, as opposed to PGI(2)-stimulated, cAMP formation highlights the need during platelet activation for G(i) signaling pathways that involve effectors other than adenylyl cyclase.
12375053	Effects of pentosan polysulfate CHEMICALNOTIN on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced pituitary prolactinoma in Fischer 344 rats. The development of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced pituitary prolactinoma in Fischer 344 (F344) rats is associated with enhanced neovascularization. This type of tumor is a rich source of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which possesses strong mitogenic and angiogenic properties. Pentosan polysulfate CHEMICALIN (PPS) has been shown to exert antitumor activity by antagonizing the binding of GENEIN to cell surface receptors. We have examined the effects of pentosan on tumor growth, hyperprolactinemia and angiogenesis in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced anterior pituitary adenoma in F344 rats. Chronic treatment with PPS did not cause any changes in the pituitary weight and serum prolactin concentration in comparison with untreated animals. The density of microvessels identified by CD-31 was also not affected by the tested drug. On the other hand, pentosan has been found to decrease cell proliferation evaluated by a number of PCNA-positive stained cell nuclei. Moreover, the TUNEL method has revealed an increased number of apoptotic bodies within the anterior pituitary after treatment with PPS. Despite the antiproliferative and proapoptotic activity of pentosan, the drug failed to inhibit tumor growth. This fact might be due to the lack of antiangiogenic activity of PPS in this experimental design.
12388412	Localization of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in mouse kidney. CHEMICALNOTIN is both produced and transported by renal epithelial cells, and it regulates renal ion transport. Recent studies have identified a family of putative GENENOTIN; mRNA for two members of this family, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), is expressed in the kidney. The purpose of this study was to determine the cellular location of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein in the mouse kidney. We generated GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN-specific anti-peptide antibodies. Immunoblot analysis confirmed that both proteins were expressed in the mouse kidney. GENENOTIN localization with immunohistochemistry revealed discrete basolateral labeling in the connecting segment (CNT) and in the majority of initial collecting tubule (ICT) and cortical collecting duct (CCD) cells. In the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) and inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) only a subpopulation of cells exhibited basolateral immunoreactivity. Colocalization of GENEIN with GENENOTIN, the CHEMICALIN-sensitive transporter, and the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN demonstrated GENENOTIN immunoreactivity in all CNT cells and all CCD and ICT principal cells. In the ICT and CCD, basolateral GENENOTIN immunoreactivity is also present in A-type intercalated cells but not in GENENOTIN-positive CCD intercalated cells. In the OMCD and IMCD, only intercalated cells exhibit GENENOTIN immunoreactivity. Immunoreactivity for a second putative GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, was present in the apical region of cells with almost the same distribution as GENENOTIN. However, GENENOTIN immunoreactivity was present in all CCD cells, and it was present in outer stripe OMCD principal cells, in addition to OMCD and IMCD intercalated cells. Thus the majority of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein expression is present in the same epithelial cell types in the CNT and collecting duct but with opposite polarity. These findings suggest that GENEIN and GENEIN may play important and cell-specific roles in CHEMICALIN transport and signaling in these regions of the kidney.
12414329	GENENOTIN as a pharmacologic target in erectile dysfunction. The scientific rationale of pharmacologically inhibiting GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) is reviewed. Published literature on the CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) pathway for penile erection and on GENENOTIN inhibition using sildenafil as the model for pharmacologic GENENOTIN inhibition are assessed. The key second messenger in the mediation of penile erection is cGMP. GENEIN is the predominant GENEIN in the corpus cavernosum, and CHEMICALIN is its primary substrate. Therefore, in men with ED, elevation of CHEMICALNOTIN in corpus cavernosal tissue via selective inhibition of CHEMICALIN-specific GENEIN is a means of improving erectile function at minimal risk of adverse events. This approach is validated by the clinical efficacy and safety of CHEMICALIN, the pioneering drug for selective GENEIN inhibitor therapy for ED. CHEMICALIN exhibits inhibitory potency against GENEIN and a 10-fold lower dose-related inhibitory potency against rod outer segment GENEIN, the predominant GENEIN in the phototransduction cascade in rods. Thus, its pharmacologic profile is predictable, with close correlation between pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties. Clinically, CHEMICALNOTIN improves erectile function in a large percentage of men with ED. The most common adverse events are due to GENENOTIN inhibition in vascular and visceral smooth muscle; similar adverse events are expected during therapeutic use of all GENENOTIN inhibitors. As free CHEMICALIN plasma concentrations approach concentrations sufficient to inhibit retinal GENEIN, usually at higher therapeutic doses, transient, reversible visual adverse events can occur, albeit infrequently. Selective inhibition of GENEIN is a rational therapeutic approach in ED, as proved by the clinical success of CHEMICALIN.
12421359	Study of the nematode putative GENEIN subunits: evidence for modulation by CHEMICALIN. Two alleles of the GENENOTIN gene, which encodes a putative GENENOTIN subunit, were isolated from Haemonchus contortus. These two alleles were shown previously to be associated with CHEMICALIN susceptibility (GENEIN) and resistance (GENEIN), respectively. Sequence analysis indicates that they differ in four CHEMICALNOTIN. To explore the functional properties of the two alleles, a full-length cDNA encoding the beta subunit, a key functional component of the GENENOTIN, was isolated from Caenorhabditis elegans (GENENOTIN, corresponding to the GENENOTIN) and coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes with the GENENOTIN alleles. When GENENOTIN was coexpressed with either the GENENOTIN allele or the GENENOTIN allele in Xenopus oocytes, GENENOTIN with different sensitivity to the agonist were formed. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the hetero-oligomeric receptors were determined. Application of CHEMICALNOTIN alone had no effect on the receptors. However, when coapplied with 10 micro m CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALIN potentiated the CHEMICALIN-evoked current of the GENEIN/GENEIN receptor, but attenuated the CHEMICALIN response of the GENEIN/GENEIN receptor. We demonstrated that the coexpressed GENEIN and GENEIN receptors are CHEMICALIN-responsive, and provide evidence for the possible involvement of GENEIN in the mechanism of CHEMICALIN resistance.
12438517	CHEMICALIN dimers exhibiting selectivity for the GENEIN subtype. CHEMICALIN is a potent and selective GENEIN antagonist. To date, drugs with high specificity for the GENENOTIN show marginal selectivity among the three GENENOTIN subtypes. Initial studies showed that CHEMICALIN was about 4- and 15-fold more selective for the GENEIN in comparison with the GENENOTIN, respectively. To improve on this GENENOTIN subtype selectivity, a series of CHEMICALNOTIN dimers (varying from n = 2 to 24 spacer atoms) were prepared and evaluated for receptor binding on GENENOTIN subtypes expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Each dimeric analog showed higher affinities for GENENOTIN versus the GENENOTIN; and CHEMICALIN dimers with spacers of n = 2, 3, 4, 18, and 24 exhibited selectivity for the GENEIN. The CHEMICALIN dimers n = 3 and n = 24 showed the highest potency and selectivity (32- and 82-fold. respectively) for the GENEIN in receptor binding and in functional studies (42- and 29-fold, respectively) measuring CHEMICALNOTIN changes using a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay. The dimers (n = 3 and n = 24) had high selectivity (>1000-fold) for the GENENOTIN compared with the three GENENOTIN subtypes. These findings demonstrate that the addition of spacer linkages to bivalent CHEMICALIN molecules provides a successful approach to the development of ligands that are potent and highly selective for the GENEIN.
12470615	Plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce GENEIN and mature in response to the GENEIN agonists, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. The immune response modifiers, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, are GENEIN agonists that induce GENEIN in numerous species, including humans. Recently, it was shown that plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) are the primary GENENOTIN-producing cells in the blood in response to viral infections. Here, we characterize the activation of human pDC with the GENEIN agonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Results indicate that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN induce GENEIN and GENEIN from purified pDC, and pDC are the principle GENEIN-producing cells in the blood. CHEMICALIN-stimulated pDC also produce a number of other GENEIN including GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN enhances co-stimulatory marker expression, GENEIN expression, and pDC viability. CHEMICALNOTIN was compared throughout the study to the pDC survival factors, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN more effectively matures pDC than either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN alone. These results demonstrate that CHEMICALIN molecules directly induce pDC maturation as determined by GENEIN induction, GENEIN and co-stimulatory marker expression and prolonging viability.
12472888	Induction of GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN in cultured astrocytes and reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cell death. Induction of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) protects cells from oxidative injury. Here GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were induced in cultured rat astrocytes, and protection against oxidative stress was investigated. Astrocytes were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (20-50 micro m) for 1 h, which was non-toxic to cells, 24 h later they were exposed to 400 micro m CHEMICALNOTIN for 1 h, and cell death was evaluated at different time points. CHEMICALIN triggered strong induction of GENEIN, which was prevented by 1 micro g/mL CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). CHEMICALIN caused cell loss and increased cell death with features of apoptosis, i.e. TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling (TUNEL) reaction and GENEIN activation. These features were abrogated by pre-treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN, which prevented cell loss and significantly reduced the number of dead cells. The protective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was not detected in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. Pre-treatment with arsenite increased GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) phosphorylation after CHEMICALIN. However, while GENEIN phosphorylation was prevented by CHX, GENENOTIN phosphorylation was further enhanced by CHEMICALIN. The results show that transient CHEMICALIN pre-treatment induces GENEIN, GENEIN and, to a lesser extent, GENEIN; it reduces CHEMICALNOTIN-induced astrocyte death; and it causes selective activation of GENEIN following CHEMICALIN. It is suggested that GENENOTIN expression at the time of CHEMICALIN exposure protects astrocytes from oxidative injury and apoptotic cell death by means of pro-survival GENEIN.
12487427	Investigation of GENEIN metabolism in human and rat plasma in the presence of the dual GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Several studies have suggested that the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN, or that of one its metabolites BK1-8, is involved in the occurrence of side effects such as AE associated with the use of various GENENOTINi. In this work a novel approach combining HPLC-UV on-line with oaTOF-MS and ICPMS was applied to investigate in human and rat plasma the metabolism of labelled CHEMICALNOTIN (GENENOTIN) CHEMICALNOTIN in the presence of two new dual GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitors (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) currently under clinical trial. In human plasma the GENEIN half-life values in the absence or in the presence of CHEMICALIN (3.8 microM) or CHEMICALIN (32 nM) were 38.7 +/- 2.4, 51.2 +/- 4.7 and 114.7 +/- 9.3 min, respectively and CHEMICALNOTIN was degraded into CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. In the presence of inhibitors, however, the levels of these resultant metabolites were different. Unlike CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN abolished the production of GENEIN and GENEIN, suggesting a better GENEIN inhibition effect over CHEMICALIN as no GENEIN activity was found. In addition the production of GENEIN was enhanced in the presence of these inhibitors with a greater accumulation being observed with CHEMICALIN. The production of GENEIN was reduced with CHEMICALIN while no significant change was observed with CHEMICALIN after 4 h of incubation. In rat plasma the GENEIN half-life values in the absence or in the presence of CHEMICALIN (530 nM) or CHEMICALIN (50 nM) were 9.31 +/- 1.7, 22.06 +/- 3.1 and 25.3 +/- 1.7 min, respectively and GENENOTIN was degraded into CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN plus CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites not found in human plasma. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN reduced the production of GENEIN and GENEIN with more effect being observed with CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN increased the production of both GENEIN and GENEIN but not that of GENEIN and GENEIN. This study shows that the potency of CHEMICALIN in comparison with CHEMICALIN is more than 100-fold lower in human, but less than 10-fold lower in rat plasma, suggesting that rat may not be a suitable in vivo model for the evaluation of GENEIN/GENEIN inhibition in relation to effects in humans.
12513698	Activity of opioid ligands in cells expressing cloned mu opioid receptors. BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to describe the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a cell system expressing only mu opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production. Efficacies and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand beta-endorphin and the common mu agonist, morphine. RESULTS: Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44,441 and SKF 10047, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Agonist efficacy was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The rank order of efficacy of the agonists was fentanyl = hydromorphone = beta-endorphin > etorphine = lofentanil = butorphanol = morphine = nalbuphine = nalorphine > cyclazocine = dezocine = metazocine >or= xorphanol. The rank order of potency of these ligands was different from that of their efficacies; etorphine > hydromorphone > dezocine > xorphanol = nalorphine = butorphanol = lofentanil > metazocine > nalbuphine > cyclazocine > fentanyl > morphine >>>> beta-endorphin. CONCLUSION: These results elucidate the relative activities of a set of opioid ligands at mu opioid receptor and can serve as the initial step in a systematic study leading to understanding of the mode of action of opioid ligands at this receptor. Furthermore, these results can assist in understanding the physiological effect of many opioid ligands acting through mu opioid receptors.
12604879	Ventricular tachyarrhythmias in a canine model of LQT3: arrhythmogenic effects of sympathetic activity and therapeutic effects of mexiletine. The ventricular tachyarrhythmias associated with the LQT3 syndrome are typically bradycardia-dependent. However, some episodes can be associated with exercise or emotional stress, suggesting a different arrhythmogenic mechanism when sympathetic activity predominates. This study examined the potential arrhythmogenic mechanisms during periods of autonomically mediated transient heart rate acceleration in a canine anthopleurin-A model of LQT3 syndrome. Using plunge needle electrodes, transmural unipolar electrograms of the left ventricle were recorded from endocardial (Endo), mid-myocardial (Mid) and epicardial (Epi) sites. The activation-recovery interval (ARI) was measured to estimate local refractoriness. The cardiac cycle length was gradually shortened by cessation of vagal stimulation (vagal stimulation protocol (VSP)), and intramural electrograms and onset mode of ventricular tachyarrhythmias were analyzed in 7 experiments. The VSP was performed 8 times before and 5 times after administration of mexiletine in each experiment. Before mexiletine, vagal stimulation slowed the heart rate and created large transmural ARI dispersion because of a greater ARI prolongation at Mid rather than Epi/Endo sites. After cessation of vagal stimulation, unipolar electrograms started to show ARI alternans and ventricular premature beats developed sporadically. Sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias were induced in 12 of the 56 trials of the VSP. Initiation of ventricular tachyarrhythmias was associated with delayed conduction at Mid/Endo sites. Mexiletine attenuated transmural ARI dispersion, and neither ARI alternans nor ventricular tachyarrhythmias was observed during all 35 trials of the VSP after mexiletine administration. Heart rate acceleration induced by an abrupt shift to a state of predominant sympathetic activity enhances arrhythmias in this LQT3 model. Mexiletine homogenizes ventricular repolarization, suppresses premature complexes and was antiarrhythmic during ventricular tachyarrhythmias induced by the VSP.
12636181	GENENOTIN: an important new target in Alzheimer's disease therapy. GENEIN (GENEIN) predominates in the healthy brain, with GENEIN (GENEIN) considered to play a minor role in regulating brain CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) levels. However, GENENOTIN activity progressively increases in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while GENENOTIN activity remains unchanged or declines. Both enzymes therefore represent legitimate therapeutic targets for ameliorating the cholinergic deficit considered to be responsible for the declines in cognitive, behavioral and global functioning characteristic of AD. The two enzymes differ in substrate specificity, kinetics and activity in different brain regions. Experimental evidence from the use of agents with enhanced selectivity for GENEIN (CHEMICALIN analogues, CHEMICALIN) and the dual inhibitor of both GENEIN and GENEIN, CHEMICALIN, indicates potential therapeutic benefits of inhibiting both GENEIN and GENEIN in AD and related dementias. Recent evidence suggests that both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN may have roles in the aetiology and progression of AD beyond regulation of synaptic ACh levels. The development of specific GENEIN inhibitors and further experience with the dual enzyme inhibitor CHEMICALIN will improve understanding of the aetiology of AD and should lead to a wider variety of potent treatment options.
12710892	A low toxicity maintenance regime, using CHEMICALIN and readily available drugs, for mantle cell lymphoma and other malignancies with excess GENEIN levels. Mantle cell lymphoma is a difficult to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) whose biochemistry is unusually well characterised. Almost all and perhaps all patients overexpress the GENENOTIN protein which is crucial in driving cells from the G1 to the S phase. This overexpression may be responsible for the refractoriness. Despite this understanding, treatments for mantle cell lymphoma are based on standard NHL regimes of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, perhaps supplemented with the monoclonal antibody rituximab. There has never been any attempt to direct treatment to the GENENOTIN mechanism or to angiogenesis which is now known to be important in all lymphomas. Both these targets lend themselves to long-term maintenance regimes of relatively low toxicity which can be used as adjuvants to standard therapy. Agents which have recently been shown to block GENEIN translation by regulating calcium levels are the CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), the antidiabetic CHEMICALIN, and the antifungal agent, CHEMICALIN. Two types of agent which have been shown to inhibit angiogenesis are the teratogen, CHEMICALNOTIN, and the selective inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN exert synergistic effects with CHEMICALNOTIN and have been shown to inhibit both tumour growth and angiogenesis. The mechanisms of action of these various agents are discussed, and specific suggestions are made for low toxicity maintenance therapy of mantle cell lymphoma and of other tumours which overexpress GENENOTIN.
12719755	GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN and the defence reaction in the anaesthetised rat. Effect on the carotid chemoreflex. Modulation at the level of the nucleus tractus solitarii (NTS) appears to be an effective way of controlling cardiovascular reflexes. CHEMICALIN acting on GENEIN at the central nervous system appears to have an important role in these modulatory processes. The hypothalamic defence area (HDA) is a potential source of descending fibres containing CHEMICALNOTIN that innervate the NTS. We investigated the effect of GENEIN blockade in the NTS on the response to stimulation of HDA in anaesthetised rats treated with the neuromuscular blocking agent CHEMICALIN. The characteristic increase in heart rate, blood pressure and phrenic nerve activity evoked by electrical stimulation of HDA is decreased by the microinjection of the GENENOTIN antagonist losartan into the NTS and the cardiovascular response to carotid body chemical stimulation is also reduced. These results support the hypothesis that GENENOTIN in the NTS play a role in the modulation of cardiovascular reflexes, and modify the influence exerted on the processing of these reflexes by other areas of the central nervous system.
12720300	Defective processing of the GENEIN in CHEMICALIN-induced mouse colon tumors. High levels of the cell growth inhibitor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are often found in a variety of human cancers. However, the physiological significance of this overexpression depends on the availability of the biologically active form of GENENOTIN within the extracellular matrix of the tumor microenvironment. To determine the expression and activation status of GENENOTIN in chemically induced tumors, 6-wk-old A/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with either CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) (10 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 6 wk) or normal saline solution, and colon tumors were isolated 24 wk following the last injection. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for GENENOTIN revealed a significant increase (1.7-fold, P < 0.05) in total GENENOTIN protein in tumors. Interestingly, while 80% of the total GENENOTIN in the control colon tissues was in the active form, only 50% was found to be active in tumors. Together with our earlier observations that GENENOTIN mRNA levels are unchanged in A/J tumors, these data further support a mechanism whereby elevated GENENOTIN levels result from a defective activation and turnover of this protein. Because GENENOTIN is known to be a major activator of GENENOTIN in vivo, we hypothesized that reduced GENENOTIN activity may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of GENENOTIN processing in these behaviorally benign tumors. With a fluorogenic peptide substrate for GENENOTIN, a deficiency in GENENOTIN activity was found in the tumors. Furthermore, semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a panel of genes involved in the GENENOTIN activation system, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), demonstrated a significant upregulation (approximately fourfold to sixfold, P < 0.05) in the expression of each of these genes in the tumor tissue. In addition, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which also mediate the activation of latent GENENOTIN. To gain further insight into the functionality of the GENENOTIN pathway, cDNA microarrays were performed and the expression levels of a panel of 21 GENENOTIN-specific target genes were determined in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced tumors that overexpress the ligand. A significant dysregulation in the expression of each of these targets was observed, providing evidence of aberrant GENENOTIN signaling in tumors. Overall, the present study demonstrates a very low GENENOTIN activity in A/J colon tumors, possibly as a result of the potent inhibitory effect of GENENOTIN on the GENENOTIN activation cascade. The observed deficiency in GENENOTIN activity may not be sufficiently compensated for by other mechanisms of latent GENENOTIN activation, including GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, thereby resulting in a decreased fraction of the biologically active form of GENENOTIN and subsequent aberration in GENENOTIN-specific gene regulation in A/J tumors.
1279186	Inhibition by pentosan polysulfate (PPS) of heparin-binding growth factors released from tumor cells and blockage by PPS of tumor growth in animals. BACKGROUND: In a proliferating tumor, locally secreted polypeptide growth factors, which have autocrine and paracrine functions, induce vascularization essential for tumor growth and metastasis. These growth factors may serve as targets for tumor therapy. We have shown that the heparinoid pentosan polysulfate (PPS) can block growth of subcutaneous human tumor xenografts in nude mice and angiogenesis induced by the heparin-binding, Kaposi's sarcoma-derived fibroblast growth factor (K-FGF). PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine whether PPS might also interfere with stimulation of endothelial cells by other growth factors released from tumor cells and whether the promising antitumor effects of PPS extend to other human tumor cell lines. We studied the effects of PPS on stimulation by heparin-binding growth factors released from seven human tumor cell lines in vitro and on tumors growing from these cell lines in athymic nude mice. METHODS: Seven human cell lines established from breast, prostate, epidermoid, and lung carcinomas and rhabdomyosarcoma were used in in vivo as well as in vitro studies of the effects of PPS. We also studied in vitro the effects of PPS on growth factor-induced colony formation of normal rat kidney fibroblasts and human adrenal carcinoma cells. RESULTS: The tumor cell lines released growth factors into their media that stimulated growth of endothelial and epithelial cells as well as fibroblasts. Heparin-affinity chromatography showed that heparin-binding growth factors contributed substantially to this paracrine activity and that PPS inhibited this stimulus. Six of the seven tumor cell lines were resistant to PPS in soft-agar cloning assays and hence did not appear to depend on autocrine stimulation by the heparin-binding growth factors. In contrast to this in vitro resistance, subcutaneous growth of tumors from all cell lines in athymic nude mice was inhibited in a dose-dependent fashion by daily intraperitoneal injections of PPS. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that heparin-binding growth factors contribute substantially to tumor growth in vivo and that PPS acts by blocking the paracrine effects of heparin-binding growth factors released from the tumor cells. IMPLICATION: PPS could become a novel treatment tool targeting tumor growth factors.
12842269	Binding and CHEMICALIN autoradiographic analysis of GENEIN products at the GENEIN and GENEIN. Utilizing agonist-stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN autoradiography, we analyzed the ability of GENENOTIN to stimulate CHEMICALNOTIN binding in adult rat brain. GENEIN (GENEIN) stimulated CHEMICALIN binding in a pattern similar to that described for [CHEMICALIN]-GENEIN at the endogenous GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN peptides nocistatin and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) had no effect, suggesting that they do not mediate their reported analgesic effects via a GENENOTIN (i.e. opioid or GENENOTIN). Unlike GENEIN, high concentrations of its CHEMICALIN-terminal extension, GENEIN, stimulated CHEMICALIN binding in a GENEIN-like distribution and the effect was blocked by CHEMICALIN. To explore these observations, we evaluated the receptor binding profile of GENENOTIN at the cloned GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN had no specific binding at either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN at concentrations up to 50 microM. This lack of affinity was not consistent with a mu-mediated effect, as suggested by preliminary observation using functional autoradiography in rat brain sections. Although behavioral studies suggest that GENENOTIN possesses analgesic activity, this effect does not appear to be mediated via direct binding at the GENENOTIN. Taken together, these findings support the view that (1) GENEIN is the only GENEIN peptide that binds to and activates the GENEIN receptor and (2) GENEIN does not bind or stimulate CHEMICALIN binding in cells expressing the GENEIN.
12852767	Tethered dimers as NAD synthetase inhibitors with antibacterial activity. The solution-phase parallel synthesis of tethered dimers was employed to identify lead inhibitors of bacterial NAD synthetase. Active dimers contained two aromatic end groups joined by a polymethylene linker, with one end group containing a permanent positive charge. Effective inhibitors of NAD synthetase also inhibited the growth of Gram-positive (but not Gram-negative) bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains. The desmethyl precursors of active inhibitors lacked a permanent positive charge and were inactive as either enzyme inhibitors or antibacterial agents. Similarly, a close structural analogue of the most active inhibitors contained two additional ether oxygens in the tether and was inactive in both assays. These results are consistent with the premise that NAD synthetase inhibition is responsible for the antibacterial actions and support further studies on NAD synthetase as a new target for antibacterial agents.
12897749	Blockade of CHEMICALIN synthesis caused by additive inhibition of GENEIN phosphorylation: Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibition in human eosinophils. BACKGROUND: Prior investigations have demonstrated that GENENOTIN stimulation is ineffective in inhibiting synthesis of eicosanoids in human eosinophils. This effect has been postulated to relate to density or structural differences in the GENENOTIN or its coupled GENENOTIN. However, recent reports indicate that GENENOTIN activity in eosinophils is 10-fold that of other inflammatory cells. We postulated that selective blockade of CHEMICALNOTIN in eosinophils would unmask the inhibitory effect of GENENOTIN stimulation and that this inhibition would result from decreased phosphor-ylation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). OBJECTIVE: To determine (a) whether GENEIN inhibition alone with CHEMICALIN blocked secretions of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) caused by activation of eosinophils with CHEMICALNOTIN plus CHEMICALNOTIN (FMLP/B), (b) to determine if CHEMICALNOTIN inhibition plus GENENOTIN agonist act additively to augment endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN concentration, and (c) to determine the mechanism by which additive inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis is regulated by CHEMICALNOTIN. METHODS: Human eosinophils were pretreated with buffer, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (singly or combination) before FMLP/B activation. Release of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentration, and phosphorylation and activation of GENENOTIN were determined. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN unmasked the inhibitory effect of GENEIN stimulation with CHEMICALIN and significantly attenuated the stimulated release of CHEMICALNOTIN and subsequent CHEMICALNOTIN. Inhibition corresponded to increased CHEMICALNOTIN production caused by CHEMICALNOTIN alone or CHEMICALIN plus CHEMICALIN and blocked proportionately the phosphorylation and activation of GENEIN in FMLP/B-activated eosinophils. CONCLUSIONS: Inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN unmasks GENEIN blockade of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis caused by FMLP/B.
12942109	A phase 1 study of CHEMICALNOTIN in adults with advanced cancer. CHEMICALIN is an CHEMICALIN which is metabolised to CHEMICALIN and which binds selectively to the GENEIN GENEIN and GENEIN. The safety, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral CHEMICALNOTIN were determined over 12 weeks of treatment in 34 patients with advanced cancer. Commonly seen toxicities were mucocutaneous symptoms, musculoskeletal pain and headache. Dose-limiting toxicities were hypercalcaemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and musculoskeletal pain. The maximum tolerated dose of CHEMICALNOTIN in this schedule is 25.2 mg day(-1). Plasma concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN were found to peak rapidly within 1-3 h of dosing and thereafter declined quickly. The C(max) and AUC values on day 0, and weeks 2 and 4 were similar indicating no drug accumulation. The dose-normalised C(max) and AUC values at different dose levels and different study days appeared to be similar indicating linear pharmacokinetics. No objective responses were seen, although stable disease was seen in six out of eight evaluable patients receiving the three highest dose levels of CHEMICALNOTIN (16.8, 25.2 or 33.4 mg day(-1)). We conclude that oral CHEMICALNOTIN is well tolerated when administered daily for 12 weeks, has a favourable toxicity profile compared with other CHEMICALNOTIN and merits further investigation as an anticancer therapy.
1322047	Anabolic effects of CHEMICALIN on skeletal muscle are mediated by GENEIN activation. The potent anabolic effects of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN on skeletal muscle have been reported to be independent of actions on GENEIN. In the present study CHEMICALNOTIN, presented to rats in the diet (4 mg/kg), caused significant increases in gastrocnemius muscle mass, protein, and RNA content and a decrease in epididymal fat pad mass. These effects were not mimicked by oral administration of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN even at high dose (52 mg/kg diet), and the effects of CHEMICALIN were not inhibited by addition of CHEMICALIN (200 mg/kg diet). However, the selective beta 2-antagonist CHEMICALNOTIN (200 mg/kg diet) reversed the anabolic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, and a high dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (1,000 mg/kg diet) also inhibited these actions of CHEMICALNOTIN. Furthermore, continuous infusion of CHEMICALNOTIN (1.15 mg.kg body wt-1.day-1) via miniosmotic pumps did cause significant increases in muscle mass, protein, and RNA content. These results indicate that the anabolic effects of CHEMICALIN are dependent on interaction with the GENEIN. However, a long duration of action appears to be required to induce the anabolic effects of beta 2-agonists.
1356794	Evidence that an GENENOTIN subtype mediates antinociception in mice. In the hot-plate test in mice, the antinociceptive action of the GENEIN agonist, CHEMICALIN, was abolished by the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, the potent GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN and the preferential GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN. In contrast, the preferential GENENOTIN ligands ('antagonists'), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were inactive. The preferential GENEIN partial agonist, CHEMICALIN, partially inhibited CHEMICALIN-induced antinociception. Further, CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN reversibly elicited submaximal antinociception. It is concluded that GENENOTIN mediate antinociception in mice.
14596599	Crystal structure of GENENOTIN from rat liver. GENEIN GENEIN, GENEIN) catalyzes the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-dependent dehydration of CHEMICALIN to yield CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Liver GENENOTIN plays an important role in gluconeogenesis. Formation of CHEMICALIN by GENEIN is a two-step reaction in which the CHEMICALIN group of CHEMICALIN is cleaved to produce CHEMICALIN, and then the CHEMICALNOTIN is deaminated by nonenzymatic hydrolysis to produce CHEMICALIN. The crystal structure of GENENOTIN was determined by single isomorphous replacement at 2.8 A resolution. The GENEIN crystallized with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) was also determined at 2.6 A resolution by molecular replacement. GENENOTIN is composed of two domains, and each domain has a typical alphabeta-open structure. The active site is located in the cleft between the two domains. The GENEIN contained PLP-OMS CHEMICALIN in the active site, indicating that CHEMICALIN can form the CHEMICALNOTIN linkage with CHEMICALIN, but the subsequent dehydration did not occur. GENENOTIN forms a dimer by inserting the small domain into the catalytic cleft of the partner subunit so that the active site is closed. GENENOTIN also forms a dimer by making contacts at the back of the clefts so that the dimerization does not close the catalytic cleft. The phosphate group of CHEMICALIN is surrounded by a characteristic GENEIN ((168)CHEMICALIN(172)) and forms CHEMICALNOTIN bonds with the CHEMICALNOTIN groups of those CHEMICALNOTIN residues, suggesting that the CHEMICALNOTIN group can be protonated. N(1) of CHEMICALNOTIN participates in a CHEMICALNOTIN bond with Cys303, and similar CHEMICALNOTIN bonds with N(1) participating are seen in other beta-elimination enzymes. These CHEMICALNOTIN bonding schemes indicate that N(1) is not protonated, and thus, the CHEMICALNOTIN ring cannot take a CHEMICALNOTIN-like structure. These characteristics of the bound CHEMICALIN suggest that GENEIN catalysis is not facilitated by forming the resonance-stabilized structure of the CHEMICALIN as seen in GENEIN. A possible catalytic mechanism involves the CHEMICALNOTIN group, surrounded by the characteristic sequence, acting as a general acid to donate a proton to the leaving CHEMICALNOTIN group of CHEMICALNOTIN.
14633707	GENENOTIN autocrine signaling in RIE-1 cells transformed by the GENENOTIN oncogene enhances radiation resistance. Oncogenic forms of the small GENENOTIN GENENOTIN increase the resistance of cells to killing by ionizing radiation (IR). Although not all of the signaling pathways for radioresistance are well defined, it is now clear that GENENOTIN-dependent signaling pathways involved in radioresistance include those mediated by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN. Nevertheless, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN together are not sufficient to reconstitute all of the resistance conferred by GENENOTIN, indicating that other effectors must also contribute. We show here that GENENOTIN-driven autocrine signaling through the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) also contributes to radioresistance in GENENOTIN-transformed cells. Conditioned media (CM) collected from RIE-1 rat intestinal epithelial cells expressing oncogenic GENENOTIN increased the survival of irradiated cells. GENENOTIN-CM contains elevated levels of the GENENOTIN ligand GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Both GENENOTIN-CM and GENENOTIN stimulated GENENOTIN phosphorylation, and exogenous GENENOTIN mimicked the effects of GENENOTIN-CM to increase radioresistance. Blocking GENEIN signaling with the GENEIN/GENEIN kinase inhibitor (KI) CHEMICALIN decreased the postradiation survival of irradiated GENEIN-transformed cells and normal cells but had no effect on the survival of unirradiated cells. GENENOTIN-CM and GENENOTIN also increase GENEIN activity downstream of the GENEIN and increase postradiation survival, both of which are abrogated by CHEMICALIN. Thus, GENEIN utilizes autocrine signaling through GENENOTIN to increase radioresistance, and the GENEIN KI CHEMICALIN acts as a radiosensitizer. The observation that GENEIN-transformed cells can be sensitized to killing by ionizing radiation with CHEMICALIN demonstrates that GENEIN KIs could potentially be used to radiosensitize tumors in which radioresistance is dependent on GENENOTIN-driven autocrine signaling through GENENOTIN.
14660028	Characterization of GENENOTIN-mediated relaxation in rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle. The present study was carried out to characterize GENENOTIN subtypes mediating relaxation of rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle. CHEMICALNOTIN and a nonconventional GENEIN agonist, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), induced concentration-dependent relaxation of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.3 microM) preconstricted spiral preparations. Pretreatment with a combination of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN antagonist) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN antagonist) (0.1 microM for each) produced a 14-fold rightward shift of the concentration-response curve for CHEMICALNOTIN; however, the relaxation in response to CHEMICALNOTIN was unaffected by the blockade of GENENOTIN. In the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1 microM for each), the concentration-response curves for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were shifted to the right by a nonselective GENENOTIN antagonist, CHEMICALNOTIN (3 and 10 microM). These results clearly suggest that GENENOTIN are involved in GENENOTIN-mediated relaxation of rat abdominal aorta smooth muscle.
14716684	Use of the GENENOTIN as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of genetically modified cells. BACKGROUND: The GENEIN (GENEIN) is a high-affinity transporter for CHEMICALIN. Its expression is almost exclusively restricted to the sympathetic nervous system. In this study we evaluated whether the GENENOTIN can be used as a reporter gene for non-invasive imaging of genetically modified cells with radiolabeled probes. METHODS: Human A431, HT1080 and murine CMS-5 cells were retrovirally transduced with GENENOTIN cDNA. Transduced and parental cells were incubated in vitro with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). The specificity of tracer uptake was determined by adding the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. Rat PC12 cells served as positive controls. Parental and A431GENENOTIN cells were xenotransplanted into nude mice and tumor uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN in vivo was determined after tracer administration. RESULTS: In vitro stably transduced cells showed a 66- to 120-fold higher CHEMICALNOTIN uptake than parental cells. Incubation with CHEMICALNOTIN reduced CHEMICALNOTIN uptake of transduced cells to the level found in parental cells. More than 70% of the initial radioactivity was retained in all transduced cell lines after 2 h incubation with tracer-free medium. CHEMICALIN uptake in PC12 cells, which express the GENEIN endogenously, was 20- to 28-fold lower than in transduced cells. In vivo, A431GENEIN tumors demonstrated a 33-fold higher CHEMICALIN uptake than parental tumors. Gamma camera images 24 h after tracer injection showed no tracer uptake in parental A431 tumors, but clear images of A431GENENOTIN tumors. CONCLUSIONS: Transduction of tumor cells with GENENOTIN cDNA causes highly specific uptake and significant retention of CHEMICALNOTIN analogs in vitro and in vivo. These characteristics make the GENENOTIN suitable as a reporter gene for non-invasive monitoring of gene transfer.
14730417	Comparative pharmacology of GENENOTIN subtypes--characterization of stably transfected receptors in CHO cells. Although many GENENOTIN antagonists and GENENOTIN agonists have been used in pharmacotherapy for many years their pharmacological properties at all three known subtypes of GENENOTIN are not always well characterized. The aim of this study was, therefore, to provide comparative binding characteristics of agonists (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) and antagonists (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) at all three subtypes of GENEIN in an identical cellular background. We generated Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing the three GENENOTIN subtypes at comparable levels. We characterized these receptor subtypes and analyzed the affinity of routinely used drugs as well as experimental compounds in competition binding studies, using the non-selective antagonist CHEMICALNOTIN as a radioligand. Furthermore, we analyzed the GENENOTIN-mediated GENENOTIN activity in isolated membranes from these cell lines. The results from our experiments show that all compounds exhibit distinct patterns of selectivity and activity at the three GENENOTIN subtypes. In particular, a number of GENENOTIN agonists that are inverse agonists at the other subtypes were identified. In addition, GENENOTIN antagonists with agonistic activity at GENENOTIN were found. These specific mixtures of agonism, antagonism, and inverse agonism at different subtypes may have important implications for the therapeutic use of the respective compounds.
14733708	Ocular hypotensive FP prostaglandin (PG) analogs: PG receptor subtype binding affinities and selectivities, and agonist potencies at FP and other PG receptors in cultured cells. Natural prostaglandins (PGs) such as PGD2, PGE2, PGF2(2alpha), and PGI2 exhibited the highest affinity for their respective cognate receptors, but were the least selective agents when tested in receptor binding assays. Travoprost acid ([+]-fluprostenol) was the most FP-receptor-selective compound, exhibiting a high affinity (Ki = 35 +/- 5 nM) for the FP receptor, and minimal affinity for DP (Ki = 52,000 nM), EP1 (Ki = 9540 nM), EP3 (Ki = 3501 nM), EP4 (Ki = 41,000 nM), IP (Ki > 90,000 nM), and TP (Ki = 121,000 nM) receptors. Travoprost acid was the most potent PG analog tested in FP receptor functional phosphoinositide turnover assays in the following cell types: human ciliary muscle (EC50 = 1.4 nM), human trabecular meshwork (EC50 = 3.6 nM), and mouse fibroblasts and rat aortic smooth muscle cells (EC50 = 2.6 nM). Although latanoprost acid exhibited a relatively high affinity for the FP receptor (Ki = 98 nM), it had significant functional activity at FP (EC50 = 32-124 nM) and EP1 (EC50 = 119 nM) receptors. Bimatoprost acid was less selective, exhibiting a relatively high affinity for the FP (Ki = 83 nM), EP1 (Ki = 95 nM), and EP3 (Ki = 387 nM) receptors. Bimatoprost acid exhibited functional activity at the EP1 (EC50 = 2.7 nM) and FP (EC50 = 2.8-3.8 nM in most cells) receptors. Bimatoprost (nonhydrolyzed amide) also behaved as an FP agonist at the cloned human FP receptor (EC50 = 681 nM), in h-TM (EC50 = 3245 nM) and other cell types. Unoprostone and S-1033 bound with low affinity (Ki = 5.9 microM to > 22 microM) to the FP receptor, were not selective, but activated the FP receptor. In conclusion, travoprost acid has the highest affinity, the highest FP-receptor-selectivity, and the highest potency at the FP receptor as compared to the other ocular hypotensive PG analogs known so far, including free acids of latanoprost, bimatoprost, and unoprostone isopropyl ester.
14734046	Loss of GENENOTIN response in myocytes overexpressing the GENENOTIN. Increased GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and altered GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) responses are observed in failing human heart. To determine the possible interaction between these changes, we investigated the effect of GENENOTIN overexpression on responses to isoproterenol in adult rat ventricular myocytes. Responses to CHEMICALIN were largely mediated through the GENEIN in control myocytes. Adenovirally-mediated overexpression of GENEIN, at levels, which did not alter basal contraction of myocytes, markedly depressed the CHEMICALIN concentration-response curve. Responses to CHEMICALIN could be restored to normal by GENEIN blockade, suggesting a GENEIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN signalling. GENENOTIN normalised CHEMICALIN responses in GENENOTIN cells, indicating that GENEIN effects were mediated by GENENOTIN. Negative-inotropic effects of high concentrations of ICI 118,551, previously shown to be due to GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN coupling, were increased in GENENOTIN cells. We conclude that GENENOTIN upregulation can markedly alter the consequences of GENENOTIN stimulation and that this may contribute to the alterations in GENENOTIN response seen in failing human heart.
14741265	Manipulation of kinetic profiles in CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitors. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were modified in an attempt to alter the kinetics of inhibitor binding by GENEIN. Contrary to prior predictions, a CHEMICALNOTIN substituent is not sufficient to confer slow tight-binding behavior. Conversion of the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety of CHEMICALNOTIN to an CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN abolishes slow tight-binding behavior, regardless of halogenation state.
14751502	Effects of the GENEIN/GENEIN GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN on GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN-overexpressing breast cancer cell line proliferation, radiosensitization, and resistance. PURPOSE: Two members of the epidermal growth factor receptor family, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, have been implicated in radioresistance in breast cancer and other malignancies. To gauge the potential clinical utility of targeting both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN to control growth and radiosensitize human breast cancers, we examined the effect of a dual GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, on the proliferation and radiation response of either GENENOTIN- or GENENOTIN-overexpressing human breast cancer cell lines. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Primary human breast cancer cell lines that endogenously overexpress GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN and luminal mammary epithelial H16N2 cells stably transfected with GENENOTIN were evaluated for the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on inhibition of ligand-induced or GENENOTIN phosphorylation, proliferation, radiosensitization, and inhibition of downstream signaling. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN inhibited constitutive and/or ligand-induced GENEIN or GENEIN CHEMICALIN phosphorylation of all five cell lines, which correlated with the antiproliferative response in all but one cell line. CHEMICALIN radiosensitized GENEIN-overexpressing cell lines, but GENEIN-overexpressing cells were unable to form colonies after brief exposure to CHEMICALIN even in the absence of radiation, and thus could not be evaluated for radiosensitization. One cell line was resistant to the antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, despite receptor inhibition. Exploration of potential mechanisms of resistance in SUM185 cells revealed failure of CHEMICALIN to inhibit downstream GENEIN and GENEIN activation, despite inhibition of GENEIN phosphorylation. In contrast, sensitive GENENOTIN-overexpressing cell lines demonstrated inhibition of both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN phosphorylation. CONCLUSION: CHEMICALIN potently inhibits receptor phosphorylation in either GENEIN- or GENEIN-overexpressing cell lines and has both antiproliferative and radiosensitizing effects. Resistance to CHEMICALIN was not due to a lack of receptor inhibition, but rather with a lack of inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN, suggesting that measurement of inhibition of crucial signaling pathways may better predict response than inhibition of receptor phosphorylation. The SUM185 cell line provides a valuable model for studying mechanisms of resistance of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN inhibitor therapy.
14753499	Aquaporin-1 deletion reduces osmotic water permeability and cerebrospinal fluid production. Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) is a water channel that is strongly expressed at the ventricular-facing surface of choroid plexus epithelium. Using wildtype and AQP1 null mice, we developed novel methods to compare the water permeability in isolated choroid plexus, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production in living mice. Osmotically-induced water transport was rapid in freshly isolated choroid plexus from wildtype mice as measured by a spatial-filtering optical method, and reduced by 5-fold by AQP1 deletion. CSF production, an isosmolar fluid secretion process, was measured by a dye dilution method involving fluid collections using a second microneedle introduced into the cisterna magna. CSF production in wildtype mice was (in microl/min) 0.37 +/- 0.04 microl/min (control), 0.16 +/- 0.03 microl/min (acetazolamide-treated) and 1.14 +/- 0.15 microl/min (forskolin-treated), and reduced by up to 25% in AQP1 null mice. The impaired CSF production in AQP1 null mice provides direct functional evidence for the involvement of AQP1 in CSF formation.
14871885	CHEMICALIN, but not leptin, regulates GENEIN in pancreatic islets: impact on CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN secretion. CHEMICALIN, a drug widely used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, has recently been shown to act on skeletal muscle and liver in part through the activation of GENEIN (GENEIN). Whether CHEMICALIN or the satiety factor leptin, which also stimulates GENEIN in muscle, regulates this enzyme in pancreatic islets is unknown. We have recently shown that forced increases in GENENOTIN activity inhibit GENENOTIN secretion from MIN6 cells (da Silva Xavier G, Leclerc I, Varadi A, Tsuboi T, Moule SK, and Rutter GA. Biochem J 371: 761-774, 2003). Here, we explore whether 1) CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or leptin regulates GENENOTIN activity in isolated islets from rodent and human and 2) whether changes in GENENOTIN activity modulate GENENOTIN secretion from human islets. Increases in CHEMICALIN concentration from 0 to 3 and from 3 to 17 mM inhibited GENEIN activity in primary islets from mouse, rat, and human, confirming previous findings in insulinoma cells. Incubation with CHEMICALIN (0.2-1 mM) activated GENEIN in both human islets and MIN6 beta-cells in parallel with an inhibition of GENEIN secretion, whereas leptin (10-100 nM) was without effect in MIN6 cells. These studies demonstrate that GENEIN activity is subject to regulation by both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN in pancreatic islets and clonal beta-cells. The inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN secretion may therefore need to be considered with respect to the use of this drug for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
14993281	A novel GENENOTIN regulates CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN expression. The mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is of broad relevance to cell and developmental biology, nutrition, and cancer chemotherapy. CHEMICALIN is known to induce expression of the GENEIN (GENEIN) gene which propels CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cell cycle arrest and differentiation of HL-60 human myeloblastic leukemia cells, motivating the present analysis of transcriptional regulation of GENEIN expression by CHEMICALIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN-treated HL-60 cells used here expressed all GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) subtypes (as detected by Northern analysis) except GENENOTIN. Treatment with GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN-selective ligands showed that GENENOTIN synergized with GENENOTIN to transcriptionally activate GENENOTIN expression. A 5'-flanking region capable of supporting CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN activation in HL-60 cells was found to contain a 205-bp sequence in the distal portion that was necessary for transcriptional activation by CHEMICALNOTIN. Within this sequence GENENOTIN footprinting revealed that CHEMICALIN induced binding of a GENEIN to an element containing two GENEIN. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) and supershift assays showed that this element bound recombinant GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Without CHEMICALNOTIN there was neither complex binding nor transcriptional activation. Both GENEIN were needed for binding the complex, and mutation of either GENENOTIN caused the loss of transcriptional activation by CHEMICALIN. The ability of this cis-acting GENEIN to activate transcription in response to CHEMICALIN also depended on downstream sequences where an GENEIN (GENENOTIN) site and a GENEIN (GENEIN) site between this element and the transcriptional start, as well as a GENEIN (GENEIN) site between the transcriptional start and first exon of the GENEIN gene, were necessary. Each of these sites bound its corresponding transcription factor. A transcription factor-transcription factor binding array analysis of nuclear lysate from CHEMICALIN-treated cells indicated several prominent GENEIN binding partners; among these, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN were identified by competition EMSA and supershift and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays as components of the complex. CHEMICALNOTIN upregulated expression of these three factors. In sum the results of the present study indicate that CHEMICALIN-induced expression of GENEIN expression depends on a novel GENEIN. This cis-acting element approximately 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start consists of two GENENOTIN that bind GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in a GENENOTIN that also contains GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN bound to their cognate downstream consensus binding sites.
15002740	The persistent membrane retention of CHEMICALIN causes lasting inhibition of GENEIN function. The present study examined the potential membrane retention of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) following exposures of 293-GENENOTIN cells to CHEMICALNOTIN, and its effect on CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. Incubation of cells with 500 nM CHEMICALNOTIN for 1 h or 1 day persistently inhibited the uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN up to 7 days, despite daily repeated washing of cells with drug-free medium. Uptake inhibition was paralleled by persistent retention of CHEMICALNOTIN associated with cells, as determined by HPLC and by radiotracer experiments using CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN trapped in membranes was displaceable by the structurally unrelated GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, in a concentration-dependent manner, implying interaction of retained CHEMICALIN with the GENEIN. A similar cellular retention was observed following incubation of cells with CHEMICALNOTIN. The results demonstrate that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are persistently retained in cell membranes, at least partly in association with the GENEIN. The retention and slow diffusion of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN from membranes may contribute to their pharmacological and modulatory action on GENEIN.
15030294	GENENOTIN-receptor antagonism in hypertension: what has been learned with CHEMICALNOTIN? CHEMICALIN is a long-acting GENEIN antagonist acting specifically at the level of the Type 1-receptor subtype (GENEIN-receptor). This compound lowers blood pressure dose-dependently in hypertensive patients and has a placebo-like tolerability. The antihypertensive efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN is greatly enhanced by the coadministration of a diuretic, and fixed-dose combinations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are now available. CHEMICALNOTIN-based treatment appears especially effective for high-risk patients, such as those with diabetes, renal disease and cardiac hypertrophy. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, CHEMICALNOTIN delays the development of nephropathy as well as the progression of renal failure. CHEMICALIN may have antiatherosclerotic properties beyond those expected from blood pressure lowering per se: this GENEIN-blocker decreases the vascular oxidative stress and prevents the procoagulant as well as the pro-inflammatory effects of GENEIN. Irbesartan given alone or in combination with a diuretic therefore represents a rational approach to treat hypertensive patients.
15060759	Binding of CHEMICALIN at two sites in recombinant GENEIN and interaction with beta-blockers. To verify the hypothesis that the non-conventional partial agonist CHEMICALIN binds at two GENEIN sites, GENEIN, expressed in CHO cells, were labelled with CHEMICALIN. We compared the binding affinity and antagonist potency of 12 clinically used beta-blockers against the CHEMICALNOTIN-enhancing effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN.CHEMICALNOTIN bound to a high affinity site (H; K(H)=0.47 nM) and low affinity site (L); K(L)=235 nM). CHEMICALIN dissociated from the GENEIN with a fast component (k(off)=0.45 min(-1)), consistent with the L-site, and a slow component (k(off)=0.017-0.033 min(-1)), consistent with the H-site. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN caused 96-fold and 12-fold maximal increases in CHEMICALNOTIN levels with -logEC(50)M of 8.2 and 7.6. CHEMICALNOTIN antagonised the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN with a pK(B) of 9.9. The beta-blockers antagonised the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN more than the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN with potency ratios: CHEMICALNOTIN 1,000, CHEMICALNOTIN 676, CHEMICALNOTIN 631, CHEMICALNOTIN 589, CHEMICALNOTIN 204, CHEMICALNOTIN 138, CHEMICALNOTIN 132, CHEMICALNOTIN 120, CHEMICALNOTIN 95, CHEMICALNOTIN 81, CHEMICALNOTIN 68 and CHEMICALNOTIN 56. In intact cells the binding constants of beta-blockers, estimated from competition with 3-5 nM CHEMICALNOTIN (binding to the H-site), correlated with the corresponding affinities estimated from antagonism of the CHEMICALNOTIN effects. We conclude that CHEMICALIN binds at two sites in the recombinant GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is an antagonist of CHEMICALNOTIN effects through the H-site and a non-conventional partial agonist through the L-site. beta-blockers are more potent antagonists through the H-site than the L-site.
15072849	CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN agonist, induces GENEIN in cytotoxic T lymphocytes in vitro. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an activator of GENEIN (GENEIN), induces by several routes a profound anti-viral and anti-tumor effect in vivo. Physiologically, the immune system is using GENENOTIN-containing granules of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) towards the same biological purpose. This functional synergism prompted our current experiments addressing the question whether CHEMICALNOTIN may influence GENENOTIN-release and/or induce GENENOTIN in CTLs in vitro. In peripheral lymphocytes of healthy and diseased subjects, CHEMICALIN induced a significant increase of GENEIN(+) CTLs within 12h in all experiments performed. This effect was most pronounced in CTLs of patients suffering from atopic dermatitis, a model disorder for subnormal GENENOTIN expression: as compared to GENENOTIN(+) CTLs detected at time point zero (100%), up to 270% of GENEIN(+) CTLs were induced by 2.5 microg/ml [corrected] CHEMICALIN. GENEIN release from peripheral blood CTLs after PMA/ionomycin-stimulation was not influenced significantly by CHEMICALIN. Thus, the biological activity of CHEMICALIN appears to exceed its previously known functions, inasmuch as it boosts up significantly the GENEIN-granule system.
15095008	Caffeine as a psychomotor stimulant: mechanism of action. The popularity of caffeine as a psychoactive drug is due to its stimulant properties, which depend on its ability to reduce adenosine transmission in the brain. Adenosine A(1) and A(2A) receptors are expressed in the basal ganglia, a group of structures involved in various aspects of motor control. Caffeine acts as an antagonist to both types of receptors. Increasing evidence indicates that the psychomotor stimulant effect of caffeine is generated by affecting a particular group of projection neurons located in the striatum, the main receiving area of the basal ganglia. These cells express high levels of adenosine A(2A) receptors, which are involved in various intracellular processes, including the expression of immediate early genes and regulation of the dopamine- and cyclic AMP-regulated 32-kDa phosphoprotein DARPP-32. The present review focuses on the effects of caffeine on striatal signal transduction and on their involvement in caffeine-mediated motor stimulation.
15133856	Mesenteric artery remodeling and effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on it in spontaneously hypertensive rats. AIM: To investigate the remodeling of mesenteric artery and the expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN in mesenteric artery and effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the remodeling in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). METHODS: Thirty SHR (male/female, 21/9), aged 13 wk, were randomly divided into 3 groups (7 male rats and 3 female rats each group): SHR group, CHEMICALNOTIN group (CHEMICALNOTIN 3 mg/kg.d was given in drinking water for 14 wk), and CHEMICALNOTIN group (CHEMICALNOTIN 50 mg/kg.d was given in drinking water foe 14 wk). Ten homogeneous Wistar Kyoto rats, 5 males and 5 females, weighing 206+/-49 g, were selected as normal control group (WKY group). Systolic pressure was measured on d 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 during the experiment and the rats were killed at the end of the experiment. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) level in plasma and mesenteric arteries was measured by radioimmunoassay. The morphology of the secondary branches of mesenteric artery were examined by light microscopy and electron microscopy. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect the expression of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA. RESULTS: Compared with CHEMICALNOTIN group and CHEMICALNOTIN group, the blood pressure was remarkably increased in SHR group. GENEIN level in plasma and mesenteric arteries in SHR group was the same or lower than that in WKY group, and was higher in CHEMICALIN group and lower in CHEMICALIN group. The remodeling of mesenteric arteries in SHR group was mostly obvious among the 4 groups. The ratio of GENEIN absorbed light value to GENEIN absorbed light value in the SHR group was 0.887+/-0.019, which was significantly higher than that in WKY group, CHEMICALIN group, and CHEMICALIN group with the ratios of 0.780+/-0.018, 0.803+/-0.005, and 0.847+/-0.017, respectively (P<0.01). GENEIN level in plasma and mesenteric arteries in CHEMICALIN group was significantly lower than that in CHEMICALIN group (P<0.05). The GENEIN absorbed light value/GENEIN absorbed light value of mesenteric arteries in the SHR group was 0.850+/-0.015, which was significantly higher than that in the WKY, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN groups (0.582+/-0.013, 0.743+/-0.012, and 0.789+/-0.013, respectively, P<0.01), and was significantly lower in CHEMICALNOTIN group than in CHEMICALNOTIN group (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN can not only control blood pressure but also inhibit mesenteric arteries remodeling and mRNA expression of GENEIN, GENEIN in SHR. CHEMICALNOTIN is more effective than CHEMICALNOTIN.
15184278	Clinical assessment of GENENOTIN blockade through biochemical and pharmacological profiles. BACKGROUND: To assess the sensitivity of biochemical, physiological, and pharmacological markers of peripheral GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) function, we chronically antagonized GENEIN by a range of doses of CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], which blocks the CHEMICALIN reuptake process. METHODS AND RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN was administered in a randomized, placebo-controlled study in 15 healthy volunteers. Plasma from CHEMICALIN-treated subjects (ex vivo effect) dose-dependently decreased radioligand binding to GENEIN (maximum inhibition was 60%) (P=0.02). The dose of intravenous tyramine required to raise systolic blood pressure by 30 mm Hg (PD30) increased dose-dependently with duloxetine and was significant at the end of the 120-mg/d dosage (P<0.001). The plasma CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN) ratio was reduced significantly at 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d CHEMICALNOTIN (11.3 at baseline, 3.4 at 240 mg/d, P<0.001). Plasma CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly increased starting at 120 mg/d CHEMICALNOTIN. Urine results (corrected for 24-hour CHEMICALNOTIN excretion) showed a dose-dependent change from the baseline urinary excretion for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and the CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN ratio. The most sensitive measure, the CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN ratio, was significant at the 80-mg dose. Urinary CHEMICALNOTIN excretion was significantly raised after 2 weeks of treatment with 80 mg/d CHEMICALNOTIN (P<0.001), the lowest dose used in the study. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the degree of GENENOTIN blockade can be assessed with the plasma or urine CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN ratio and the pressor effect of tyramine. Also, the CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN ratio is more sensitive at the lower end of GENENOTIN inhibition, whereas tyramine exhibits a linear relation, with GENENOTIN inhibition commencing at a higher dose.
15191400	CHEMICALNOTIN increases apoptosis and ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the rat isolated heart. CHEMICALIN, an antirheumatic gold compound, is an inhibitor of GENEIN, such as GENEIN and GENEIN. These enzymes play an important role in protecting cardiac tissue from oxidative stress generated during ischaemia-reperfusion. CHEMICALNOTIN (100 mg/kg) was administered to rats and their hearts were subjected to an in vitro model of ischaemia-reperfusion. The activity of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was determined in liver and heart tissues in an attempt to correlate enzymatic activity with heart recovery after ischaemia-reperfusion. There was significantly less GENEIN activity in rat liver extracts, whereas the level of CHEMICALNOTIN activity remained unchanged, demonstrating that the dose of CHEMICALIN used was able to selectively inhibit one of these enzyme systems. Rats administered CHEMICALNOTIN displayed significantly impaired recovery from ischaemic insult. The end diastolic pressure was increased, whereas the rate pressure product was significantly decreased. The level of postischaemic apoptosis was also assessed by examining GENENOTIN activity in tissue homogenates. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly increased the degree of postischaemic apoptosis, leading to poor postischaemic recovery.
15206110	CHEMICALNOTIN and other main group metal compounds as antitumor agents. CHEMICALNOTIN has been the second metal to show activity against malignant tumors in humans soon after the establishment of CHEMICALNOTIN drugs in routine clinical practice. It has the unique property of inhibiting tumor growth as a simple cation, mainly because of its close resemblance to CHEMICALNOTIN. Even though its inability to shift between the trivalent and a divalent oxidation state precludes that CHEMICALIN behaves as an CHEMICALIN analogue in every respect, it strongly interferes with cellular acquisition of iron from blood by competitive interaction with GENEIN and GENEIN-mediated endocytosis. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN also seems to affect intracellular availability of CHEMICALNOTIN already taken up via this pathway, probably due to its inhibitory activity on GENEIN. Apart from the consequences of CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation, CHEMICALIN exerts cytotoxic effects by direct interaction with the CHEMICALIN-dependent enzyme GENEIN, resulting in reduced dNTP pools and inhibition of DNA synthesis. Both the abundance of GENEIN and upregulation of GENEIN render tumors susceptible to CHEMICALIN-induced cytotoxicity. However, some experimental findings raise the question whether these effects resulting from the CHEMICALIN-mimicking properties of CHEMICALIN are solely responsible for its antineoplastic activity or whether additional mechanisms are involved, such as antimitotic effects which result from its capability of inhibiting GENEIN polymerization. The limitations experienced with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, which call for a prolonged exposure to low steady-state CHEMICALNOTIN levels in blood in order to adequately exploit the affinity of CHEMICALNOTIN to tumor tissues and to avoid severe toxic effects, may be overcome by oral CHEMICALNOTIN complexes such as CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and show promise to initiate a revival of CHEMICALNOTIN in the clinical setting. These two investigational drugs, albeit differing in their complex stability, have both been developed with the intention of providing CHEMICALNOTIN in a form which allows sufficient intestinal absorption, but without altering its pharmacodynamic effects. CHEMICALNOTIN complexes based on other rationales are scarce and, with regard to the well-known antineoplastic potential of this metal, noticeably under-explored. With the recent approval of arsenic CHEMICALNOTIN for the second-line treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia, the clinical revival of CHEMICALNOTIN compounds, which have been the mainstay of antileukemic therapy before the age of modern cancer chemotherapy, has already begun. Currently, strong efforts are being made to explore the activity spectrum in other (less rare) malignancies and to gain a deeper insight into the mode of action. Although this development is currently focusing on CHEMICALNOTIN, it should be suited to stimulate investigations into the therapeutic potential of other CHEMICALNOTIN compounds as well.
15210974	The GENEIN is the binding site for the antiepileptic drug CHEMICALIN. Here, we show that the GENEIN is the brain binding site of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a new antiepileptic drug with a unique activity profile in animal models of seizure and epilepsy. The CHEMICALNOTIN-binding site is enriched in synaptic vesicles, and photoaffinity labeling of purified synaptic vesicles confirms that it has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 90 kDa. Brain membranes and purified synaptic vesicles from mice lacking GENENOTIN do not bind a tritiated CHEMICALNOTIN derivative, indicating that GENEIN is necessary for CHEMICALIN binding. CHEMICALIN and related compounds bind to GENEIN expressed in fibroblasts, indicating that GENEIN is sufficient for CHEMICALIN binding. No binding was observed to the related isoforms GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Furthermore, there is a high degree of correlation between binding affinities of a series of CHEMICALIN derivatives to GENEIN in fibroblasts and to the CHEMICALNOTIN-binding site in brain. Finally, there is a strong correlation between the affinity of a compound for GENENOTIN and its ability to protect against seizures in an audiogenic mouse animal model of epilepsy. These experimental results suggest that GENEIN is the binding site of CHEMICALIN in the brain and that CHEMICALIN acts by modulating the function of GENEIN, supporting previous indications that CHEMICALNOTIN possesses a mechanism of action distinct from that of other antiepileptic drugs. Further, these results indicate that proteins involved in vesicle exocytosis, and GENENOTIN in particular, are promising targets for the development of new CNS drug therapies.
15240758	Electrophysiological properties of mouse horizontal cell GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced currents have been characterized in isolated horizontal cells from lower vertebrates but not in mammalian horizontal cells. Therefore horizontal cells were isolated after enzymatical and mechanical dissociation of the adult mouse retina and visually identified. We recorded from horizontal cell bodies using the whole cell and outside-out configuration of the patch-clamp technique. Extracellular application of CHEMICALNOTIN induced inward currents carried by CHEMICALNOTIN ions. CHEMICALIN-evoked currents were completely and reversibly blocked by the competitive GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (IC50 = 1.7 microM), indicating expression of GENENOTIN but not GENENOTIN. Their affinity for CHEMICALIN was moderate (EC50 = 30 microM), and the Hill coefficient was 1.3, corresponding to two GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN responses were partially reduced by CHEMICALNOTIN with differential effects on peak and steady-state current values. CHEMICALNOTIN blocked the CHEMICALNOTIN response with an IC50 value of 7.3 microM in a noncompetitive manner. Furthermore, GENEIN of horizontal cells were modulated by extracellular application of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, thus showing typical pharmacological properties of CNS GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked single-channel currents were characterized by a main conductance state of 29.8 pS and two subconductance states (20.2 and 10.8 pS, respectively). Kinetic analysis of single-channel events within bursts revealed similar mean open and closed times for the main conductance and the 20.2-pS subconductance state, resulting in open probabilities of 44.6 and 42.7%, respectively. The ratio of open to closed times, however, was significantly different for the 10.8-pS subconductance state with an open probability of 57.2%.
15255990	Decreased GENENOTIN binding in the brain of depressed patients. The central histaminergic neuron system modulates the wakefulness, sleep-awake cycle, appetite control, learning and memory, and emotion. Previous studies have reported changes in neuronal CHEMICALNOTIN release and its metabolism under stress conditions in the mammalian brain. In this study, we examined, using positron emission tomography (PET) and CHEMICALNOTIN, whether the histaminergic neuron system is involved in human depression. Cerebral GENEIN (GENEIN) binding was measured in 10 patients with major depression and in 10 normal age-matched subjects using PET and CHEMICALIN. Data were calculated by a graphical analysis on voxel-by-voxel and ROI (region of interests) basis. Binding potential (BP) values for CHEMICALNOTIN binding in the frontal and prefrontal cortices, and cingulate gyrus were significantly lower in the depressed patients than those in the normal control subjects. There was no area of the brain where CHEMICALNOTIN binding was significantly higher in the depressed patients than in the controls. ROI-based analysis also revealed that BP values for CHEMICALNOTIN binding in the frontal cortex and cingulate gyrus decreased in proportion to self-rating depressive scales scores. The results of this study demonstrate that depressed patients have decreased brain GENENOTIN binding and that this decrease correlates with the severity of depression symptoms. It is therefore suggested that the histaminergic neuron system plays an important role in the pathophysiology of depression and that its modulation may prove to be useful in the treatment of depression.
15286093	Central effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN: measurement of psychomotor performance, subjective sleepiness, and brain GENEIN occupancy using CHEMICALIN positron emission tomography. GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonists, or CHEMICALIN, often induce sedative side effects when used for the treatment of allergic disorders. This study compared the sedative profiles of the second-generation CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, using 3 different criteria: subjective sleepiness evaluated by the Stanford Sleepiness Scale, objective psychomotor tests (simple and choice reaction time tests and visual discrimination tests at 4 different exposure durations), and measurement of GENEIN occupancy (H1RO) in the brain. Subjective sleepiness and psychomotor performance were measured in 20 healthy Japanese volunteers at baseline and 90 min after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN 120 mg or CHEMICALNOTIN 20 mg in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. CHEMICALNOTIN 30 mg was included as a positive control. H1RO was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) with CHEMICALNOTIN in 12 of the 20 subjects, and a further 11 volunteers were recruited to act as controls. In psychomotor tests, CHEMICALNOTIN was not significantly different from placebo and significantly less impairing than CHEMICALNOTIN on some tasks, as well as significantly less impairing than CHEMICALNOTIN on all tasks. For subjective sleepiness, CHEMICALNOTIN was not significantly different from placebo, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN showed a trend toward increased sleepiness compared with CHEMICALNOTIN and placebo. H1RO was negligible with CHEMICALNOTIN (-0.1%) but moderately high with CHEMICALNOTIN (26.0%). In conclusion, CHEMICALNOTIN 120 mg is distinguishable from CHEMICALNOTIN 20 mg, as assessed by H1RO and psychomotor testing.
15352500	A novel membrane sensor for GENEIN antagonist "CHEMICALIN". The construction and general performance of thirteen new polymeric membrane sensors for the determination of CHEMICALNOTIN based on its ion exchange with reineckate, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN have been studied. The effects of membrane composition, type of plasticizer, pH value of sample solution and concentration of the analyte in the sensor internal solution have been thoroughly investigated. The novel sensor based on reineckate exchanger shows a stable, potentiometric response for CHEMICALNOTIN in the concentration range of 1 x 10(-2) - 2.5 x 10(-6) M at 25 degrees C that is independent of pH in the range of 2.0 - 4.5. The sensor possesses a Nernstian cationic slope of 62.3+/-0.7 mV/concentration decade and a lower detection limit of 1.3 x 10(-6) M with a fast response time of 20 - 40 s. Selectivity coefficients for a number of interfering ions and excipients relative to CHEMICALNOTIN were investigated. There is negligible interference from almost all studied cations, anions, and pharmaceutical excipients, however, CHEMICALNOTIN that has a structure homologous to that of CHEMICALNOTIN was found to interfere. The determination of CHEMICALNOTIN in aqueous solution shows an average recovery of 99.83% with a mean relative standard deviation (RSD) of 0.5%. Direct potentiometric determination of CHEMICALNOTIN in tablets gave results that compare favorably with those obtained by standard spectrophotometric methods. Potentiometric titration of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN as a titrant has been monitored with the proposed sensor as an end point indicator electrode.
15353299	GENENOTIN: a critical target in cancer therapy? For the last four decades, synthesis and testing of potentially active drugs (e.g., antimetabolites) have focused on structural modification of existing metabolites as precursors of DNA and RNA synthesis. In recent years, the focus has shifted to synthesis of target-specific agents. Thus, the current emphasis of drug development is directed at inhibiting specific target(s) expressed preferentially, if not exclusively, in tumor tissues, with the ultimate goal of improving the therapeutic efficacy and selectivity of these new agents. Preclinically, proof-of-principle studies were carried out in tumors with specific expression of the intended target. With the hope of translating preclinical findings to the design of implementation of clinical trials. GENEIN (GENEIN) continues to be a critical target for CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and its prodrugs, CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN, primarily because this enzyme is essential for the synthesis of CHEMICALIN, a precursor for DNA synthesis. While CHEMICALNOTIN antimetabolites have other sites of action, antifolates CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) are more specific and potent GENEIN inhibitors. Thus, it is hoped that pronounced and sustained inhibition of this enzyme could result in downstream regulation of molecular markers associated with sensitivity and resistance to these agents. It is also critical to recognize that the degree and duration of inhibition of the target enzyme may depend on the expression level of the target enzyme, GENENOTIN. Correlative studies in preclinical and clinical systems demonstrated a close relationship between the enzyme level (mRNA and protein) and response to therapy of colorectal cancer patients treated with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. However, significant overlap was demonstrated between responders and non-responders. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that prediction of response to anticancer drugs is multifactorial, and GENENOTIN is one target. Clinically, although overall response of colorectal cancer patients to a variety of GENENOTIN inhibitors is similar, toxicity profiles are different. The availability of the CHEMICALNOTIN prodrugs offers the possibility of greater therapeutic selectivity based on the demonstration that GENEIN, the activating enzyme for CHEMICALIN, is expressed at a higher level in tumor tissue compared with normal tissue counterparts. It is likely that successful application of GENENOTIN inhibitors will not only be based on measurement of the GENENOTIN level in tumors vs. normal tissues, but on the delineation of the consequences of this inhibition on molecular markers associated with cellular proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation.
15382615	[Pharmacological treatment of obesity]. The pharmacological treatment of obesity should be considered when cannot be achieved a 10% weight loss with diet therapy and physical activity. The drugs effective in obesity treatment may act by different mechanisms such as reduction in food intake, inhibition of fat absorption, increase of thermogenesis and stimulation of adipocyte apoptosis. At present, we only have two marketed drugs for obesity treatment. CHEMICALNOTIN is an inhibitor of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and serotonina reuptake which inhibits food intake and increases thermogenesis. CHEMICALNOTIN administration for a year can induce a weight loss of 4-7%. Its main side effects are hypertension, headache, insomnia and constipation. CHEMICALIN is an inhibitor of GENEIN which is able to block the absorption of 30% of ingested fat. Its administration induces weight loss and reduction of ulterior weight regain. Also, this drug improves hypertension dyslipdaemia and helps to prevent diabetes in 52% of cases when administered over four years. The increase in frequency of stools and interference with vitamin absorption are its main side effects. GENENOTIN, which increases GENENOTIN sensitivity and satiety, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN agonists which reduce GENENOTIN resistance and modulates adipocyte generation are the basis for future therapeutic approaches of obesity. GENENOTIN inhibitors induce GENENOTIN phosphorylation and GENENOTIN expression leading to an increase in thermogenesis and reduction in appetite.
15465654	Viability assessment in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes after xenobiotic exposure. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibit the GENEIN (GENEIN) which transports CHEMICALIN into bile. Sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes maintain functional GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transport proteins, and may be useful to study inhibition of transport by xenobiotics at concentrations below the lowest observable adverse effect level (LOAEL). The purpose of this study was to compare viability assessments determined with the neutral red, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN assays in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes following exposure to xenobiotics known to inhibit GENENOTIN, and to define the LOAEL for these xenobiotics in this system. The neutral red assay was not amenable to use in this model due to crystal formation on the GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN decreased viability in every assay examined, with a LOAEL approximately 100 microM. CHEMICALIN also decreased viability as measured by the GENEIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN assays, with a LOAEL approximately 200 microM; however, a significant decrease in viability was not observed with the CHEMICALNOTIN assay. CHEMICALNOTIN did not decrease viability with any assay at the xenobiotic concentrations examined in this study. Based on the results of this study, the GENENOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN assays would be the methods of choice to assess viability in sandwich-cultured rat hepatocytes after xenobiotic exposure.
15494548	CHEMICALIN: assessment of GENEIN potency and selectivity. The discovery of a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) led to the search for compounds that could selectively inhibit GENENOTIN in humans while sparing CHEMICALIN formation from GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were among the molecules developed from these efforts. We report here the pharmacological properties of a third selective GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, which is the most potent and in vitro selective of the marketed GENEIN inhibitors that we have studied. Recombinant GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were used to screen for new highly potent and in vitro selective GENENOTIN inhibitors and compare kinetic mechanisms of binding and enzyme inhibition with other GENENOTIN inhibitors. CHEMICALIN potently inhibits recombinant GENEIN, with an IC(50) of 0.005 microM; this compares with IC values of 0.05 microM for CHEMICALIN, 0.5 microM for CHEMICALIN, and 5 microM for CHEMICALIN. Unique binding interactions of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN translate into a fast rate of inactivation of GENEIN (110,000 M/s compared with 7000 M/s for CHEMICALIN and 80 M/s for CHEMICALIN). The overall saturation binding affinity for GENEIN of CHEMICALIN is 2.6 nM (compared with 1.6 nM for CHEMICALIN, 51 nM for CHEMICALIN, and 260 nM for CHEMICALIN), with a slow off-rate (t(1/2) approximately 98 min). CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN in a competitive fashion only at very high concentrations (IC(50) = 150 microM). Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for the potency and in vitro selectivity of CHEMICALIN for GENEIN. CHEMICALIN showed similar activity in the GENEIN assay (GENEIN IC(50) = 0.24 microM; GENEIN IC(50) = 21.9 microM). We also determined whether this in vitro potency and selectivity translated to significant potency in vivo. In rats, CHEMICALNOTIN demonstrated marked potency in acute and chronic models of inflammation (air pouch ED(50) = 0.06 mg/kg; paw edema ED(50) = 5.9 mg/kg; adjuvant arthritis ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg). In these same animals, GENENOTIN was spared at doses greater than 200 mg/kg. These data provide a basis for the observed potent anti-inflammatory activity of CHEMICALNOTIN in humans.
15498586	An GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN augments CHEMICALIN uptake and GENEIN protein expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Evidence has accumulated that some of the GENENOTIN antagonists have GENENOTIN-sensitizing property. We thus examined the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN action using 3T3-L1 adipocytes. With standard differentiation inducers, a higher dose of CHEMICALNOTIN effectively facilitated differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Treatment of both differentiating adipocytes and fully differentiated adipocytes with CHEMICALIN caused a dose-dependent increase in mRNA levels for GENEIN target genes such as GENEIN and GENEIN. By contrast, CHEMICALIN attenuated GENEIN mRNA level in differentiated adipocytes. Of note, we demonstrated for the first time that CHEMICALIN augmented GENEIN protein expression and CHEMICALIN uptake both in basal and GENENOTIN-stimulated state of adipocytes, which may contribute, at least partly, to its GENENOTIN-sensitizing ability.
15557128	Pharmacogenetic differences in response to CHEMICALNOTIN between Puerto Ricans and Mexicans with asthma. BACKGROUND: In the United States, Puerto Ricans and Mexicans have the highest and lowest asthma prevalence, morbidity, and mortality, respectively. Ethnic-specific differences in the response to drug treatment may contribute to differences in disease outcomes. Genetic variants at the GENEIN (GENEIN) may modify asthma severity and CHEMICALIN responsiveness. We tested the association of GENEIN genotypes with asthma severity and bronchodilator response to CHEMICALIN in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans with asthma. METHODS: We used both family-based and cross-sectional tests of association with 8 GENENOTIN single CHEMICALNOTIN polymorphisms in 684 Puerto Rican and Mexican families. Regression analyses were used to determine the interaction between genotype, asthma severity, and bronchodilator drug responsiveness. RESULTS: Among Puerto Ricans with asthma, the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) 16 allele was associated with greater bronchodilator response using both family-based and cross-sectional tests (p = 0.00001-0.01). We found a strong interaction of baseline FEV(1) with the GENEIN (CHEMICALIN) polymorphism in predicting bronchodilator response. Among Puerto Ricans with asthma with baseline FEV(1) < 80% of predicted, but not in those with FEV(1) > 80%, there was a very strong association between the Arg16 genotype and greater bronchodilator responsiveness. No association was observed between GENENOTIN genotypes and drug responsiveness among Mexicans with asthma. CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic-specific pharmacogenetic differences exist between GENENOTIN genotypes, asthma severity, and bronchodilator response in Puerto Ricans and Mexicans with asthma. These findings underscore the need for additional research on racial/ethnic differences in asthma morbidity and drug responsiveness.
15577244	GENENOTIN inhibitors from Rhododendron collettianum and their structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies. A new CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (1) together with the new glycoside CHEMICALNOTIN (2) have been isolated from the aerial parts of Rhododendron collettianum and their structures determined on the basis of spectroscopic evidences. GENENOTIN inhibition study of these compounds and their structure-activity relationship (SAR) were also investigated. The compounds exhibited potent to mild inhibition activity against the enzyme. Especially, the compound 1 showed strong inhibition (IC50=1.33 microM) against the enzyme GENEIN, as compared to the standard tyrosinase inhibitors CHEMICALIN (IC50=16.67 microM) and CHEMICALIN (IC50=3.68 microM), indicating its potential used for the treatment of hyperpigmentation associated with the high production of melanocytes.
15646817	In vivo activity of the potent CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist on uterine activity in the rat. GENEIN antagonist (OTA), CHEMICALIN, was developed by our group and shown to inhibit either spontaneous or GENEIN-induced uterine contractions in primates. The purpose of the present study was to confirm the duration of CHEMICALIN to block GENEIN-induced uterine contractions in estrous rats. In Experiment 1, the time-response of the three OTAs on uterine contractility was examined. The rats were anesthetized and cannulas were placed in the jugular vein for infusing vehicle (sterile saline), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The uterine activity was monitored through a water-filled balloon-tipped cannula placed in the uterine horn. The uterine contractile activity was determined as the integrated area for 10 minutes. Each OTA was administered as a single bolus injection of 5 microg, followed by 100 mU of CHEMICALNOTIN 5 minutes later, also done as a single bolus. CHEMICALNOTIN injection of the same dosage was repeated every hour for 5 hours. Experiment 2 determined the effect of the three OTAs on uterine GENENOTIN number (Rn) and binding affinity (Kd). Rats treated with either OTA or vehicle were sacrificed at 0.5 and 4 hours for receptor assay. In Experiment 1, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited the integrated uterine response to GENEIN at 5 minutes by 76%, 77% and 80%, respectively, compared to controls (p<0.05). Two hours after injecting CHEMICALNOTIN, inhibition of uterine contractility was 55% lower than controls (p<0.05). At 3 hours, uterine contractility was no longer affected in rats treated with CHEMICALNOTIN compared with controls. The suppressive uterine activity with CHEMICALNOTIN continued up to 3 hours. However, uterine contractility remained lower (53%) in rats treated with CHEMICALNOTIN 5 hours later. In Experiment 2, CHEMICALIN induced a significant decrease (p<0.05) in GENEIN number and binding affinity at both 0.5 and 4 hours compared with controls. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN did not alter GENEIN number or binding affinity significantly at each time point studied compared with controls. In conclusion, CHEMICALIN may inhibit the uterine response to GENEIN by decreasing GENEIN numbers and GENEIN binding affinity, which might explain the prolonged GENEIN antagonist activity of CHEMICALIN.
15655513	Preclinical pharmacology of CHEMICALIN: a novel selective inhibitor of GENEIN. 1. This manuscript presents the preclinical profile of CHEMICALIN, a novel GENEIN (GENEIN) selective inhibitor. 2. CHEMICALIN inhibited purified GENEIN and GENEIN with K(i) values of 3 and 0.06 microM, respectively. In cellular assays, CHEMICALIN had an IC(50) of 0.14 microM in GENEIN-expressing dermal fibroblasts, but caused no inhibition of GENEIN at concentrations up to 30 microM (HEK 293 cells transfected with GENENOTIN). 3. In a human whole blood assay, IC(50) values for CHEMICALIN were 0.13 microM for GENEIN and 67 microM for GENEIN (GENEIN/GENEIN selectivity ratio 515). 4. CHEMICALNOTIN was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in rats with peak plasma levels being reached between 0.5 and 1 h. 5. Ex vivo, CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-derived CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) generation with an ID(50) of 33 mg kg(-1), whereas GENEIN-derived production of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) in the lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat air pouch was inhibited with an ID(50) value of 0.24 mg kg(-1). 6. Efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN in rat models of hyperalgesia, oedema, pyresis and arthritis was dose-dependent and similar to CHEMICALNOTIN. However, consistent with its low GENEIN inhibitory activity, CHEMICALIN at a dose of 100 mg kg(-1) orally caused no ulcers and was significantly less ulcerogenic than CHEMICALIN (P<0.05). 7. CHEMICALIN is a highly selective GENEIN inhibitor with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activities comparable with CHEMICALIN, the reference NSAID, but with much improved gastrointestinal safety.
15664409	Cloning, sequencing, structural and molecular biological characterization of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Full-length cDNAs of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were cloned by screening a human placental cDNA library, which encode a 243 amino acid protein, identical to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as confirmed by protein sequence analysis. Genomic alignment showed that the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN gene contains 9 exons. It is abundantly expressed in placenta, as numerous EST clones were identified. As CHEMICALIN metabolism deficiencies have been seen in placental infarcts previously, these indicate that GENEIN/GENEIN may have a role in placental diseases. Analysis of the 1kb promoter region showed numerous putative transcription factor binding sites, which might be responsible for the ubiquitous GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN expression. This may also be in accordance with the presence of the protein in tissues responsible for the regulation of the exquisite balance between cell division, differentiation and survival. GENENOTIN activity of the purified and recombinant protein was proved by mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization. By Western blot, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN was found in all human normal and tumorous adult and fetal tissues in nearly equal amounts, but not in sera. By immunohistochemical and immunofluorescent confocal imaging methods, diffuse labelling in the cytoplasm of the syncytiotrophoblasts and weak staining of the trophoblasts were observed, and the amount of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN decreased from the first trimester to the end of gestation. A 3D model of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN was computed (PDB No.: 1OLY) by homology modelling. A high degree of structural homology showed that the CHEMICALNOTIN binding site was highly similar to that of the mouse enzyme, but highly different from the bacterial ones. Comparison of the catalytic centre sequences revealed differences, raising the possibility of designing new drugs which specifically inhibit bacterial and fungal enzymes without affecting GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and offering the possibility for safe antimicrobial therapy during pregnancy.
15704203	Safety and tolerability of CHEMICALIN inhalation solution, a novel GENEIN agonist: results of a phase 1/phase 2 multicenter study in mild to moderate cystic fibrosis. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a selective GENEIN agonist that stimulates ciliary beat frequency and CHEMICALNOTIN secretion in normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) airway epithelia, and is being investigated as an inhaled treatment for CF. The CHEMICALIN secretory response is mediated via a non-GENEIN pathway, and the driving force for CHEMICALNOTIN secretion is enhanced by the effect of GENENOTIN activation to also inhibit epithelial CHEMICALNOTIN transport. CHEMICALIN is metabolically more stable and better tolerated, and may enhance mucociliary clearance for a longer period of time than previously investigated GENEIN agonists. The goal of this phase 1/phase 2 study was to assess the safety and tolerability of single and repeated doses of aerosolized CHEMICALNOTIN in subjects with CF. The study was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter comparison of ascending single doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (10, 20, 40, and 60 mg, administered by inhalation via the Pari LC Star nebulizer) vs. placebo (normal saline), followed by a comparison of twice-daily administration of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo for 5 days. Thirty-seven adult (18 years of age or older) and 24 pediatric (5-17 years of age) subjects with CF were evaluated in five cohorts. Subjects were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo within each cohort. The percent of subjects experiencing adverse events was similar between the CHEMICALNOTIN and placebo groups. The most common adverse event in subjects receiving CHEMICALNOTIN was chest tightness in adult subjects (39%) and cough in pediatric subjects (56%). Three (7%) subjects receiving CHEMICALNOTIN and one (7%) subject receiving placebo experienced a serious adverse event. Forced expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV(1)) profiles following dosing were similar across treatment groups, with some acute, reversible decline seen in both groups, most notably in subjects with lower lung function at baseline. In conclusion, doses up to 60 mg of CHEMICALNOTIN inhalation solution were well-tolerated in most subjects. Some intolerability was noted among subjects with lower baseline lung function. Based on the results of this phase 1/phase 2 study, the Therapeutics Development Network (TDN) of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and Inspire Pharmaceuticals, Inc., recently completed a multicenter, 28-day, phase 2 safety and efficacy clinical trial of CHEMICALNOTIN inhalation solution in CF subjects with mild lung disease.
15723099	The CHEMICALIN analog CHEMICALIN attenuates kainate-induced seizures via GENEIN activation: comparison with the effects of CHEMICALIN. In a previous study, we demonstrated that a CHEMICALNOTIN analog, CHEMICALNOTIN, has neuroprotective effects. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are high-affinity ligands at GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN has moderate affinities for CHEMICALNOTIN sites, while CHEMICALNOTIN has very low affinities for such sites, suggesting that these sites are not essential for the anticonvulsant actions of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) administration (10 mg kg(-1), i.p.) produced robust convulsions lasting 4-6 h in rats. Pre-treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN (12 or 24 mg kg(-1)) reduced seizures in a dose-dependent manner. CHEMICALIN pre-treatment also attenuated the CHEMICALIN-induced increases in GENEIN/GENEIN expression, GENEIN DNA-binding activity, and loss of cells in the CA1 and CA3 fields of the hippocampus. These effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were comparable to those of CHEMICALNOTIN. The anticonvulsant action of CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly counteracted by a selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, suggesting that the anticonvulsant action of CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN is, at least in part, related to GENEIN-activated modulation of GENEIN transcription factors. We asked whether CHEMICALNOTIN produces the behavioral side effects seen with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (a CHEMICALNOTIN-like metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN). Conditioned place preference and circling behaviors were significantly increased in mice treated with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, while mice treated with dimemorfan showed no behavioral side effects. Our results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN is equipotent to CHEMICALNOTIN in preventing CHEMICALNOTIN-induced seizures, while it may lack behavioral effects, such as psychotomimetic reactions.
15740719	Binding domains of the GENEIN for the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN in comparison to the agonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. We have analyzed binding domains of the GENEIN for CHEMICALIN, a highly selective GENEIN antagonist, in comparison to the combined GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN and the agonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. For this purpose, chimeric 'gain-in function' GENENOTIN were expressed in COS-7 cells. These recombinant receptors have been produced by transfer of domains from the GENENOTIN into the related GENENOTIN and have already been successfully employed for the identification of ligand binding domains at the GENENOTIN (Postina, R., Kojro, E., Fahrenholz, F., 1996. Separate agonist and peptide antagonist binding sites of the GENENOTIN defined by their transfer into the GENENOTIN. J. Biol. Chem. 271, 31593-31601). In displacement studies with 10 chimeric receptor constructs, the binding profile of CHEMICALNOTIN was compared with the binding profiles of the ligands CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. The binding profiles for the agonists CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were found to be similar. For both agonists, important binding domains were the extracellular CHEMICALIN-terminus (=E1) and the extracellular loops E2 and E3 from the GENEIN. For the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, none of the receptor constructs were able to provide a binding with higher affinity than the starting GENEIN. In contrast, the binding of CHEMICALIN was significantly improved when the transmembrane domains 1 and 2 were transferred from the CHEMICALNOTIN receptor to the GENEIN. The binding domain of CHEMICALIN differs from the binding domain of the agonists and the nonselective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN that has been used in previous studies. Overall, the data supported the concept of a central pocket site within the GENENOTIN.
15772097	Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy caused by mutations in the PNPO gene encoding pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase. In the mouse, neurotransmitter metabolism can be regulated by modulation of the synthesis of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and failure to maintain pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) levels results in epilepsy. This study of five patients with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy suggests that the same is true in man. Cerebrospinal fluid and urine analyses indicated reduced activity of aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and other PLP-dependent enzymes. Seizures ceased with the administration of PLP, having been resistant to treatment with pyridoxine, suggesting a defect of pyridox(am)ine 5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO). Sequencing of the PNPO gene identified homozygous missense, splice site and stop codon mutations. Expression studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells showed that the splice site (IVS3-1g>a) and stop codon (X262Q) mutations were null activity mutations and that the missense mutation (R229W) markedly reduced pyridox(am)ine phosphate oxidase activity. Maintenance of optimal PLP levels in the brain may be important in many neurological disorders in which neurotransmitter metabolism is disturbed (either as a primary or as a secondary phenomenon).
15795105	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN expression in Jurkat T cells. It has been observed that decrease of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity is associated with low content of the GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN complex of T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients. The GENENOTIN plays a pivotal role in intracellular signal transmission between GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN complex and nuclei. The compounds CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) belong to inhibitors of GENEIN, whose low activity correlates with increase in transcription of various genes. Using the reverse-transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) analysis, we indicated that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN did not profoundly affect on GENEIN transcription in Jurkat T leukemia cells clone E6-1. However, the flowcytometric analysis revealed that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN decreased intracellular contents of GENEIN in these cells in dose dependent manner. Our results suggest that decrease of GENENOTIN activity may alter intracellular signal transmission without effect on transcription level of GENENOTIN.
15805545	Changes in gene expression associated with loss of function of the NSDHL sterol dehydrogenase in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Seven human disorders of postsqualene cholesterol biosynthesis have been described. One of these, congenital hemidysplasia with ichthyosiform nevus and limb defects (CHILD) syndrome, results from mutations in the X-linked gene NADH sterol dehydrogenase-like (NSDHL) encoding a sterol dehydrogenase. A series of mutant alleles of the murine Nsdhl gene are carried by bare patches (Bpa) mice, with Bpa(1H) representing a null allele. Heterozygous Bpa(1H) females display skin and skeletal abnormalities in a distribution reflecting random X inactivation, whereas hemizygous male embryos die before embryonic day 10.5. To investigate the molecular basis of defects associated with perturbations in cholesterol biosynthesis, microarray analysis was performed comparing gene expression in embryonic fibroblasts expressing the Bpa(1H) allele versus wild-type (wt) cells. Labeled cDNAs from cells grown in normal serum or lipid-depleted serum (LDS) were hybridized to microarrays containing 22,000 mouse genes. Among 44 genes that showed higher expression in the Bpa(1H) versus wt cells grown in LDS, 11 function in cholesterol biosynthesis, 7 are involved in fatty acid synthesis, 3 (Srebp2, Insig1, and Orf11) encode sterol-regulatory proteins, and 2 (Ldlr and StarD4) are lipid transporters. Of the 21 remaining genes, 16 are known genes, some of which have been implicated previously in cholesterol homeostasis or lipid-mediated signaling, and 5 are uncharacterized cDNA clones.
15866500	Rapid quantitation of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN by high-performance liquid chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry and its application to pharmacodynamic studies in cancer patients. A novel method employing high-performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed and validated for the quantitation of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). It involves a plasma clean-up step with strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction (SAX-SPE) followed by HPLC separation and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry detection (APCI-MS) in a selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The ionization conditions were optimised in negative ion mode to give the best intensity of the dominant CHEMICALNOTIN adduct [M+CHEMICALNOTIN]- at m/z 273. Retention times were 7.5 and 12.5 min for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, an iodinated analogue internal standard (IS), respectively. Peak area ratios of CHEMICALNOTIN to IS were used for regression analysis of the calibration curve. The latter was linear from 5 to 400 nmol/l using 1 ml sample volume of plasma. The average recovery was 81.5% and 78.6% for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. The method provides sufficient sensitivity, precision, accuracy and selectivity for routine analysis of human plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentration with the lowest limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 5 nmol/l. Clinical studies in cancer patients treated with the new CHEMICALIN analogue CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) have shown that plasma CHEMICALIN was significantly elevated after 1 week of treatment, consistent with inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN). These findings suggest that the mechanism of antiproliferative toxicity of CHEMICALIN is at least partly due to GENEIN inhibitory activity of its active metabolite CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Monitoring of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations have the potential to help clinicians to guide scheduling of CHEMICALNOTIN or other GENENOTIN inhibitors in clinical trials. Marked differences of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN between human and rodents have also been confirmed. In conclusion, the LC-MS method developed is simple, highly selective and sensitive and permits pharmacodynamic studies of GENENOTIN inhibitors in several species.
15887238	Induction of GENEIN and activation of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN-treated squamous carcinoma cells. CHEMICALIN is a GENEIN inhibitor of the GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), and GENEIN GENEIN. Inhibition of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN accounts for its clinical activity in leukemia and sarcoma, respectively. In this report, we describe other cellular targets for CHEMICALNOTIN. Treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cells with clinically relevant concentrations of CHEMICALIN-induced changes in cell morphology and growth similar to changes associated with GENEIN (GENEIN) activation. CHEMICALIN-induced changes were blocked with the GENENOTIN antagonist cetuximab, which suggested direct involvement of GENEIN in this process. Western blot analysis of cells incubated with CHEMICALIN demonstrated activation of GENEIN and downstream signaling that was reduced by inhibition of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN, but not GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN. An in vitro GENENOTIN assay showed that CHEMICALIN did not directly affect GENEIN GENEIN activity, suggesting involvement of GENEIN-activating molecules. Inhibitors and neutralizing antibodies against GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and to a lesser extent GENENOTIN, reduced CHEMICALIN-mediated GENEIN (GENEIN) activation. CHEMICALIN stimulated the rapid release of soluble GENEIN and the subsequent induction of membrane-bound GENEIN, which correlated with biphasic GENEIN activation. Together, these results suggested that CHEMICALIN affects GENEIN activation and signaling pathways through rapid release and increased expression of endogenous GENEIN-activating ligands. Although, CHEMICALIN primarily inhibits GENEIN, it also stimulates the activity of GENEIN GENEIN in head and neck squamous tumors. This finding demonstrates the need for careful use of this drug in cancer patients.
15894928	Epithelioid gastrointestinal stromal tumor with GENENOTIN activating mutation and immunoreactivity. The authors report a unique case of an intra-abdominal, epithelioid mesenchymal tumor that had an activating mutation of GENENOTIN and a strong GENENOTIN immunoreactivity but lacked both GENENOTIN mutation and GENENOTIN protein (GENENOTIN) expression. IHC study showed that the tumor cells were diffusely and strongly positive for GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN but completely negative for GENENOTIN as well as for muscle, epithelial, endothelial, endocrine, mesothelial, neural, and melanocytic cell markers. Molecular study revealed a mutation at the juxtamembrane domain of exon 12 in GENENOTIN gene with GENENOTIN transition at codon 561 (GENENOTIN), as shown in the previous mutational studies on gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This case likely represents an example of GIST with GENENOTIN activating mutation and GENENOTIN immunoreactivity without GENENOTIN positivity, which has not been documented in the literature. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN]) might be an effective therapy in this case, since CHEMICALIN targets both GENEIN and GENEIN oncoproteins.
1590750	Genetic polymorphism and activities of GENENOTIN: implications for CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism and cytotoxicity. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) exhibit genetic polymorphism and tissue specificity. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN isozyme phenotypes from 39 surgical Chinese lung specimens were identified by agarose isoelectric focusing. The identity of the lung GENEIN was further demonstrated by their characteristic pH-activity profiles for CHEMICALIN oxidation, Km values for NAD and CHEMICALIN, and inhibition by CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. The beta 2 allele, coding for beta 2 CHEMICALNOTIN, was found to be predominant in the lung specimens studied. The GENENOTIN activities in the lungs with the homozygous phenotype GENENOTIN (exhibiting beta 2 beta 2) and GENENOTIN (exhibiting beta 1 beta 1) and the heterozygous phenotype GENENOTIN (exhibiting beta 2 beta 2, beta 2 beta 1, and beta 1 beta 1) were determined to be 999 +/- 77, 48 +/- 17, and 494 +/- 61 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. Fifty-one percent of the specimens studied lacked the GENENOTIN activity band on the isoelectric focusing gels. The activities in the lung tissues with the GENENOTIN-active phenotype and the inactive phenotype were determined to be 30 +/- 3 and 17 +/- 1 nmol/min/g tissue, respectively. These findings indicate that human pulmonary CHEMICALIN-metabolizing activities differ significantly with respect to genetic polymorphism at both the GENEIN and the GENEIN loci. The results suggest that individuals with high Vmax GENEIN and deficient in low-Km mitochondrial GENEIN, accounting for approximately 45% of the Chinese population, may end up with CHEMICALIN accumulation during CHEMICALIN consumption, rendering them vulnerable to tissue injury caused by this highly reactive and toxic metabolite.
15936988	CHEMICALIN induces GENEIN production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The effects of statins on immune response depend on the inhibition of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, which is a ligand of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN inhibitor with mild inhibition of GENEIN, induced the production of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). The GENEIN production is located upstream of the GENEIN cascade activated by CHEMICALIN. Moreover, CHEMICALIN concentration-dependently inhibited the expression of GENEIN and induced the expression of GENEIN on monocytes. In the presence of GENEIN, CHEMICALIN suppressed the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN as well as the production of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in PBMC, contributing to the anti-inflammatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were abolished by the addition of the product of the GENEIN, CHEMICALIN, indicating the involvement of GENEIN in the action of CHEMICALIN.
15939622	GENEIN and GENEIN inhibition in horse blood by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN: an in vitro analysis. We report on the inhibitory activity of the NSAIDs CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, on blood GENEIN in the horse using in vitro enzyme-linked assays. As expected, comparison of IC50 indicated that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are more selective inhibitors of GENEIN than CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALNOTIN was the most advantageous for horses of four NSAIDs examined. However at IC80, CHEMICALIN (+134.4%) and CHEMICALIN (+29.7%) had greater GENEIN selectivity than at IC50, and CHEMICALIN (-41.2%) and CHEMICALIN (-12.9%) had lower GENEIN selectivity than at IC50. We therefore propose that the selectivity of NSAIDs should be assessed at the 80% as well as 50% inhibition level.
15942707	CHEMICALIN prevents cardiac hypertrophy and overexpression of GENEIN and GENEIN in pressure-overloaded rat heart. The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for cardiac hypertrophy. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of GENENOTIN in cardiac hypertrophy due to pressure overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. To evaluate the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on both myocardial GENENOTIN expression and cardiac hypertrophy, infra-renal aortic banding was performed for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce cardiac hypertrophy. CHEMICALNOTIN at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. Heart weight and the ratio of heart weight and body weight increased significantly after aortic banding for 4 weeks in the absence of drug treatment. Mean arterial pressure increased from 80 +/- 9 mmHg in the sham group to 94 +/-5 mmHg (p < 0.001) in the banding group. Echocardiography showed concentric hypertrophy after aortic banding. Mean arterial pressure decreased after treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN. The increased wall thickness and heart weight was reversed to normal by CHEMICALNOTIN. Western blot showed that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) proteins were up-regulated and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) down-regulated in the banding group. Treatment with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN did not significantly affect GENEIN and GENEIN proteins expression in the banding groups. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN increased and mRNA of GENENOTIN decreased in the banding group. Treatment with CHEMICALIN reversed both protein and mRNA of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the banding group and CHEMICALIN again normalized the labeling. In conclusion, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA and protein expression were up-regulated, while GENENOTIN mRNA and protein was downregulated in the rat model of pressure-overloaded cardiac hypertrophy. Treatment with CHEMICALIN is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN in the hypertrophic myocardium.
15946589	CHEMICALNOTIN resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs are ineffective in treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN; Novartis Pharmaceuticals, East Hanover, NJ), a selective inhibitor of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN-GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN represents a new paradigm of targeted cancer therapy and has revolutionized the treatment of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia and GISTs. Unfortunately, CHEMICALNOTIN resistance has emerged. The reported mechanism of CHEMICALIN resistance in GISTs involves missense mutation in the GENEIN of GENEIN including GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. The established mechanisms and potential mechanisms of CHEMICALNOTIN resistance in GISTs, the imaging studies indicative of early development of CHEMICALNOTIN resistance, and the management of CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant GISTs are discussed.
15947036	Evaluation of GENENOTIN ligands at the GENENOTIN: identification of CHEMICALIN as the first potent and selective GENEIN agonist. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is involved in the chemotaxis of leukocytes and mast cells to sites of inflammation and is suggested to be a potential drug target for asthma and allergy. So far, selective GENENOTIN agonists have not been identified. In the present study, we therefore evaluated the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) for its interaction with various known histaminergic ligands. Almost all of the tested GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN antagonists, including several important therapeutics, displaced less than 30% of specific CHEMICALIN binding to the GENEIN at concentrations up to 10 microM. Most of the tested GENENOTIN agonists and CHEMICALIN-based GENEIN ligands show micromolar-to-nanomolar range GENEIN affinity, and these ligands exert different intrinsic GENEIN activities, ranging from full agonists to inverse agonists. Interestingly, we identified CHEMICALIN as a high-affinity GENEIN ligand (K(i) = 50 nM) that has a >100-fold selectivity for the GENEIN over the other GENEIN subtypes. Moreover, CHEMICALIN potently activated the GENEIN (pEC(50) = 7.4 +/- 0.1; alpha = 1), and this response was competitively antagonized by the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN] (pA(2) = 7.8). The identification of CHEMICALIN as a potent GENEIN agonist is of major importance for future studies to unravel the physiological roles of the GENEIN.
15975002	Novel agents that potentially inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN-induced diarrhea. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) has exhibited clinical activities against a broad spectrum of carcinomas by inhibiting GENEIN (GENEIN). However, severe and unpredictable dosing-limiting toxicities (mainly myelosuppression and severe diarrhea) hinder its clinical use. The latter consists of early and late-onset diarrhea, occurring within 24 hr or > or = 24 hr after CHEMICALNOTIN administration, respectively. This review highlights novel agents potentially inhibiting CHEMICALNOTIN-induced diarrhea, which are designed and tested under guidance of disposition pathways and potential toxicity mechanisms. Early-onset diarrhea is observed immediately after CHEMICALIN infusion and probably due to the inhibition of GENEIN activity, which can be eliminated by administration of CHEMICALIN. Late-onset diarrhea appears to be associated with intestinal exposure to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), the major active metabolite of CHEMICALIN, which may bind to GENEIN and induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelia, leading to the disturbance in the absorptive and secretory functions of mucosa. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN may also stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory GENEIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), thus inducing the secretion of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Early treatment of severe late-onset diarrhea with oral high-dose CHEMICALNOTIN has decreased patient morbidity. Extensive studies have been conducted to identify other potential agents to ameliorate diarrhea in preclinical and clinical models. These include intestinal alkalizing agents, oral antibiotics, enzyme inducers, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, or blockers of biliary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular targets associated with CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity and safe and effective agents for alleviating CHEMICALNOTIN-induced diarrhea.
15985434	Crystal structure of GENEIN in complex with CHEMICALIN and derivatives. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyzes the phosphorylation of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN in the presence of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. This constitutes an essential step in the synthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), the active form of CHEMICALNOTIN, a cofactor for over 140 enzymes. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is a relatively selective inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN), currently evaluated for the treatment of cancers, neurodegenerative disorders, renal diseases, and several viral infections. Affinity chromatography investigations have shown that CHEMICALIN also interacts with GENEIN. To understand this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of GENEIN in complex with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, the two latter derivatives being designed to bind to GENEIN but not to GENEIN. Structural analysis revealed that these three CHEMICALIN bind similarly in the CHEMICALIN-binding site of GENEIN rather than in the anticipated CHEMICALIN-binding site. The CHEMICALNOTIN pocket has thus an unexpected ability to accommodate molecules different from and larger than CHEMICALNOTIN. This work provides detailed structural information on the interactions between GENEIN and CHEMICALIN and analogs. It could also aid in the design of CHEMICALIN derivatives displaying strict selectivity for either GENEIN or GENEIN.
15985706	GENENOTIN secretion in response to GENENOTIN activation is mediated by GENENOTIN GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN transactivation. In many systems, the integration of converging regulatory signals that relay on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation into functional cellular pathways requires the involvement of GENENOTIN. In this report, we provide evidence that activation of GENENOTIN by beta-adrenergic agonist leading to stimulation in GENENOTIN secretion requires GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) participation. Using CHEMICALNOTIN-labeled gastric mucosal cells, we show that stimulatory effect of beta-adrenergic agonist, isoproterenol, on GENEIN secretion was inhibited by GENEIN GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, as well as CHEMICALIN, a specific inhibitor of GENEIN. Both inhibitors, moreover, blunted the GENEIN secretory responses to beta-adrenergic agonist-generated second messenger, CHEMICALIN as well as GENEIN activator, CHEMICALIN. The GENEIN secretory responses to CHEMICALIN, furthermore, were inhibited by CHEMICALIN, a selective inhibitor of GENEIN GENEIN responsible for ligand-independent GENEIN autophosphorylation, but not by GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. The inhibition of GENEIN, moreover, did not cause attenuation in GENEIN secretion in response to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. The findings underline the role of GENENOTIN as a convergence point in GENENOTIN secretion triggered by GENENOTIN activation, and demonstrate the requirement for GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN transactivation.
15991937	CHEMICALIN: a selective GENEIN antagonist for the treatment of heart failure. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is the prototype of a new class of potent and selective GENEIN antagonists with the largest published preclinical and clinical data base. Since all of the CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists are selective for the GENENOTIN, these drugs should exhibit similar cardiovascular effects. However, since the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles of these agents and their degree of affinity for the GENENOTIN differ, it is likely that differences in clinical profiles between these drugs exist and will require investigation. CHEMICALIN (parent compound), has moderate affinity for the GENEIN (competitive inhibition). CHEMICALIN is well-absorbed orally as an active drug and is rapidly converted via oxidation in the human liver to a more potent metabolite (designated E3174) with an affinity 20- to 30-times greater for the GENEIN (non-competitive inhibition). E3174 has a half-life of 6 - 9 h; elimination is via renal and hepatic routes. Antihypertensive and, in heart failure patients, haemodynamic activity is observed over a 24 h period with once daily dosing. Over 6 million patients have been treated for hypertension with continued excellent tolerability. Clinical experience in heart failure is growing, and recent data suggest an improved survival with CHEMICALIN versus CHEMICALIN, a drug from the GENEIN inhibitor class with proven benefit in this population. The current comprehensive CHEMICALNOTIN clinical end-point programme (4 large scale morbidity/mortality trials) should provide evidence regarding the efficacy of direct blockade of the GENEIN with CHEMICALIN compared to standard therapy: 1) The CHEMICALNOTIN Heart Failure Survival Study - ELITE II, 2) The CHEMICALNOTIN Post-Myocardial Infarction Survival Study - OPTIMAAL, 3) The CHEMICALNOTIN Hypertension Survival Study - LIFE and 4) The CHEMICALNOTIN Renal Protection Study - RENAAL.
1611705	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN production in endotoxic shock. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a macrophage-derived mediator responsible for many of the pathophysiologic manifestations of endotoxic shock. We now demonstrate that CHEMICALIN, a noncatechol inotrope, strongly inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced GENEIN production at concentrations readily achieved in vivo. This inhibition is apparent in murine macrophages, in macrophage cell lines, in vivo, and in cell lines containing a reporter gene construct that substitutes the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) coding sequence for the GENENOTIN coding sequence and introns. Inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN (like inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN) is manifested at the level of mRNA accumulation, in contrast to inhibition caused by CHEMICALNOTIN. Combined application of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN caused additive inhibition of GENEIN biosynthesis in vitro. Furthermore, treatment of mice with CHEMICALNOTIN immediately prior to endotoxin challenge led to significantly improved survival. These findings suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN possesses antiinflammatory as well as inotropic properties that may make it an appropriate agent for use in septic shock or other serious bacterial infections. Abrupt removal of CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN from the culture medium prior to LPS stimulation, however, caused significantly augmented GENEIN production. Therefore, CHEMICALNOTIN and other GENENOTIN inhibitors may also enhance sensitivity to LPS during a period of time following discontinuation of therapy.
16207494	Age-dependent changes of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesizing enzymes immunoreactivities and activities in the gerbil hippocampal CA1 region. In the present study, age-related changes of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) synthesizing enzymes, GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN), their protein contents and activities were examined in the gerbil hippocampus proper. Significant age-dependent changes in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN immunoreactivities were found in the CA1 region, but not in the CA2/3 region. In the postnatal month 1 (PM 1) group, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN immunoreactivities were detected mainly in the stratum pyramidale of the CA1 region. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN immunoreactivities and their protein contents were highest in the PM 6 group, showing that many CA1 pyramidal cells had strong GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN immunoreactivities. Thereafter, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN immunoreactivities started to decrease and were very low at PM 24. Alterations in the change patterns in protein contents and total activities of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN corresponded to the immunohistochemical data, but their specific activities were not altered in any experimental group. Based on double immunofluorescence study, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN immunoreactive cells in the strata oriens and radiatum were identified as GABAergic cells. Therefore, decreases of GENEIN and GENEIN in the hippocampal CA1 region of aged brains may be involved in aging processes related with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) function.
16213084	Functional characteristics of CHEMICALNOTIN -dependent CHEMICALNOTIN transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. In the present study, we report the characteristics of CHEMICALNOTIN-coupled CHEMICALNOTIN transport in primary cultures of astrocytes from rat cerebral cortex. The CHEMICALNOTIN transport in rat astrocytes increased up to a pH 5.5. The CHEMICALNOTIN uptake at pH 6.0 was both energy-dependent and saturable with a Michaelis constant (K(t)) of 2.8+/-0.4 mM and the maximal uptake rate (V(max)) of 31+/-3.2 nmol/mg protein/10 min. This process was reduced by a protonophore, CHEMICALNOTIN, and a typical GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, suggesting that CHEMICALIN uptake by rat astrocytes is mediated by CHEMICALIN-coupled GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN transport in rat astrocytes was significantly inhibited by various CHEMICALNOTIN such as CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN with a relatively low affinity (K(i)>10 mM). On the other hand, the uptake process of CHEMICALNOTIN was also saturable with a high-affinity component (K(t)=0.27 mM) and a low-affinity component (K(t)=35.9 mM). Reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot analyses revealed that three GENENOTIN subtypes, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, were expressed in these cells. Because CHEMICALNOTIN reduced to 67% of the CHEMICALNOTIN uptake even at 10mM, it is unlikely that CHEMICALIN uptake in rat astrocytes is mediated by GENEIN and/or GENEIN. These results provide biochemical evidence of a CHEMICALIN-coupled and saturable transport system, presumed to be a GENEIN GENEIN or other unknown GENEIN, for CHEMICALIN in rat cerebrocortical astrocytes.
16220064	A review of the structural and functional features of CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN blocker. The GENEIN-mediated effects of CHEMICALIN play a key role in the pathophysiology of hypertension. Effective inhibition of GENENOTIN is provided by the latest class of antihypertensive medications, the GENENOTIN receptor blockers (ARBs). These orally available agents were developed around a common imidazole-based structural core. The most recent member of this drug class to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration, CHEMICALNOTIN, contains unique features that may explain its clinical efficacy. Key structural elements of CHEMICALNOTIN include a hydroxyalkyl substituent at the imidazole 4-position and a hydrolyzable ester group at the imidazole 5-position. Inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonding involving these groups may contribute to the potentiation of antagonist activity. After oral administration, CHEMICALNOTIN is deesterified in the intestinal tract to produce the active metabolite olmesartan, which undergoes no additional metabolic change. The marked antihypertensive efficacy of CHEMICALIN may result from a unique pharmacological interaction of the drug with the GENEIN receptor, resulting in a potent, long-lasting, dose-dependent blockade of GENEIN. This review article characterizes the structural features of olmesartan that may be responsible for its clinical efficacy. Inferential pharmacological studies compare and contrast the effects of olmesartan to those of other ARBs in comparable preclinical animal models.
16245075	Effects of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) on acid-induced lung injury in rats. It has been suggested that neutrophils play an important role in acid-aspirated lung injury. We examined the effects of the high dose of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which is capable of increasing peripheral neutrophils, and a specific GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) on acid lung injury in rats. Animals were anesthetized and normal saline (NS, 2 mL kg(-1)) or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.1 N 2 mL kg(-1)) was then instilled into trachea. Thirty minutes before CHEMICALNOTIN instillation, GENENOTIN (150 microg kg(-1)) was injected subcutaneously or CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg kg(-1) h(-1)) was infused continuously into the right jugular vein. Animals were ventilated during the experiments. Five hours after CHEMICALNOTIN or NS instillation, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and lung tissue samples were obtained. Total nuclear cell count, absorbance, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN in BALF, wet-to-dry (W/D) ratio were measured. CHEMICALNOTIN aspiration markedly increased these values in BALF and W/D ratio. Both CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN attenuated the parameters increased by acid-induced lung injury in rats. The data suggests that neutrophils play an important role in acid-induced lung injury. However, high-dose GENENOTIN does not exacerbate acid-aspirated lung injury in rats, although this agent causes an increase in peripheral neutrophils.
16247743	Guidance on the use of CHEMICALNOTIN for treating patients with type 1 Gaucher disease. Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD) is a progressive lysosomal storage disorder due to an autosomal recessive deficiency of GENENOTIN. Clinical manifestations include anemia, thrombocytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone and pulmonary disease. Intravenous enzyme replacement (ERT) with imiglucerase is the accepted standard for treatment of symptomatic patients. More than 3,500 patients worldwide have received ERT with well-documented beneficial effects on the hematological, visceral, skeletal, and pulmonary manifestations, and with resultant improvement in health-related quality of life. CHEMICALIN, an CHEMICALIN that reversibly inhibits GENEIN and reduces intracellular substrate burden, is an oral treatment for patients with type 1 GD that was recently approved in the United States for symptomatic patients with mild to moderate clinical manifestations for whom ERT is not an option. Because responses to CHEMICALNOTIN are slower and less robust than those observed with ERT, and because CHEMICALNOTIN is associated with significant side effects, clinicians who care for patients with GD should become familiar with the limited indications for CHEMICALNOTIN use and the circumstances when it may be prescribed appropriately. This review article and position statement represents the current opinion of American physicians with extensive expertise in GD regarding patient management in the context of the availability of standard imiglucerase treatment and the recent introduction of CHEMICALNOTIN.
16248990	GENEIN potentiator drugs, huprine X and CHEMICALIN, increase CHEMICALNOTIN release by blocking GENEIN activity but not acting on GENEIN. The main goal of the present study was to analyse the effects of (+/-)-huprine X ((+/-)-HX) and galantamine (GAL), with potentiating action on GENENOTIN, and huperzine A (HPA), devoid of nicotinic activity, on CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) release in striatal slices of rat brain. All compounds are non-covalent and reversible inhibitors of GENENOTIN. Addition of (+/-)-HX (0.01 microM), GAL (10 microM) and HPA (0.1 microM) to the superfusion medium decreased the release of the CHEMICALNOTIN neurotransmitter to a similar extent: 36%, 30% and 34%, respectively (P<0.01). This effect was reverted in the presence of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; 0.1 microM), which blocks the pre-synaptic GENEIN. After that, a wide range of concentrations of drugs, concomitantly with CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1 microM), was studied in the presence of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; 0.01 microM), a GENEIN antagonist. In these conditions, a dose-dependent increase of CHEMICALNOTIN release was observed in the presence of (+/-)-HX, GAL and HPA. To test the role of GENEIN in the drugs' effects on CHEMICALNOTIN release, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) 100 microM was used to block such receptors. CHEMICALNOTIN alone significantly decreased neurotransmitter release by 18% (P<0.05), but no change was obtained in the presence of both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Under these conditions, (+/-)-HX, GAL and HPA increased the release of CHEMICALNOTIN by 37%, 25% and 38%, respectively (P<0.01). Taking into account all of these data, the present results suggest that the effects induced by (+/-)-HX and GAL GENENOTIN potentiators seem to be mainly due to their ability in inhibiting GENENOTIN activity, but not by interaction on the GENENOTIN.
16253547	Rat hepatic stellate cells become CHEMICALNOTIN unresponsive during activation. Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) play an essential role in fibrogenesis. Many stimuli cause HSC to activate, lose their CHEMICALNOTIN and produce GENENOTIN. It is unclear whether CHEMICALNOTIN loss causes activation, potentiates it or is simply an event in the cascade of activation changes. We determine if exogenous CHEMICALNOTIN prevent the activation of freshly isolated rat HSC activated by plating on plastic. We also determine if CHEMICALNOTIN: (1) reverse HSC activation; (2) maintain/restore HSC intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels; (3) maintain expression of HSC GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in HSC that are becoming activated or are chronically activated. Markers of activation in freshly isolated HSC were decreased by either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN without increases in HSC CHEMICALNOTIN concentration. mRNA levels for GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN, the GENEIN for CHEMICALIN, decreased during activation of freshly isolated HSC even with CHEMICALIN supplementation. GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA and GENENOTIN protein was undetectable in chronically activated HSC and remained absent after CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation. Activation markers in chronically activated HSC were only slightly decreased after CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. We conclude that exposure of HSC to extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN diminishes some markers of activation but does not prevent HSC activation.
16324695	GENENOTIN potentiates homologous desensitization of the GENENOTIN in bovine tracheal smooth muscle. Preincubation (30 min) of bovine tracheal smooth muscle with various concentrations (0.1, 1 and 10 microM) of CHEMICALIN decreased CHEMICALIN-induced maximal relaxation (E(max)) of CHEMICALIN-contracted preparations in a concentration dependent fashion, indicating desensitization of the GENEIN. Preincubation with 1 microM of the GENEIN (GENEIN) activator CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) caused a small but significant decrease in CHEMICALIN-induced E(max), indicating activated GENEIN-mediated heterologous GENEIN desensitization. To investigate the capacity of activated GENENOTIN to regulate homologous desensitization, we incubated the smooth muscle strips with the combination of both 1 microM PMA and 1 microM CHEMICALNOTIN. This combined treatment synergistically decreased the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced maximal relaxation, as compared to the individual effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN alone, indicating a common pathway for heterologous and homologous desensitization. Moreover, the specific GENEIN-inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) markedly increased the potency and E(max) of CHEMICALNOTIN for all conditions used, including control conditions, and the synergistic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were completely prevented. In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that homologous desensitization of the GENENOTIN can be enhanced by GENENOTIN activation. For the first time we have provided evidence that this concept is functionally operative in airway smooth muscle, and it may explain the reduced bronchodilator response to GENENOTIN agonists in patients with asthma during a severe exacerbation.
16336752	Overview of monoclonal antibodies and small molecules targeting the GENENOTIN pathway in colorectal cancer. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) provides survival signals and is overexpressed in the majority of colorectal cancers. As more is learned about the molecular details of GENENOTIN signaling, antibodies can be designed to interfere with specific domains of the GENENOTIN molecule. In this review, we analyze preclinical and current clinical data on GENENOTIN-targeting molecules and their potential role in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Cetuximab binds to domain III of GENENOTIN and hinders ligand binding. It is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for metastatic colorectal cancer treatment. Panitumumab is another widely studied anti-GENENOTIN antibody with similar properties. Bispecific antibodies are modified GENENOTIN molecules containing 2 different binding specificities. These antibodies can redirect the immune response against tumor cells by tethering effector cells such as GENENOTIN-expressing T cells or GENENOTIN-expressing natural killer cells and granulocytes to the surface of cancer cells. GENEIN inhibitors are CHEMICALIN-derived, low molecular weight synthetic molecules that can block the intracellular GENEIN of several receptors, including GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, and thereby inhibit ligand-induced receptor phosphorylation and abrogate the biologic effect of GENEIN signaling. The presence of skin rash and GENENOTIN gene amplification have been advanced as possible predictors of clinical effectiveness of targeted anti-GENENOTIN therapies.
16373326	Isolation and function of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) from rabbit and discrimination between transport via GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Reabsorption of CHEMICALNOTIN is an important function of the renal proximal tubule. pH-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN transport has been measured previously using rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles (BBMV). The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether this pH-dependent uptake represents CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN cotransport via a GENENOTIN-like transport system. The GENENOTIN cDNA was isolated (2296bp including both 5' and 3' untranslated regions and GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN codes for a protein of 475 CHEMICALIN (92% identity to GENEIN). GENENOTIN mRNA was found in all tissues investigated including kidney. When expressed heterologously in a mammalian cell line, GENEIN mediates pH-dependent, CHEMICALIN-independent uptake of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN uptake was maximal at pH 5.0 (K(m) 2.2+/-0.7 mM). A transport system with identical characteristics (ion dependency, substrate specificity) was detected in rabbit renal BBMV where an overshoot was observed in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN but in the presence of an inwardly directed CHEMICALNOTIN gradient. In the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and under conditions in which GENEIN transport function was suppressed, a second CHEMICALIN uptake system was detected that exhibited functional characteristics similar to those of the GENENOTIN. The functional characteristics of GENENOTIN in either mammalian cells or renal BBMV suggest that GENEIN is the low-affinity transporter of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN believed to be defective in patients with iminoglycinuria.
16388933	Antidepressants suppress production of the Th1 GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, independent of GENENOTIN blockade. In this study, antidepressants with selectivity for the GENEIN (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN), or the GENEIN (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) were examined in terms of their ability to promote an anti-inflammatory GENENOTIN phenotype in human blood. In addition, we examined the ability of CHEMICALNOTIN; a CHEMICALNOTIN antidepressant that is devoid of CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitory properties on GENENOTIN production. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was used to stimulate monocyte-derived pro-inflammatory (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) and anti-inflammatory (GENENOTIN) GENENOTIN, whilst concanavalin A (Con A) was used to stimulate T-cell (Th(1): GENENOTIN and Th(2/3): GENENOTIN) GENENOTIN. All of the antidepressants suppressed GENENOTIN production in the 10-50 microM concentration range, irrespective of their preference for GENENOTIN. This suppression of GENENOTIN production was paralleled by reduced T-cell proliferation, therefore we suggest that the ability of antidepressants to suppress GENENOTIN production may be related to their anti-proliferative properties. The fact that CHEMICALIN also suppressed GENEIN production and T-cell proliferation indicates that these immunomodulatory actions of antidepressants are most likely unrelated to inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake. Interestingly, exposure to a lower concentration (1 microM) of the antidepressants tended to increase T-cell-derived GENEIN production, with significant effects elicited by the CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. In contrast to the robust actions of antidepressants on T-cell derived GENENOTIN production, they failed to induce any consistent change in LPS-induced monocyte GENENOTIN production. Overall, our results indicate that GENENOTIN producing T-cells (Th(1) cells) are the major target for the immunomodulatory actions of antidepressants, and provide evidence questioning the relationship between the monoaminergic reuptake properties of antidepressants and their immunomodulatory effects. The potential clinical significance of the anti-inflammatory actions of antidepressants is discussed.
16418149	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on serum GENENOTIN levels. GENEIN is a 167 CHEMICALIN protein encoded by the obesity gene that is synthesized in adipose tissue and interacts with receptors in the hypothalamus linked to the regulation of appetite and metabolism. It is known to suppress appetite and increase energy expenditure. CHEMICALIN is a CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN that increases appetite through its antiserotonergic effect on GENEIN receptors in the brain. Although both GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are effective in controlling appetite, their interaction has not been addressed in clinical studies. This study evaluated serum leptin concentrations in patients who received CHEMICALNOTIN to treat a variety of disorders. Sixteen patients aged 7 to 71 years (mean, 26.25 years) were given CHEMICALNOTIN 2 to 6 mg/day for a minimum of 7 days. Body weight was measured and blood samples were obtained at baseline and after 1 week of treatment. Serum GENENOTIN levels were determined by GENENOTIN radioimmunoassay. The mean body weight at baseline (52.59 kg) did not differ significantly from that at 1 week after treatment (52.84 kg; P > .05), but the mean GENEIN level after 1 week of treatment with CHEMICALIN (3.14 ng/mL) was 14.2% higher than that at baseline (2.75 ng/mL; P < .05). This increase may suggest that both GENEIN and CHEMICALIN may affect appetite via similar receptors and that CHEMICALNOTIN does not impair leptin activity through these receptors. Further study will be necessary to clarify this relationship.
16424790	Comparison of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN to study the role of the CHEMICALIN-group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with GENEIN inhibitors in high dieted CHEMICALNOTIN mice. To examine the role of CHEMICALNOTIN (-CHEMICALNOTIN) group in improvement of endothelial dysfunction with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors in experimental high dose of CHEMICALNOTIN dieted rats. We compared the effects of CHEMICALIN (an GENEIN inhibitor with -CHEMICALIN group), CHEMICALIN (an GENEIN-inhibitor without -CHEMICALNOTIN group), CHEMICALIN (only -CHEMICALNOTIN group not GENEIN inhibitor) on endothelial dysfunction injured by CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) in rats. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into seven groups: control group, CHEMICALNOTIN group, low dose CHEMICALNOTIN (15 mg/kg), middle dose CHEMICALNOTIN (30 mg/kg), high dose CHEMICALNOTIN (45 mg/kg), CHEMICALNOTIN (20 mg/kg), CHEMICALNOTIN (200 mg/kg); control group were intragastric gavaged by water and others groups were intragastric gavaged by CHEMICALNOTIN and drugs in water one time every day. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation (EDR), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced endothelium-independent relaxation of aortic rings were examined. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN activity, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in serum were analyzed. It was found that a single intragastric gavage by CHEMICALIN resulted in inhibition of endothelium-dependent relaxation, markedly increased the serum level of CHEMICALNOTIN and decreased the activity of GENEIN and GENEIN, similarly decreased the level of CHEMICALNOTIN in the serum; but had no effects on endothelium-independent relaxation and GENEIN activity compared with the control group. Given the treatment with three doses of CHEMICALIN (15 approximately 45 mg/kg) markedly attenuated inhibition of vasodilator responses to CHEMICALNOTIN, and eliminated the increased level of CHEMICALNOTIN, the decreased level of CHEMICALNOTIN, activity of GENEIN and GENEIN in serum by single intragastric gavaged CHEMICALNOTIN. However, there were some significant differences among CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg or 45 mg/kg), CHEMICALIN (20 mg/kg), and CHEMICALIN particular in the activity of GENEIN and GENEIN. These results suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN can protect the vascular endothelium against the damages induced by CHEMICALIN in rats, and the beneficial effects of CHEMICALIN may be related to attenuating the decrease in GENEIN activity and CHEMICALNOTIN levels. Furthermore, this protective effect may be concerned with the CHEMICALNOTIN group.
16474853	Preclinical and clinical development of the oral multikinase inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN in cancer treatment. Tumor survival, growth and metastasis depend on efficient tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis, and targeting both of these processes simultaneously could prove to be therapeutically relevant. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling pathway is an important mediator of tumor cell proliferation, and angiogenesis and is often aberrantly activated in human tumors due to the presence of activated GENENOTIN or mutant GENENOTIN, or elevation of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN, which belongs chemically to a class that can be described as CHEMICALIN, was selected for further pharmacologic characterization based on potent inhibition of GENEIN and its favorable GENEIN selectivity profile. Further characterization showed that CHEMICALIN suppresses both wild-type and GENEIN mutant GENEIN activity in vitro. In addition, CHEMICALIN demonstrated significant activity against several GENEIN involved in neovascularization and tumor progression, including GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN GENEIN, and GENEIN. Preclinically, CHEMICALNOTIN showed broad-spectrum antitumor activity in colon, breast and non-small-cell lung cancer xenograft models. A total of four phase I studies using oral CHEMICALNOTIN as a single agent have been completed, and the compound showed a favorable safety profile with mild to moderate diarrhea being the most common treatment-related adverse event. The maximum tolerated dose was 400 mg b.i.d. continuous. Single-agent phase II trials reported so far demonstrated antitumor activity of CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, sarcoma and renal cell cancer (RCC). Based on phase II results in RCC patients, a placebo-controlled phase III study was performed, which randomized a total of 905 patients, most of whom were treated previously. The partial response rate was 2% for CHEMICALNOTIN and 0% for placebo. Stable disease was observed in 78% and 55% of patients on CHEMICALNOTIN and placebo, respectively. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly prolonged median progression-free survival (24 weeks) compared with placebo (12 weeks) in all subsets of patients evaluated. Approval of CHEMICALNOTIN by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this indication is pending. A first-line phase III study in RCC as well as phase III studies in hepatocellular carcinoma and metastatic melanoma have been initiated.
16495926	A selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) inhibits angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours. The present study determined the influence of a GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN on angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours. In the experimental lung metastasis xenograft models, treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the development of the lung tumour nodule formation compared to control. In vivo angiogenesis assay utilising gelfoam sponges, CHEMICALIN reduced angiogenesis in sponges containing GENEIN, GENEIN and basic GENEIN to various extent. To determine the basis of these observations, human breast and non-small-cell lung cancer cells were subjected to migration and invasion assays in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. Our data showed that CHEMICALNOTIN decrease migration and invasiveness of tumour cells in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited angiogenesis by directly inhibiting human umbilical vein endothelial cell growth and indirectly inhibiting tumour cell-mediated migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells through Matrigel matrix. Analysis of tumour-conditioned medium indicated that CHEMICALIN decreased the secretion of angiogenic factors and GENEIN and increased the tissue inhibitor of GENEIN. The ability of CHEMICALIN to inhibit angiogenesis and metastasis was dependent on activation of its heterodimerisation partner GENEIN. Collectively, our results suggest a role of CHEMICALNOTIN in treatment of angiogenesis and metastasis in solid tumours.
16513877	DRD2 promoter region variation as a predictor of sustained response to antipsychotic medication in first-episode schizophrenia patients. OBJECTIVE: All antipsychotics act on the dopamine D(2) receptor. The present study extends prior pharmacogenetic investigations of the D(2) receptor gene (DRD2) by examining, in first-episode schizophrenia patients, promoter region variation as a predictor of response time to two first-line atypical antipsychotics. METHOD: Patients experiencing their first episode of schizophrenia (N=61) were genotyped for two DRD2 promoter region polymorphisms (A-241G and -141C Ins/Del) and were randomly assigned to receive 16 weeks of treatment with either risperidone or olanzapine. Time until sustained response (two consecutive ratings without significant positive symptoms) for rare allele carriers versus wild types was examined by using Kaplan-Meier curves. RESULTS: Relative to wild type homozygotes, G carriers (A-241G) exhibited a significantly faster time until response, whereas -141C Del carriers took a significantly longer time to respond. Diplotype analysis revealed similar results. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that variation in the D(2) receptor gene can, in part, explain variation in the timing of clinical response to antipsychotics in patients with first-episode schizophrenia.
16532916	Intrauterine pressure, ischemia markers, and experienced pain during administration of a GENENOTIN antagonist in spontaneous and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced dysmenorrhea. BACKGROUND: A model to study the effect of GENENOTIN antagonist in dysmenorrhea. METHODS: A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial was performed. Eight patients with primary dysmenorrhea and eight tuballigated, healthy subjects participated on days 1-2 of two consecutive menstruations. At each menstruation a bolus injection of 10 pmol/kg of GENENOTIN was administered before and during infusion of either 300 microg/min of CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo. Intrauterine pressure was measured as area under the curve throughout the experiments. Ischemia markers in plasma and pain recorded by a visual analog scale were measured before and after each CHEMICALNOTIN injection as well as before and after the start of either CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo infusion. RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN injections elevated area under the curve in both healthy volunteers and dysmenorrhea subjects. The CHEMICALNOTIN-induced rise in area under the curve was lower during CHEMICALNOTIN administration than during infusion of placebo in both groups. None of the ischemia markers differed between or within groups at CHEMICALNOTIN injections or CHEMICALNOTIN/placebo infusions. In subjects with dysmenorrhea the increase in pain following the administration of GENEIN was significantly lower during CHEMICALIN than during placebo infusion. Healthy volunteers experienced only slight discomfort after the GENENOTIN injections. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALIN reduces GENEIN-induced intrauterine pressure in both healthy volunteers and dysmenorrheics, and reported pain in subjects with dysmenorrhea. The ischemia markers are not a useful biomarker index in women with dysmenorrhea. The dysmenorrhea pain evoked by CHEMICALIN correlated poorly with area under the curve, which may suggest that the effect is mediated by more than one GENEIN. We conclude that this model with recordings in healthy women is useful in the evaluation of drug candidates for primary dysmenorrhea.
16538493	GENENOTIN expression in resectable and unresectable pancreatic cancer: role as predictive or prognostic marker? BACKGROUND AND AIMS: GENEIN (GENEIN) is an important enzyme for DNA synthesis and the target for CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Its expression may determine the outcome of patients with gastrointestinal cancers. We examined the prognostic and predictive value of GENENOTIN-protein expression in patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. METHODS: GENENOTIN expression from 131 patients with ductal adenocarcinoma of the pancreas was analyzed by immunohistochemistry in paraffin-embedded primary tumour specimens or biopsies. RESULTS: The median disease-specific survival among all patients (n=131) was 13 months. The invasion depth, the presence of metastases, grading and Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [International Union Against Cancer] (UICC) stage were associated with survival. Among resected patients (n=98), a difference in median survival was seen in the group receiving postoperative adjuvant treatment (21.1 months) compared with the group treated by surgery alone (12.4 months) (p=0.025). Low- and high-GENENOTIN immunoreactivity was present in 74 (56%) and 56 (43%) of the cancers, respectively. One sample was not evaluable. No difference in median survival was observed among low- and high-GENENOTIN-expressing tumours. Among patients undergoing resection and receiving postoperative intra-arterial chemotherapy (n=23), a marked trend to a longer median survival was seen for the group with low-GENENOTIN-expressing tumours compared with the corresponding high-GENENOTIN group (25.0 vs 16.0 months) (p=0.3834). There was no difference in survival among all palliative treated patients with low- and high-GENENOTIN-expressing tumours. CONCLUSION: Especially patients undergoing tumour resection with low-GENENOTIN values seemed to have taken advantage from an intensified postoperative chemotherapeutic protocol. However due to the heterogeneous group of patients in the present report, larger trials of more homogenous patient populations will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
16580895	Enzymatic and biochemical properties of a novel GENENOTIN isoform. A cDNA clone similar to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is deposited in the GenBank/EMBL databases, but its structural and functional bases remain unknown. Despite the occurrence of mRNA, the expected protein level was found to be low in cultured cells. To learn about physicochemical properties of the protein, we expressed the cDNA in Escherichia coli, and compared the expressed protein with that of a hepatic GENENOTIN. The purified protein showed GENENOTIN activity, demonstrating to be an isoform of GENENOTIN. However, their Km and Vmax constants were different in a range of two-order. Removal of Pro128 from the hepatic GENEIN consisting of 328 residues, which is missing in the corresponding position of the isoform consisting of 329 residues, significantly changed the Michaelis constants and Kd value for CHEMICALIN, whereas addition of a CHEMICALIN residue to the isoform was without effect. These findings suggest the difference in the structures of the active sites of the two enzymes. Another striking feature was that the expressed level of the isoform in E. coli was 7-fold lower than that of the hepatic GENENOTIN. Substitution of GENENOTIN in the isoform dramatically increased the protein level. The high yield of the mutated isoform was also confirmed by the in vitro transcription and translation experiment. The poor expression of the isoform could be explained by the more stable secondary structure of the mRNA than that of the hepatic GENENOTIN mRNA. The present findings may provide a clue as to why the protein level in cultured cells is low.
16599255	Multiple enzyme inhibitions by GENENOTIN antagonists as potential procognitive agents. Novel highly affine GENENOTIN ligands with additional inhibitory effects on the main CHEMICALIN metabolizing enzyme in the brain, GENEIN, chemically show structural elements of the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN antagonism, inhibition of metabolisation of neuronal CHEMICALNOTIN as well as inhibition of hydrolysis of CHEMICALNOTIN are each one believed to improve reduced cognitive functions, which is useful for symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Some of the new compounds proved in a slightly modified colorimetric Ellmann's assay to be potent inhibitors of GENEIN and of GENEIN which is another catalytic enzyme hydrolysing CHEMICALIN. Some compounds with (sub)nanomolar activities on the CHEMICALNOTIN-related targets are also active in the nanomolar concentration range on both GENENOTIN targets being 5- to 40-times more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN. Preliminary structure-activity relationships could already be drawn from the small number of compounds. The compounds acting as hybrid drugs simultaneously on four different targets to enhance cognitive functions via different pathways are promising lead structures for a new approach in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
16609060	Chemotherapy and targeted therapy combinations in advanced melanoma. For three decades, clinical trials with chemotherapy in melanoma have failed to show superiority of any one regimen over another. CHEMICALNOTIN remains the only "standard" agent. With response rates of <10% and median progression-free survival of 2 months or less in contemporary trials, there is a need to improve systemic therapy. Combination chemotherapy is associated with higher response rates than single-agent therapy but this has not translated into improved survival. An increasing number of potential therapeutic targets have been identified. For some, pharmacologic inhibitors are available, including CHEMICALIN for GENEIN, GENENOTIN inhibitors for GENENOTIN, CHEMICALIN for GENEIN/GENEIN, CHEMICALIN analogues for GENEIN, and agents that inhibit either GENENOTIN or its receptors. Several multitargeted GENENOTIN inhibitors have potency against the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. Small-molecule inhibitors of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are in preclinical development. Another class of agents indirectly affect aberrant signaling, including inhibitors of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Several targeted agents seem to enhance the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in preclinical models. The mechanism by which signaling inhibition might synergize with chemotherapy requires more study so that rational combinations move forward. Very few targeted agents have been studied rigorously in this fashion.
16618126	Lipid specific activation of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The asymmetric transbilayer distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in the mammalian plasma membrane and secretory vesicles is maintained, in part, by an CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent transporter. This aminophospholipid "GENEIN" selectively transports CHEMICALIN to the cytosolic leaflet of the bilayer and is sensitive to CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and modification by CHEMICALIN reagents. Although the GENENOTIN has not been positively identified, a subfamily of GENENOTIN has been proposed to function as transporters of amphipaths, including PS and other phospholipids. A candidate GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), originally isolated from bovine secretory vesicles, is a member of this subfamily based on sequence homology to the founding member of the subfamily, the GENENOTIN, which has been linked to ribosomal assembly, the formation of Golgi-coated vesicles, and the maintenance of PS asymmetry. To determine if GENENOTIN has biochemical characteristics consistent with a GENENOTIN, a murine homologue of this enzyme was expressed in insect cells and purified. The purified GENEIN is inactive in detergent micelles or in micelles containing CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN, is minimally activated by CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and is maximally activated by CHEMICALIN. The selectivity for CHEMICALNOTIN is dependent upon multiple elements of the lipid structure. Similar to the GENEIN, GENEIN is activated only by the naturally occurring CHEMICALIN isomer of PS and not the CHEMICALIN stereoisomer. Both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities are insensitive to the stereochemistry of the serine headgroup. Most modifications of the CHEMICALNOTIN headgroup structure decrease recognition by the plasma membrane GENENOTIN. Activation of GENEIN is also reduced by these modifications; CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, which are not transported by the plasma membrane flippase, do not activate GENEIN. Weakly translocated lipids (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) are also weak GENEIN activators. However, CHEMICALIN, which is transported by the plasma membrane GENEIN at a rate equivalent to CHEMICALNOTIN, is incapable of activating GENEIN activity. These results indicate that the GENEIN activity of the secretory granule GENEIN is activated by phospholipids binding to a specific site whose properties (CHEMICALIN selectivity, dependence upon CHEMICALNOTIN but not CHEMICALNOTIN, stereochemistry, and vanadate sensitivity) are similar to, but distinct from, the properties of the substrate binding site of the plasma membrane GENENOTIN.
16622728	Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis as a complication of treatment with infliximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha neutralizing antibody. We report that a-63-year-old woman developed Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) as a complication from treatment with infliximab for rheumatoid arthritis. Although there was neither symptoms of dyspnea nor typical observations on a chest X-ray examination, low levels of oxygen saturation and findings of high-resolution chest computed tomographic scanning suggested a possibility of interstitial pneumonia. A polymerase chain reaction-based detection of Pneumocystis jiroveci in induced sputum allowed an early diagnosis of PCP and subsequent effective treatment.
16647263	High-mannose-type glycan modifications of dihydrofolate reductase using glycan-methotrexate conjugates. Various high-mannose-type glycan modifications of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) were achieved by ligand-based approach using glycan-methotrexate (MTX) conjugates as tight binding glycan bearing ligands for DHFR. The resulting glycan-MTX conjugates and the corresponding artificial glycoproteins could be useful as oligosaccharide- and glycoprotein-probes to perform quantitative analysis of glycan recognizing protein such as lectins, glycosyltransferases or glycosidases. Moreover, artificial glycoproteins having two different high-mannose-type glycans were developed for the first time by a combination of two different types of glycan modification strategies.
16719808	GENENOTIN are not alone: dynamic regulation of GENENOTIN structure and function by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN leads to disease-specific nuances of CHEMICALNOTIN-signalling. GENENOTIN of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN-) subtype are tetrameric allosteric and GENENOTIN. They are modulated by a variety of endogenous ligands and ions and play a pivotal role in memory-related signal transduction due to a voltage-dependent block by CHEMICALNOTIN, which makes them Hebbian coincidence detectors. On the structural level GENENOTIN have an enormous flexibility due to seven genes (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), alternative splicing, RNA-editing and extensive posttranslational modifications, like phosphorylation and glycosylation. GENENOTIN are thought to be responsible for excitotoxicity and subsequent downstream events like neuroinflammation and apoptosis and thus have been implicated in many important human pathologies, ranging from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer's and Parkinson' disease, depression, epilepsy, trauma and stroke to schizophrenia. This fundamental significance of GENEIN-related excitotoxicity is discussed in the context of the developing clinical success of CHEMICALIN, but moreover set into relation to various proteomic and genetic markers of said diseases. The very complex localisational and functional regulation of GENENOTIN appears to be dependent on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-rich membrane domains (lipid rafts), CHEMICALNOTIN-related mitochondrial feedback-loops and subsynaptic structural elements like GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The flexibility and multitude of interaction partners and possibilities of these highly dynamic molecular systems are discussed in terms of drug development strategies, in particular comparing high affinity and sub-type specific ligands to currently successful or promising therapies.
16729906	CHEMICALNOTIN: recent update on activity as a single agent and in combination with GENENOTIN in patients with advanced-stage renal cell carcinoma. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma does not respond favorably to conventional treatment strategies and is not very responsive to cytokine therapy. Therefore, novel targeted treatment approaches have been explored for patients with renal cancer who have chemotherapy-refractory disease. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a small-molecule inhibitor that has been shown to target members of multiple classes of GENEIN that are known to be involved in tumor cell proliferation and tumor angiogenesis. These GENENOTIN include GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Based on the significant improvement in progression-free survival, CHEMICALNOTIN received Food and Drug Administration approval in December 2005 for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma. In combination studies, CHEMICALNOTIN with other antitumor agents has demonstrated significant clinical activity in patients with renal cell carcinoma. As discussed in this mini-review, the clinical potency of CHEMICALNOTIN as a single agent or in combination with other antitumor agents is being evaluated in several ongoing clinical trials in patients with renal carcinoma.
16781459	CHEMICALIN inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN production and GENEIN via GENEIN expression in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a regulatory gaseous molecule that is endogenously synthesized by GENEIN (GENEIN) and/or GENEIN (GENEIN) from CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) metabolism, is a putative vasodilator, and its role in CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) production is unexplored. Here, we show that at noncytotoxic concentrations, CHEMICALIN was able to inhibit CHEMICALIN production and GENEIN (GENEIN) expression via GENEIN (GENEIN) expression in RAW264.7 macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Both CHEMICALIN solution prepared by bubbling pure CHEMICALNOTIN gas and CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN donor, dose dependently induced GENEIN expression through the activation of the GENEIN (GENEIN). Pretreatment with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN significantly inhibited LPS-induced GENEIN expression and CHEMICALIN production. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN production in LPS-stimulated macrophages that are expressing GENEIN mRNA was significantly reduced by the addition of CHEMICALIN, a substrate for CHEMICALNOTIN, but enhanced by the selective GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN but not by the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. While either blockage of GENENOTIN activity by the GENENOTIN inhibitor, tin protoporphyrin IX, or down-regulation of GENENOTIN expression by GENENOTIN small interfering RNA (siRNA) reversed the inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN expression and CHEMICALIN production, GENENOTIN overexpression produced the same inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN. In addition, LPS-induced nuclear factor GENEIN activation was diminished in RAW264.7 macrophages preincubated with CHEMICALIN. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activation was reversed by the transient transfection with GENENOTIN siRNA, but was mimicked by either GENEIN gene transfection or treatment with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an end product of GENEIN. CHEMICALIN treatment also inhibited LPS-induced CHEMICALIN production and GENEIN expression via its inactivation of GENEIN. Collectively, our results suggest that CHEMICALIN can inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN production and GENEIN activation in LPS-stimulated macrophages through a mechanism that involves the action of GENEIN/CHEMICALIN.
16809898	Effect of chronic renal failure on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) participates in numerous biological functions including CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis. Sources of CHEMICALIN include dietary proteins and endogenous synthesis by GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN is converted to CHEMICALIN by GENEIN in the liver and GENEIN in the kidney. Normally, the liver fully consumes CHEMICALNOTIN for CHEMICALNOTIN generation and does not contribute to its circulating pool. Instead, much of the circulating CHEMICALNOTIN is produced by the kidney. If true, plasma CHEMICALNOTIN should be severely reduced in chronic renal failure (CRF); however, plasma CHEMICALNOTIN is frequently unchanged in CRF. We hypothesized that preservation of plasma CHEMICALIN in CRF may be, partly, due to downregulation/inhibition of GENEIN. METHODS: GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN protein abundance and activity were measured in the liver and kidneys of rats 6 weeks after 5/6 nephrectomy or sham operation. In addition, GENENOTIN activity was measured in the presence of different CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations to simulate azotemia in vitro. RESULTS: GENENOTIN protein abundance as well as GENENOTIN activity in the liver, measured in the physiological buffer, were similar among the CRF and control groups. However, in vitro experiments simulating a uremic milieu revealed a marked concentration-dependent inhibition of GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN in the tissue lysates. CRF had no significant effect on GENENOTIN abundance in the kidney, liver, spleen or intestine. CONCLUSIONS: Although CRF does not change the abundance or intrinsic properties of GENEIN, the inherent rise in CHEMICALIN concentration inhibits its enzymatic activity. The latter, in turn, attenuates CHEMICALNOTIN catabolism and urea production and, thereby, mitigates the fall in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN.
16814387	Epratuzumab, a CD22-targeting recombinant humanized antibody with a different mode of action from rituximab. Epratuzumab is a humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal antibody currently in clinical trials for treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and certain autoimmune diseases. Here we report the results of investigations of epratuzumab's mode of action in comparison to and in combination with the anti-CD20 mAb, rituximab. In vitro cell growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis, and the ability of the mAbs to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) were evaluated. We also investigated the potential activity of epratuzumab in the regulation of B-cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation. Epratuzumab and rituximab displayed very distinct modes of action; epratuzumab acts as an immunomodulatory agent, while rituximab is an acutely cytotoxic therapeutic antibody. Epratuzumab has distinct effects on cell growth from rituximab. For example, rituximab+anti-human IgG Fcgamma yielded marked inhibition of proliferation in human NHL cell lines, while epratuzumab had little or no effect in this assay. However, when cells were immobilized and stimulated with anti-IgM, epratuzumab, but not rituximab, caused a significant antiproliferative effect. Unlike rituximab, no CDC could be detected, and ADCC was modest but significant with epratuzumab. Importantly, combining rituximab and epratuzumab did not decrease rituximab's ability to induce apoptosis, CDC, and ADCC. In fact, the combination is more effective than rituximab alone in inhibiting proliferation of Daudi Burkitt lymphoma cells in the presence of second antibody, and at least equally effective to rituximab in the absence of crosslinking. These observations suggest that it may be possible to enhance clinical efficacy by combination therapy comprised of anti-CD20 and anti-CD22 mAbs.
16843091	CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists as aquaretic agents for the treatment of hyponatremia. Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder encountered in hospitalized patients. It is a state of relative water excess due to stimulated GENENOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and fluid intake greater than obligatory losses. This kind of hyponatremia occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate GENENOTIN secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. Fluid restriction is the presently recommended treatment for hyponatremia. However, fluid restriction may be very difficult for patients to achieve, is slow to work, and does not allow a graded therapeutic approach. More efficient and specific treatments of hyponatremia are needed. In this respect, pharmacologic research has yielded a number of compounds exhibiting antagonistic qualities at the GENENOTIN. Among these agents, peptidic derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN turned out to have intrinsic antidiuretic properties in vivo when given over days or weeks. The development of such agents for use in patients has not been pursued. However, several promising nonpeptide, GENEIN antagonists have been described; these agents are CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials performed with these agents found that they corrected hyponatremia efficiently and safely. Most of the studies were conducted over a 4- to 28-day period. Long-term studies will be needed in the future to address such issues as the eventual benefit to patients and the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists on morbidity and mortality of patients with hyponatremia.
1686208	Sedation and GENEIN antagonism: studies in man with the enantiomers of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. 1. The effects of 10 mg CHEMICALNOTIN and 5 mg CHEMICALNOTIN on daytime sleep latencies, digit symbol substitution and subjective assessments of mood and well-being were studied in 6 healthy young adult humans. Each subject also took 5 mg CHEMICALNOTIN as an active control and two placebos. 2. Daytime sleep latencies were reduced with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and subjects also reported that they felt more sleepy after CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Performance on digit symbol substitution was impaired with CHEMICALNOTIN. 3. Changes in measures with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were not different from changes with placebo. 4. In the present study, changes in measures of drowsiness and performance were limited to the enantiomers with high affinity for the GENENOTIN. These findings strongly suggest that sedation can arise from GENENOTIN antagonism alone, and provide further support for the belief that the histaminergic system is concerned with the regulation of alertness in man.
16866189	Anti-clastogenic effect of beta-glucan extracted from barley towards chemically induced DNA damage in rodent cells. beta-Glucan (BG) was tested in vitro to determine its potential clastogenic and/or anti-clastogenic activity, and attempts were made to elucidate its possible mechanism of action by using combinations with an inhibitor of GENENOTIN. The study was carried out on cells deficient (CHO-k1) and cells proficient (HTC) in phases I and II enzymes, and the DNA damage was assessed by the chromosomal aberration assay. BG did not show a clastogenic effect, but was anti-clastogenic in both cell lines used, and at all concentrations tested (2.5, 5 and 10 microg/mL) in combination with damage inducing agents (CHEMICALNOTIN in cell line CHO-k1, and CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN in cell line HTC). BG also showed a protective effect in the presence of a GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), demonstrating that BG does not act through an anti-mutagenic mechanism of action involving GENENOTIN.
16867246	Association of GENENOTIN polymorphisms and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients. AIM: Extrapyramidal syndrome (EPS) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the GENENOTIN. Recently, many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the GENENOTIN gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression. In this study, we evaluate the role GENENOTIN plays in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced EPS in schizophrenic patients. METHODS: We identified seven SNP(single CHEMICALIN polymorphism) (-141Cins>del, TaqIB, TaqID, GENEIN, rs6275, rs6277 and TaqIA) in the GENEIN gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients (59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson-Angus Scale) treated with CHEMICALNOTIN after 8 weeks. The alleles of all loci were determined by PCR (polymerase chain reaction). RESULTS: Polymorphisms TaqID, GENENOTIN and rs6277 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present study. No statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -141Cins>del, TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA or in the estimated haplotypes (constituted by TaqIB, rs6275 and TaqIA) in linkage disequilibrium between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the GENEIN gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by CHEMICALIN, at least in Chinese patients with schizophrenia. Our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between GENENOTIN and EPS in Caucasians.
16879709	Activity-dependent cleavage of brain GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN. Previously, we reported that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) could be cleaved in vitro to release a stable truncated form which lacks CHEMICALNOTIN 1-69 from the CHEMICALIN-terminus, GENEIN. However, whether such a truncated form is also present under certain physiological conditions remains elusive. In the present study, we showed that, upon sustained neuronal stimulation, GENENOTIN could be cleaved into a truncated form in a rat synaptosomal preparation. This truncated form had similar electrophoretic mobility to purified recombinant GENENOTIN). Furthermore, we demonstrated that this conversion was CHEMICALNOTIN dependent. CHEMICALNOTIN-chelating reagents such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN prevented the cleavage of GENEIN. In addition, our data suggested that GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN, is activated upon neuronal stimulation and could be responsible for the conversion of full-length GENENOTIN to truncated GENENOTIN in the brain. Moreover, GENENOTIN inhibitors such as calpain inhibitor I or GENENOTIN could block the cleavage. Results of our in vitro cleavage assay using purified GENENOTIN and immunopurified GENENOTIN also supported the idea that GENENOTIN could be directly cleaved by GENENOTIN.
16901402	Therapeutic targets in melanoma: GENENOTIN pathway. Recent progress in our understanding of the genetic alterations that occur in the pathogenesis of melanoma provides exciting opportunities for therapy. The most important signaling pathways in melanoma lie downstream of GENENOTIN: the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN pathway. A great deal of attention has been focused on the high mutation rate in the GENENOTIN oncogene, which approaches 60%, because GENENOTIN itself is an appealing drug substrate and because of the central contribution of GENENOTIN function to melanoma development that the mutation rate signifies. Agents that specifically target GENEIN, such as CHEMICALIN, as well as new molecules that function both upstream and downstream of GENENOTIN, are being actively investigated.
16901636	Reduction of cerebral infarct size by the GENEIN-receptor blocker CHEMICALIN, the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN and their combination. An experimental study in rats. Our purpose was to test the impact of single and/or combined treatment with the GENEIN-receptor blocker CHEMICALIN and the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN on infarct size and neuroscore in transient cerebral ischemia in rats. CHEMICALNOTIN was used to test whether any potential effect was due to activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Therefore, the middle cerebral artery was occluded for 1 h (MCAO) followed by 7 days reperfusion. Rats received CHEMICALNOTIN 2h before and daily after MCAO (pretreatment) or daily after MCAO (posttreatment); CHEMICALNOTIN was given daily for 7 days before MCAO without or with CHEMICALNOTIN pre- and posttreatment. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were combined with CHEMICALNOTIN. Infarct size and neuroscore at day 7 were compared to those of controls. As result, compared to controls (109+/-12 mm(3)) infarct size with CHEMICALNOTIN (pretreatment: 21+/-5 mm(3); posttreatment: 68+/-29 mm(3); P<0.05) or CHEMICALNOTIN (69+/-14 mm(3); P<0.05) was smaller. Combined treatment also reduced infarct size (pretreatment: 37+/-15 mm(3); posttreatment 57+/-20mm(3); P<0.05); but there was no benefit of combined treatment over CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment alone. Compared to controls (2.08+/-0.28) only CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment and combined treatment improved the neuroscore (0.97+/-0.05, 1.10+/-0.33; P<0.05). CHEMICALNOTIN abolished the reduction in infarct size and improvement in neuroscore. In conclusion, both, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN treatment alone reduced infarct size in transient cerebral ischemia, and the best result was achieved with CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment. Combined treatment was superior to CHEMICALNOTIN alone, but not to CHEMICALNOTIN. The therapeutic benefit of both agents was at least in parts mediated by GENENOTIN-activation.
16902423	ABCA12 is the major harlequin ichthyosis gene. Harlequin ichthyosis (HI) is the most severe form of autosomal-recessive, congenital ichthyosis. Affected infants have markedly impaired barrier function and are more susceptible to infection. Abnormalities in the localization of epidermal lipids as well as abnormal lamellar granule formation are features of HI skin. Previously, we and others have shown that mutations in the ABCA12 gene encoding an adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette (ABC) transporter underlie the skin disease HI. In this study, we have sequenced the ABCA12 gene in an additional 14 patients and show that all contain mutations, with the majority being either nonsense substitution or frameshift mutations. Eleven HI patients had bi-allelic ABCA12 mutations, whereas in the remaining three HI patients in this study, ABCA12 mutations were detected on only one allele by sequencing. In addition, the one patient from the previous study where no sequence mutations were detected was screened for heterozygous deletions. A combination of oligonucleotide arrays, multiplex PCR analysis and single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping revealed a heterozygous intragenic deletion in exon 8. These mutation data establish ABCA12 as the major HI gene.
16905533	Phosphorylation and up-regulation of GENENOTIN via its interaction with GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) acts as an allosteric activator of GENEIN (GENEIN) and is converted to CHEMICALIN by GENEIN (GENEIN). Therefore, GENENOTIN is thought to be a negative regulator of GENENOTIN activation. Here we show molecular mechanisms of functional coupling of the two GENENOTIN. GENEIN directly associated with GENEIN through its accessory domain (AD), depending on CHEMICALIN as well as CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN in vitro. Mass spectrometric analysis and mutation studies revealed that GENEIN CHEMICALIN-776 and CHEMICALIN-779 in the AD of GENEIN. The phosphorylation by GENENOTIN resulted in activation of GENENOTIN because a GENEIN mutant in which CHEMICALIN-776 and CHEMICALIN-779 were substituted with CHEMICALIN to mimic phosphorylation exhibited significantly higher activity compared with wild type GENENOTIN and an unphosphorylatable GENENOTIN mutant. Importantly, the interaction of the two GENENOTIN and the phosphorylation of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN could be confirmed in vivo, and overexpression of the AD of GENENOTIN inhibited re-translocation of GENENOTIN. These results demonstrate that localization and activation of the functionally correlated GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, are spatio-temporally orchestrated by their direct association and phosphorylation, contributing to subtype-specific regulation of GENENOTIN and DAG signaling.
1692236	Differences in conformational stability between native and GENENOTIN as evidenced by a monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibody 25B1 generated against CHEMICALIN inhibited fetal GENEIN has been extensively characterized with respect to its GENENOTIN properties. This antibody demonstrated considerably different properties from previously reported inhibitory antibodies raised against GENENOTIN in terms of the degree of inhibition (greater than 98%), the high degree of specificity, and the stability of the antigen-antibody complex. Monoclonal antibody 25B1 appears to be directed against a conformational epitope located in close proximity to the catalytic center of the enzyme and was found to be most suitable for studying the stabilization of the active site of GENEIN against denaturation by heat or CHEMICALIN following phosphorylation by organophosphorus GENENOTIN compounds. This approach allowed the determination of stability rank order of various GENENOTIN. Among all the CHEMICALIN tested, the combination of a methyl group and a negatively charged CHEMICALIN attached to the CHEMICALIN atom, CHEMICALIN-GENEIN, conferred the greatest protection to the active site of aged or nonaged CHEMICALIN conjugates of GENEIN.
16950805	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN polymorphism on spontaneous and radiation-induced micronuclei in human lymphocytes. CHEMICALNOTIN plays a key role in the maintenance of genomic stability, providing methyl groups for the conversion of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN and for DNA methylation. Besides dietary habits, CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism is influenced by genetic polymorphism. The GENEIN polymorphism of the GENEIN (GENEIN) gene is associated with a reduction of catalytic activity and is suggested to modify cancer risk differently depending on CHEMICALIN status. In this work the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency on genome stability and radiosensitivity has been investigated in cultured lymphocytes of 12 subjects with different GENENOTIN genotype (four for each genotype). Cells were grown for 9 days with 12, 24 and 120 nM CHEMICALNOTIN and analyzed in a comprehensive micronucleus test coupled with centromere characterization by CREST immunostaining. In other experiments, cells were grown with various CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations, irradiated with 0.5 Gy of gamma rays and analyzed in the micronucleus test. The results obtained indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency induces to a comparable extent chromosome loss and breakage, irrespective of the GENENOTIN genotype. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was highly significant (P < 0.001) and explained >50% of variance of both types of micronuclei. Also nucleoplasmic bridges and buds were significantly increased under low CHEMICALNOTIN supply; the increase in bridges was mainly observed in TT cells, highlighting a significant effect of the GENENOTIN genotype (P = 0.006) on this biomarker. CHEMICALNOTIN concentration significantly affected radiation-induced micronuclei (P < 0.001): the increased incidence of radiation-induced micronuclei with low CHEMICALNOTIN was mainly accounted for by carriers of the variant GENENOTIN allele (both homozygotes and heterozygotes), but the overall effect of genotype did not attain statistical significance. Treatment with ionizing radiations also increased the frequency of nucleoplasmic bridges. The effect of CHEMICALIN level on this end-point was modulated by the GENEIN genotype (P for interaction = 0.02), with TT cells grown at low CHEMICALNOTIN concentration apparently resistant to the induction of radiation-induced bridges. Finally, the effect of in vitro CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation on global DNA methylation was evaluated in lymphocytes of six homozygous subjects (three CC and three TT). The results obtained suggest that, under the conditions of this work, CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation is associated with global DNA hypermethylation.
16964330	Antifungal agents: mode of action in yeast cells. Different kinds of mycoses, especially invasive, have become an important public health problem as their incidence has increased dramatically in the last decades in relation to AIDS, hematological malignancies, transplant recipients and other immunosuppressed individuals. Management of fungal infections is markedly limited by problems of drug safety, resistance and effectiveness profile. Current therapy for invasive mycoses uses a relatively reduced number of antifungal drugs, such as CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Other new antifungal agents from old and new chemical families, like CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, have been introduced into the armamentarium for fungal infections management. This review is focused on the mode of action of those antifungal drugs used against pathogenic yeasts. The interaction of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN and other membrane CHEMICALNOTIN results in the production of aqueous pores of drug and the CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthetic pathway is the target of the CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN antifungal agents. The main molecular target of CHEMICALIN antifungals is the GENEIN protein GENEIN/GENEIN. Echinocandins, a new class of antifungal drugs, are fungal secondary metabolites that act against beta-1-3-D-glucan synthesis. The CHEMICALIN, of which CHEMICALIN is the sole representative in human therapy, affect two targets in the ergosterol pathway: GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). The CHEMICALIN group are protein synthesis inhibitors that work by blocking the function of GENEIN. Other protein inhibitors are CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. In order to overcome the problems derived from the exploitation of CHEMICALNOTIN drugs, macrolides and CHEMICALNOTIN, novel targets were explored. Proposed antifungal drugs have been developed against potential targets like the CHEMICALNOTIN-myristylation of fungal proteins, with inhibitors like CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN analogues or myristoylpeptide derivatives, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Polymerization of cell wall carbohydrates from CHEMICALNOTIN is another potential target.
16965760	CHEMICALIN as a surrogate of CHEMICALIN to monitor GENEIN activation. GENEIN (GENEIN)-coupled GENEIN (GENEIN) activities traditionally are assessed by measuring CHEMICALIN triggered by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a GENEIN hydrolysis product, or by measuring the production of CHEMICALIN using cumbersome radioactive assays. A specific detection of CHEMICALNOTIN production was also established using CHEMICALNOTIN binding proteins. The short lifetime of CHEMICALIN makes this detection very challenging in measuring GENEIN responses. Indeed, this CHEMICALNOTIN rapidly enters the metabolic CHEMICALNOTIN cascade. It has been known for decades that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) leads to CHEMICALIN accumulation on GENEIN activation by inhibiting GENEIN, the final enzyme of the CHEMICALIN metabolic cascade. We show here that CHEMICALIN can be used as a surrogate of CHEMICALIN to monitor GENEIN activation. We developed a novel homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay that correlates perfectly with existing methods and is easily amenable to high-throughput screening. The IP-One assay was validated on various GENENOTIN models. It has the advantage over the traditional CHEMICALIN assay of allowing the measurement of inverse agonist activity as well as the analysis of GENEIN activity in any nontransfected primary cultures. Finally, the high assay specificity for CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN(1)) opens new possibilities in developing selective assays to study the functional roles of the various isoforms of CHEMICALNOTIN.
16970975	Non-enzymatic interactions of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN: a study of advanced non-enzymatic glycation like compounds. CHEMICALNOTIN is a 2 CHEMICALNOTIN that is formed in hepatic tissue from CHEMICALNOTIN. Once formed, the molecule can be converted to CHEMICALIN by GENEIN (GENEIN). In defects of GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN is transformed to CHEMICALNOTIN, resulting in high levels of CHEMICALNOTIN in the body. The objective of this study was 2-fold. First, it was to determine, if akin to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN was susceptible to non-enzymatic attack by CHEMICALNOTIN containing molecules such as CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Second, if by virtue of its molecular structure and size, CHEMICALNOTIN was as reactive a reagent in non-enzymatic reactions as CHEMICALNOTIN; i.e., a CHEMICALNOTIN that we previously demonstrated to be a more effective glycating agent than CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Using capillary electrophoresis (CE), high performance liquid chromatography and UV and fluorescence spectroscopy, CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be a highly reactive precursor of advanced glycation like end products (AGLEs) and a more effective promoter of non-enzymatic end products than CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN.
16980198	CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism in hypertension. CHEMICALNOTIN are critically involved in blood pressure regulation. Lack of adrenal CHEMICALNOTIN in Addison's disease causes life-threatening hypotension, whereas glucocorticoid excess in Cushing's syndrome invariably results in high blood pressure. At a pre-receptor level, glucocorticoid action is modulated by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). GENEIN activates CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN to facilitate GENEIN (GENEIN)-mediated action. By contrast, GENEIN plays a pivotal role in CHEMICALIN target tissues where it catalyses the opposite reaction (i.e. inactivation of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN) to prevent activation of the GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN. Mutations in the GENENOTIN gene cause a rare form of inherited hypertension, the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME), in which CHEMICALIN activates the GENEIN resulting in severe hypertension and hypokalemia. Ingestion of competitive inhibitors of GENEIN such as liquorice and CHEMICALIN result in a similar but milder clinical phenotype. Epidemiological data suggests that polymorphic variability in the GENENOTIN gene determines salt sensitivity in the general population, which is a key predisposing factor to adult onset hypertension in some patients. Extrarenal sites of glucocorticoid action and metabolism that might impact on blood pressure include the vasculature and the central nervous system. Intriguingly, increased exposure to glucocorticoids during fetal life promotes high blood pressure in adulthood suggesting an early programming effect. Thus, metabolism and action in many peripheral tissues might contribute to the pathophysiology of human hypertension.
16982809	GENENOTIN controls GENENOTIN expression by turning on CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis in developing human dendritic cells. Dendritic cells (DCs) expressing GENENOTIN, a molecule responsible for lipid antigen presentation, are capable of enhancing natural killer T (iNKT) cell proliferation. The signals controlling GENENOTIN expression and lipid antigen presentation are poorly defined. We have shown previously that stimulation of the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, indirectly regulates GENENOTIN expression. Here we demonstrate that GENENOTIN, turns on CHEMICALIN synthesis by inducing the expression of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN metabolizing enzymes such as GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN). GENENOTIN-regulated expression of these enzymes leads to an increase in the intracellular generation of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) from CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN regulates gene expression via the activation of the GENEIN in human DCs, and GENEIN acutely regulates GENEIN expression. The CHEMICALIN-induced elevated expression of GENEIN is coupled to enhanced iNKT cell activation. Furthermore, in vivo relevant lipids such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein can also elicit CHEMICALIN signaling leading to GENEIN up-regulation. These data show that regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism and signaling is part of the GENENOTIN-controlled transcriptional events in DCs. The uncovered mechanisms allow the DCs to respond to altered lipid homeostasis by changing GENENOTIN gene expression.
17015817	CHEMICALNOTIN: a novel hypnotic lacking abuse liability and sedative adverse effects. CONTEXT: CHEMICALIN is a novel GENEIN and GENEIN selective agonist recently approved for insomnia treatment. Most approved insomnia medications have potential for abuse and cause motor and cognitive impairment. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential for abuse, subjective effects, and motor and cognitive-impairing effects of CHEMICALNOTIN compared with CHEMICALNOTIN, a classic CHEMICALNOTIN sedative-hypnotic drug. DESIGN: In this double-blind crossover study, each participant received oral doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (16, 80, or 160 mg), CHEMICALNOTIN (0.25, 0.5, or 0.75 mg), and placebo during approximately 18 days. All participants received each treatment on different days. Most outcome measures were assessed at 0.5 hours before drug administration and repeatedly up to 24 hours after drug administration. SETTING: Residential research facility. PARTICIPANTS: Fourteen adults with histories of sedative abuse. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Subject-rated measures included items relevant to potential for abuse (eg, drug liking, street value, and pharmacological classification), as well as assessments of a broad range of stimulant and sedative subjective effects. Observer-rated measures included assessments of sedation and impairment. Motor and cognitive performance measures included psychomotor and memory tasks and a standing balance task. RESULTS: Compared with placebo, CHEMICALNOTIN (16, 80, and 160 mg) showed no significant effect on any of the subjective effect measures, including those related to potential for abuse. In the pharmacological classification, 79% (11/14) of subjects identified the highest dose of CHEMICALNOTIN as placebo. Similarly, compared with placebo, CHEMICALNOTIN had no effect at any dose on any observer-rated or motor and cognitive performance measure. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN showed dose-related effects on a wide range of subject-rated, observer-rated, and motor and cognitive performance measures, consistent with its profile as a sedative drug with abuse liability. CONCLUSION: CHEMICALNOTIN demonstrated no significant effects indicative of potential for abuse or motor and cognitive impairment at up to 20 times the recommended therapeutic dose and may represent a useful alternative to existing insomnia medications.
17016511	Inhibition of cardiac GENENOTIN by grape polyphenols. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The cardiovascular benefits of red wine consumption are often attributed to the antioxidant effects of its polyphenolic constituents, including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Inhibition of cardiac GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective. As polyphenols may also modulate ion channels, and possess structural similarities to several antiarrhythmic GENENOTIN inhibitors, we hypothesised that GENENOTIN inhibition may contribute to cardioprotection by these polyphenols. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The whole-cell voltage-clamp technique was used to record peak and late GENENOTIN currents (INa) from recombinant GENENOTIN channels expressed in tsA201 cells. Right ventricular myocytes from rat heart were isolated and single myocytes were field-stimulated. Either CHEMICALNOTIN transients or contractility were measured using the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive dye CHEMICALNOTIN-Green 1AM or video edge detection, respectively. KEY RESULTS: The red grape polyphenols CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN blocked peak INa with IC50s of 19.4 microM, 76.8 microM and 77.3 microM, respectively. In contrast to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN did not exhibit any frequency-dependence of peak INa block. Late INa induced by the GENEIN long QT mutant GENEIN was reduced by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN also blocked late INa induced by the toxin, ATX II, with IC50s of 26.1 microM and 24.9 microM, respectively. In field-stimulated myocytes, ATXII-induced increases in diastolic CHEMICALNOTIN were prevented and reversed by CHEMICALNOTIN. ATXII-induced contractile dysfunction was delayed and reduced by CHEMICALNOTIN. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Our results indicate that several red grape polyphenols inhibit cardiac GENENOTIN and that this effect may contribute to the documented cardioprotective efficacy of red grape products.
17016621	Enhancement of radiosensitivity by GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells and kinetics of apoptosis and necrosis induction. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and its active metabolite, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), on the sensitivity of human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells to ionizing radiation were investigated in vitro. Further, the kinetics of apoptosis and necrosis induction were also analyzed. The cytocidal effects of X-ray irradiation on A549 cells resulted in a low level of radiosensitivity with a D0 value of 12 Gy. The slopes of the survival curves in the exponential phase were plotted on semilogarithmic paper for radiation combined with CHEMICALNOTIN (2.5 microg/ml) and CHEMICALNOTIN (0.02 microg/ml) treatment, and were shown to be approximately parallel to treatment with irradiation alone. The initial shoulder-shape portion of the survival curve for radiation alone, indicating the repair of sublethal damage, was reduced as compared to that for sequential combined treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Sequential treatments with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN prior to ionizing radiation resulted in an additive radio-enhancement effect that reduced not only survival, but also the shoulder width. Fractionated irradiation with 2 Gy per fraction of A549 cells was carried out in vitro similar to that commonly performed in clinical radiotherapy and the radio-resistance of the cells was shown to be inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Similar to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) are GENEIN inhibitors. The effects of these 4 agents on cells that received X-ray irradiation were compared and all of the agents exhibited comparable radio-enhancement effects. The induction of apoptosis was investigated at 48 and 72 h after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN, radiation or combined treatment, and apoptosis was not significantly induced after any of the treatments. We also examined the induction of necrosis, and found that the incidence of necrosis following combined treatment was approximately 2 times higher than that with either of the single treatments.
17033106	Interaction of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) with Helicobacter pylori in the stomach of humans and experimental animals. Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are major pathogenic factors in peptic ulcer disease but whether these two factors exert synergistic or antagonistic action on the gastric mucosa has been a subject of controversy. The classic concept states that there is an increased ulcer occurrence and bleeding in patients with both H. pylori infection and NSAID use. However, the question whether the H. pylori eradication therapy in NSAID users reduces the occurrence of peptic ulcer has not been fully addressed. Studies on secondary prevention of NSAID-associated ulcers in H. pylori patients have indicated that H. pylori eradication results in impaired ulcer healing with an effect on the rate of peptic ulcer occurrence. On the other hand, the treatment of H. pylori in patients with no prior history of chronic NSAID therapy has been shown to decrease the risk of peptic ulcer. Studies in experimental animals revealed for instance, that the H. pylori infection augments the gastric mucosal damage induced by NSAID in Mongolian gerbils. In rats with preexisting chromic gastric ulcers, H. pylori infection attenuated significantly the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced inhibition of ulcer healing and accompanying fall in the gastric blood flow at the margin of these ulcers, suggesting negative interaction between CHEMICALNOTIN and H. pylori on ulcerogenesis. Accumulated evidence in humans and animals shows that both CHEMICALIN and H. pylori upregulate the expression of GENEIN both at mRNA and protein levels at the ulcer margin, but failed to influence significantly that of GENEIN. It was, therefore, proposed that H. pylori may in fact, antagonize, CHEMICALIN-induced delay of ulcer healing due to suppression of acid secretion by the enhancement in CHEMICALIN possibly derived from GENEIN expression and activity and to the overexpression of growth factors such as GENEIN and GENEIN. The present review summarizes and further addresses the issue of the interaction between these two major ulcer risk factors determined in the stomach of humans and experimental animals.
17041099	The effect of a novel transition state inhibitor of GENENOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN activity. Pemetrexed is a new-generation antifolate inhibitor of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and a weaker inhibitor of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) required for de novo CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis. GENEIN (GENEIN) salvages CHEMICALNOTIN by releasing CHEMICALIN from CHEMICALIN and is often deleted in mesothelioma. The current study addresses the effect of GENENOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN activity using a highly potent transition state inhibitor of GENENOTIN, MT-DADMe-Immucillin A (ImmA; K(i) = 86 pmol/L) in the GENENOTIN(+) NCI-H28 and GENENOTIN(-) NCI-H2052 mesothelioma cell lines. Based on selective nucleoside protection, GENEIN was found to be the primary CHEMICALIN target in both cell lines with GENEIN inhibition requiring 20- to 30-fold higher CHEMICALIN concentrations. ImmA had no effect on CHEMICALNOTIN activity but, when CHEMICALNOTIN was added, the CHEMICALNOTIN IC(50) decreased by a factor of approximately 3 in GENENOTIN(+) H28 cells with no effect in GENENOTIN(-) H2052 cells. Conversely, the transfection of GENENOTIN into H2052 cells increased the CHEMICALNOTIN IC(50) by nearly 3-fold but only in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN; this was reversed by ImmA. An GENENOTIN-specific short interfering RNA produced a 2-fold decrease in CHEMICALNOTIN IC(50) in GENENOTIN(+) HeLa cells in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. These data indicate that suppression of constitutive GENENOTIN has no effect on CHEMICALIN activity when the primary target is GENEIN. There is a modest salutary effect when the CHEMICALIN target is GENEIN alone.
17082235	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN exhibit GENEIN activity: a combined virtual screening and biological assay approach. Most drugs currently employed in the treatment of type 2 diabetes either target the GENEIN stimulating GENEIN release (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), or target the GENEIN (GENEIN) improving GENENOTIN resistance (CHEMICALIN). Our work shows that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN additionally bind to GENEIN and exhibit GENEIN agonistic activity. This activity was predicted in silico by virtual screening and confirmed in vitro in a binding assay, a transactivation assay, and by measuring the expression of GENENOTIN target genes. Among the measured compounds, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (two CHEMICALIN), as well as CHEMICALIN (a CHEMICALIN), exhibit GENEIN agonistic activity at concentrations comparable with those reached under pharmacological treatment. The most active of these compounds, CHEMICALIN, is shown to be as potent as CHEMICALIN at inducing GENEIN target gene expression. This dual mode of action of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN may open new perspectives for the molecular pharmacology of antidiabetic drugs, because it provides evidence that drugs can be designed that target both the GENEIN and GENEIN. Targeting both receptors could increase pancreatic GENENOTIN secretion and improve GENENOTIN resistance. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and other CHEMICALIN may be promising leads in the development of new GENEIN agonists. In addition, we provide a unified concept of the GENENOTIN binding ability of seemingly disparate compound classes.
17088426	CHEMICALNOTIN stimulation of HEK293 cells generates multiple contiguous domains with different [CHEMICALNOTIN]: role of compartmentalized phosphodiesterases. There is a growing appreciation that the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-GENEIN (GENEIN) signaling pathway is organized to form transduction units that function to deliver specific messages. Such organization results in the local activation of GENEIN subsets through the generation of confined intracellular gradients of CHEMICALIN, but the mechanisms responsible for limiting the diffusion of CHEMICALNOTIN largely remain to be clarified. In this study, by performing real-time imaging of CHEMICALNOTIN, we show that CHEMICALNOTIN stimulation generates multiple contiguous, intracellular domains with different CHEMICALNOTIN concentration in human embryonic kidney 293 cells. By using pharmacological and genetic manipulation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), we demonstrate that compartmentalized GENEIN and GENEIN are responsible for selectively modulating the concentration of CHEMICALIN in individual subcellular compartments. We propose a model whereby compartmentalized GENEIN, rather than representing an enzymatic barrier to CHEMICALNOTIN diffusion, act as a sink to drain the second messenger from discrete locations, resulting in multiple and simultaneous domains with different CHEMICALIN concentrations irrespective of their distance from the site of CHEMICALIN synthesis.
17089011	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors up-regulate GENENOTIN gene expression in SK-Br3 breast cancer cells: in vitro evidence for a 'functional amplicon' involving GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the key metabolic multi-enzyme that is responsible for the terminal catalytic step in the de novo fatty acid biosynthesis, plays an active role in the development, maintenance, and enhancement of the malignant phenotype in a subset of breast carcinomas. We recently described that a molecular bi-directional cross-talk between GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) oncogene is taking place at the level of transcription, translation, and activity in breast cancer cells. Because GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN has been linked with altered sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs, we envisioned that GENENOTIN gene expression may represent a novel predictive molecular factor for breast cancer response to chemotherapy in a GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-related manner. We herein evaluated whether chemotherapy-induced cell damage acts in an epigenetic fashion by inducing changes in the transcriptional activation of GENENOTIN gene in breast cancer cells. To evaluate this option, GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-overexpressing SK-Br3 breast cancer cells were transiently transfected with a GENENOTIN-reporter construct (GENENOTIN-Luciferase) harboring all the elements necessary for high level expression in cancer cells. SK-Br3 cells cultured in the presence of GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) demonstrated a 2- to 3-fold increase in GENEIN activity when compared with control cells growing in drug-free culture conditions. We failed to observe any significant activation of GENEIN following exposure to the anti-metabolite CHEMICALIN, the alkylating drug CHEMICALIN, or the microtubule interfering-agents CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Moreover, the up-regulatory effects of GENENOTIN inhibitors on the transcriptional activation of GENENOTIN gene expression were not significantly decreased when the GENENOTIN was damaged at the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-binding site. Considering that GENENOTIN inhibition produces profound inhibition of DNA replication and S-phase progression in cancer cells, we finally asked whether a cross-talk between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN could exhibit a GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-related bi-directional nature. GENENOTIN protein levels were decreased during treatment with the anti-GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN antibody trastuzumab while, concomitantly, GENENOTIN activity and GENENOTIN protein expression were significantly reduced. Of note, when the expression levels of GENENOTIN protein were analyzed following exposure of SK-Br3 cells to increasing concentrations of the novel slow-binding GENENOTIN inhibitor C75, a dose-dependent reduction in GENENOTIN expression was observed. Although GENENOTIN gene is not physically located in the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN amplicon, our present findings strongly suggest that a tight functional association between GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes is taking place in a subset of breast carcinoma cells.
17094978	CHEMICALIN alters expression of endometrial GENEIN and their cofactors in new users of CHEMICALNOTIN. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of mifepristone on the expression of endometrial GENENOTIN and their co-factors in depot CHEMICALNOTIN (DMPA) users. DESIGN: A prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Reproductive research center. PATIENT(S): Fifty healthy women with regular menstrual cycle. INTERVENTION(S): One hundred fifty milligrams of DMPA were given every 3 months. Two pills (25 mg each) of placebo or CHEMICALNOTIN were administered every 14 days during the DMPA therapy. Four endometrial biopsy specimens were obtained from each patient. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN messenger RNA and protein was detected by real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), silencing mediator for GENENOTIN, and cell proliferation were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. RESULT(S): The expression of endometrial GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN was increased significantly after 1 week of CHEMICALIN, but the increase was no longer seen after 10 weeks. A positive correlation between endometrial GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN production and proliferation was demonstrated. CONCLUSION(S): Short-term exposure of CHEMICALIN in new starters of DMPA increases the expression of endometrial GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN and promotes cell proliferation. Prolonged exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN does not alter the suppression of these receptors that are caused by DMPA and continues to result in endometrial atrophy.
17097861	Characterization of the molecular mechanisms involved in the increased GENENOTIN secretion in rats with acute liver failure. To investigate the mechanism of hyperinsulinaemia in rats with acute liver failure induced by the administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), we focused on the role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in islet GENENOTIN synthesis. Recent reports indicate that GENENOTIN binds and stabilizes mRNA encoding GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN. In the present study, CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN secretion was significantly increased in CHEMICALIN-treated rats compared to controls. Levels of mRNA encoding GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENENOTIN were increased in the pancreatic islets of CHEMICALIN-treated rats. This mRNA level elevation was not prevented by pretreatment with CHEMICALNOTIN. When the GENEIN in GENEIN mRNA was incubated with the islet cytosolic fraction, the RNA-protein complex level was increased in the cytosolic fraction obtained from CHEMICALIN-treated rats compared to the level in control rats. The cytosolic fraction obtained from pancreatic islets obtained from CHEMICALIN-treated rats had an increased GENEIN level compared to the levels obtained from the pancreatic islets of control rats. These findings suggest that, in rats with acute liver failure, cytosolic GENENOTIN binds and stabilizes mRNA encoding GENENOTIN and its GENENOTIN.
17112405	GENEIN is involved in CHEMICALIN-mediated neuronal injury in mice. AIM: To determine whether GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is involved in CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced excitotoxic injury in the mouse brain. METHODS: Brain injury was induced by CHEMICALNOTIN microinjection (50-150 nmol in 0.5 microL) into the cerebral cortex. The changes in GENEIN expression 24 h after CHEMICALIN injection and the effects of a GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg), an GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg), and an antioxidant, CHEMICALNOTIN (9 mg/kg) were observed. RESULTS: In the CHEMICALIN-injured brain, the GENEIN mRNA, and protein expression were upregulated, and the receptor was mainly localized in the neurons and not in the astrocytes. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN decreased CHEMICALNOTIN-induced injury; CHEMICALIN (0.1 mg/kg) and CHEMICALIN inhibited the upregulated expression of the GENEIN. CONCLUSION: GENEIN expression in neurons is upregulated after CHEMICALIN injection, and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced responses are inhibited by GENENOTIN antagonists, indicating that the increased GENEIN is involved in CHEMICALIN excitotoxicity.
17119350	GENENOTIN phosphorylation has pathological significance in human breast cancer. The anti-apoptotic molecule, GENENOTIN, is well known to play an important role in the chemoresistance of breast cancer. We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN) at 194 CHEMICALIN through GENEIN (GENEIN) activation sensitizes breast cancer cells to chemotherapy through accelerating cell cycle arrest at G2/M, and that GENEIN phosphorylation downstream of GENEIN/GENEIN plays an important role in cell growth suppression by CHEMICALIN. In this study, the clinicopathological association of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) with GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN expressions and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) was analyzed immunohistochemically using 107 human breast cancer specimens. Expression of GENENOTIN was found to significantly correlate with lymphatic invasion, lymph node metastasis, but not histological differentiation, tumor grade or vascular and fatty invasion. The positivity of GENENOTIN was also significantly correlated to that of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN. Thus, GENENOTIN as well as the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN parameter might be useful markers for cancer progression, independent of the hormone receptor status, in human breast cancers.
1712335	Studies on the mechanism of arterial vasodilation produced by the novel antihypertensive agent, CHEMICALNOTIN. The mechanism(s) responsible for arterial vasodilation observed following acute administration of CHEMICALIN, a novel vasodilator/GENEIN antagonist, has been investigated in rats. In conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats, CHEMICALNOTIN (0.03-3.0 mg/kg, iv) produced a dose-dependent reduction in blood pressure with no significant effect on heart rate. Because cardiac output was relatively unaffected, the antihypertensive response of CHEMICALNOTIN was associated with a dose-dependent reduction in total peripheral vascular resistance. Submaximal antihypertensive doses of CHEMICALNOTIN were chosen for mechanism of action studies in pithed rats. CHEMICALIN (0.3 mg/kg, iv) produced a significant inhibition of the GENEIN mediated positive chronotropic response to CHEMICALIN. This same dose of CHEMICALIN also inhibited, but to a lesser degree, the GENEIN mediated vasodepressor response to CHEMICALIN in pithed rats whose blood pressure was elevated by a constant intravenous infusion of GENENOTIN. Thus, CHEMICALIN blocks both GENENOTIN at antihypertensive doses, with modest selectivity being observed for the GENEIN subtype. CHEMICALIN produced significant inhibition of the GENEIN mediated pressor response to CHEMICALIN in the pithed rat, but had no effect on the GENEIN mediated pressor response to CHEMICALIN, suggesting that CHEMICALIN is also an GENEIN antagonist at antihypertensive doses. CHEMICALIN had no effect on the pressor response elicited by GENEIN, indicating a lack of nonspecific vasodilator activity. The vasopressor response to the GENEIN activator, CHEMICALIN, which is mediated through the opening of GENEIN and the subsequent translocation of extracellular CHEMICALIN, was significantly inhibited by CHEMICALIN (1 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that CHEMICALIN is also a GENEIN antagonist, consistent with our previous in vitro studies. In anesthetized spontaneously hypertensive rats, the antihypertensive activity of CHEMICALNOTIN was nearly abolished by combined pretreatment of the rats with high doses of the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (1 mg/kg, iv), and the nonselective GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (3 mg/kg, iv), suggesting that the majority of the antihypertensive response produced by CHEMICALNOTIN may be accounted for by blockade of GENENOTIN. We therefore conclude that CHEMICALIN, at antihypertensive doses, is an antagonist of GENENOTIN, and also of GENEIN in vascular smooth muscle.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
17126311	Clinical, biochemical and molecular diagnosis of a compound homozygote for the 254 bp deletion-8 bp insertion of the APRT gene suffering from severe renal failure. OBJECTIVE: To determine the type of mutation in a patient with clinical diagnosis of suspected APRT deficiency. DESIGN AND METHODS: A 51-year-old male patient, with a clinical history of two prior episodes of renal colic with urinary stone excretion (reported as uric acid stones in the first episode and as calcium oxalate stones in the second), was admitted to the hospital with severe non-oliguric renal failure (1.06 mmol/L serum creatinine), severe hyponatremia (114 mmol/L Na(+)), metabolic acidosis (14 mmol/L HCO(3)(-)) and uricemia in the normal range. Abnormalities at renal scan and persistency of severe renal failure required to start haemodialysis. Results of renal biopsy prompted us to undertake a biochemical and molecular biological evaluation of the patient for suspected adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) deficiency. RESULTS: HPLC analysis of serum and urine, for determining purine derivative profile, showed the pathological presence of adenine in both biological fluids (3.57 micromol/L and 7.11 micromol/mmol creatinine in serum and urine, respectively; not detectable in both fluids in healthy controls). APRT assay in a sample of patient hemolysate showed no detectable activity of the enzyme (25.56+/-9.55 U/L red blood cells in control healthy subjects). Molecular biological analysis of the amplified APRT gene revealed that the patient harboured in exon 3 a homozygous 254 bp deletion-8 bp insertion, previously described only once in a compound heterozygote. Analysis of the patient family showed that heterozygotes for this APRT gene mutation, in spite of a 69% lower APRT enzymatic activity than that of healthy subjects, had no detectable adenine concentrations in both serum and urine. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the first patient harbouring the homozygous 254 bp deletion-8 bp insertion of the APRT gene strongly indicated that definitive diagnosis of APRT deficiency (often under or misdiagnosed) would require a combined clinical, biochemical and molecular biological evaluation.
17128263	Phospholipase Cgamma1 negatively regulates growth hormone signalling by forming a ternary complex with Jak2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B. Growth hormone binds to its membrane receptor (GHR), whereby it regulates many cellular functions, including proliferation, differentiation and chemotaxis. However, although the activation of growth hormone-mediated signalling is well understood, the precise mechanism responsible for its regulation has not been elucidated. Here, we demonstrate that phospholipase Cgamma1 (PLCgamma1) modulates the action of growth hormone-mediated signalling by interacting with tyrosine kinase Jak2 (janus kinase 2) in a growth hormone-dependent manner. In the absence of PLCgamma1 (PLCgamma1(-/-)), growth hormone-induced JAK2 and STAT5 phosphorylation significantly increased in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Furthermore, the re-expression of PLCgamma1 reduced growth hormone-induced Jak2 activation. Growth hormone-induced Jak2 phosphorylation was enhanced by siRNA-specific knockdown of PLCgamma1. Interestingly, PLCgamma1 physically linked Jak2 and protein tyrosine phosphatase-1B (PTP-1B) by binding to both using different domains, and this process was implicated in the modulation of cytokine signalling through Jak2. In addition, in PLCgamma1(-/-) MEFs, growth hormone-dependent c-Fos activation was upregulated and growth hormone-induced proliferation was potentiated. These results suggest that PLCgamma1 has a key function in the regulation of growth hormone-mediated signalling by negatively regulating Jak2 activation.
17138606	Increased responsiveness of rat colonic splanchnic afferents to CHEMICALNOTIN after inflammation and recovery. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) activates colonic splanchnic afferents, a mechanism by which it has been implicated in generating symptoms in postinfectious and postinflammatory states in humans. Here we compared mechanisms of colonic afferent activation by CHEMICALNOTIN and mechanical stimuli in normal and inflamed rat colon, and after recovery from inflammation. Colonic inflammation was induced in rats by CHEMICALNOTIN. Single-fibre recordings of colonic lumbar splanchnic afferents revealed that 58% of endings responded to CHEMICALNOTIN (10(-4) m) in controls, 88% in acute inflammation (P<0.05) and 75% after 21 days recovery (P < 0.05 versus control). Maximal responses to CHEMICALNOTIN were also larger, and the estimated EC50 was reduced from 3.2 x 10(-6) to 8 x 10(-7) m in acute inflammation and recovered to 2 x 10(-6) m after recovery. Responsiveness to mechanical stimulation was unaffected. GENEIN antagonism with CHEMICALIN reduced responses to CHEMICALIN in controls but not during inflammation. Responses to the mast cell degranulator 48/80 mimicked those to CHEMICALNOTIN in inflamed tissue but not in controls, and more CHEMICALNOTIN-containing mast cells were seen close to GENENOTIN-containing fibres in inflamed serosa. We conclude that colonic serosal and mesenteric endings exhibit increased sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN in inflammation, with both an increase in proportion of responders and an increase in sensitivity, which is maintained after healing of inflammation. This is associated with alterations in the roles of GENENOTIN and mast cells.
17138644	The role of extranuclear signaling actions of GENEIN in mediating CHEMICALIN regulation of gene expression and the cell cycle. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) contains a motif that interacts with the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN and mediates rapid activation of GENENOTIN and downstream GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) without relying on the transcriptional activity of the receptor. Here we investigated the role and intracellular location of this nontranscriptional activity of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN activation of GENEIN/GENEIN occurred outside the nucleus with the GENEIN that was distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus, but not with GENEIN that was predominantly nuclear. Breast cancer cells stably expressing wild-type GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN with disrupting point mutations in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) that do not affect the transcriptional activity of GENENOTIN, were compared for effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on endogenous target gene expression and cell proliferation. CHEMICALIN induction of the GENEIN gene, which lacks a GENENOTIN, was dependent on GENEIN activation of the GENEIN/GENEIN pathway, whereas induction of the GENEIN (GENEIN) gene that contains a functional GENENOTIN was unaffected by mutations that interfere with GENENOTIN activation of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN induction of cell cycle progression was also abrogated in cells expressing GENENOTIN, and no effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN expression and cell cycle was observed in the presence of GENEIN. These results highlight the importance of GENEIN activation of the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway for CHEMICALIN-induced transcription of select target genes and cell cycle progression.
17146052	Seizures and enhanced cortical GABAergic inhibition in two mouse models of human autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy. Selected mutations in the GENENOTIN subunit genes cosegregate with a partial epilepsy syndrome known as autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE). To examine possible mechanisms underlying this inherited epilepsy, we engineered two ADNFLE mutations (GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN(+L264)) in mice. Heterozygous ADNFLE mutant mice show persistent, abnormal cortical electroencephalograms with prominent delta and theta frequencies, exhibit frequent spontaneous seizures, and show an increased sensitivity to the proconvulsant action of CHEMICALNOTIN. Relative to WT, electrophysiological recordings from ADNFLE mouse layer II/III cortical pyramidal cells reveal a >20-fold increase in CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents with no effect on excitatory postsynaptic currents. i.p. injection of a subthreshold dose of CHEMICALIN, a use-dependent GENEIN antagonist, reduces cortical electroencephalogram delta power and transiently inhibits spontaneous seizure activity in ADNFLE mutant mice. Our studies suggest that the mechanism underlying ADNFLE seizures may involve inhibitory synchronization of cortical networks via activation of mutant GENENOTIN located on the presynaptic terminals and somatodendritic compartments of cortical GABAergic interneurons.
17150756	Molecular recognition of histidine tRNA by histidyl-tRNA synthetase from hyperthermophilic archaeon, Aeropyrum pernix K1. To investigate the recognition sites of histidine tRNA for histidyl-tRNA synthetase from an extreme hyperthermophilic archaeon, Aeropyrum pernix K1, we examined histidylation activities by using overexpressed histidyl-tRNA synthetase and various histidine tRNA transcripts that were prepared by in vitro transcription system. Results indicated that anticodon was not recognized by the histidyl-tRNA synthetase similar to that of Escherichia coli histidine tRNA recognition system. Discriminator base C73 was weekly recognized and an additional G residue was specifically recognized by the enzyme.
17154506	Synthesis, radiosynthesis, and biological evaluation of CHEMICALIN: candidate radioligands for in vivo imaging of the GENEIN with positron emission tomography. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, 1) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, 2) were synthesized and evaluated for binding to the GENENOTIN (GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, respectively) using transfected cells. Both 1 and 2 have a high affinity for the GENENOTIN (Ki=0.2 nM) and are approximately 160 times more selective for the GENENOTIN than the GENENOTIN. Compound 2 has a significantly higher affinity for the GENENOTIN than 1, and this may be a result of the different size and electronegativity of the CHEMICALNOTIN atoms. MicroPET imaging in nonhuman primates with [CHEMICALIN]1 and [CHEMICALIN]2 demonstrated that both tracers behave similarly in vivo with high uptake being observed in the GENEIN-rich brain regions and peak uptake being achieved in about 55 min postinjection. Chase studies with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN demonstrated that this uptake is the result of preferential binding to the GENEIN.
17163232	Pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN plus CHEMICALNOTIN combination in healthy subjects. BACKGROUND: Hypertension treatment guidelines recommend combination therapy with diuretics and other antihypertensive agents, including GENENOTIN antagonists. This trial investigated the possibility of pharmacokinetic interactions between the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN diuretic CHEMICALNOTIN in healthy subjects. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy normotensive adult male subjects underwent three consecutive 7-day treatment periods (A, B and C, respectively) during which they were randomised to receive: CHEMICALNOTIN 20 mg once daily (regimen A), CHEMICALNOTIN 25 mg once daily (regimen B), or CHEMICALNOTIN 20 mg once daily plus CHEMICALNOTIN 25 mg once daily (regimen C). Treatment periods were separated by washouts of 7-14 days. The primary pharmacokinetic parameters evaluated were: the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve at steady state (AUCss,tau), the maximum plasma concentration at steady state (Css,max), and the time at which Css,max occurred (tmax). RESULTS: Complete data sets from 17 subjects were available for pharmacokinetic analyses. Mean concentration versus time profiles were similar for monotherapy and combination treatment for both CHEMICALNOTIN (the active metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN. For CHEMICALNOTIN, comparison of monotherapy with combination therapy showed that for AUCss,tau and Css,max point estimates were close to unity, demonstrating bioequivalence. For CHEMICALNOTIN, combination therapy resulted in decreases in AUCss,tau and Css,max of approximately 10% versus monotherapy; nevertheless, since 90% CIs were within the acceptance range, bioequivalence was proven. Median tmax values for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN for periods A, B and C were identical, indicating bioequivalence. Both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were well tolerated. CONCLUSION: These results show that there is little or no potential for a clinically relevant pharmacokinetic interaction between CHEMICALNOTIN 20 mg and CHEMICALNOTIN 25 mg, and therefore dosage adjustment should not be necessary when they are co-administered.
17179482	Effect of cromolyn on GENENOTIN interactions with RAGE and pancreatic cancer growth and invasion in mouse models. BACKGROUND: We previously found that GENENOTIN, a member of the GENENOTIN protein family, is expressed in more than 90% of pancreatic tumors and is associated with tumor growth and invasion. In the current study, we investigated the ability of the antiallergy drug, cromolyn, to block GENENOTIN function. METHODS: Interactions between cromolyn and GENENOTIN were investigated using a drug affinity column and by examining cromolyn's effects on coimmunoprecipitation of GENENOTIN and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE). The effects of cromolyn on cell growth, invasion, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity of pancreatic cancer cells with (BxPC-3 and MPanc-96) and without (Panc-1) endogenous GENENOTIN were investigated by cell proliferation assay, by cell invasion assay, and by luciferase reporter gene assay, respectively. The effects of cromolyn on tumor growth in vivo were investigated in three orthotopic models (n = 20 mice per model) by administration of cromolyn (5 mg/kg body weight, daily) with and without CHEMICALNOTIN (125 mg/kg body weight, biweekly), the drug currently used to treat pancreatic cancer. Tumor growth was assayed by reporter gene expression. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: GENENOTIN was retained on a cromolyn affinity column. Cromolyn blocked the coimmunoprecipitation of GENENOTIN and RAGE. In vitro, cromolyn (100 microM) inhibited GENENOTIN-stimulated Panc-1 cell proliferation (GENENOTIN, mean = 0.93 U, versus GENENOTIN + cromolyn, mean = 0.56 U, difference = 0.37 U; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.24 to 0.49 U; P = .001, n = 3), invasion (GENENOTIN, mean = 58.0%, versus GENENOTIN + cromolyn, mean = 9.4%, difference = 48.6%; 95% CI = 38.8% to 58.8%; P<.001, n = 3), and GENENOTIN activity (GENENOTIN, mean = 14,460, versus GENENOTIN + cromolyn, mean = 7360 photons/s, difference = 7100 photons/s; 95% CI = 3689 to 10 510 photons/s; P = .005, n = 3). In vivo, cromolyn inhibited tumor growth in mice bearing tumor with endogenous GENEIN (BxPC-3: control, mean = 1.6 x 10(9) photons/s, versus cromolyn, mean = 4.4 x 10(8) photons/s, difference = 1.2 x 10(9) photons/s; 95% CI = 6.2 x 10(8) to 1.6 x 10(9) photons/s; P<.001, n = 5; MPanc-96: control, mean = 1.1 x 10(10) photons/s, versus cromolyn, mean = 4.8 x 10(9) photons/s, difference = 6.2 x 10(9) photons/s; 95% CI = 1.9 x 10(9) to 1.0 x 10(10) photons/s; P = .009, n = 5) and increased the effectiveness of CHEMICALIN (BxPC-3: CHEMICALIN, mean = 9.2 x 10(8) photons/s, versus combination, mean = 1.8 x 10(8) photons/s, difference = 7.4 x 10(8) photons/s; 95% CI = 4.5 x 10(8) to 1.0 x 10(9) photons/s; P<.001; MPanc-96: CHEMICALNOTIN, mean = 4.1 x 10(9) photons/s, versus combination, mean = 2.0 x 10(9) photons/s, difference = 2.1 x 10(9) photons/s; 95% CI = 4.4 x 10(8) to 3.8 x 10(9) photons/s; P<.001). However, cromolyn had no effect on growth of tumors lacking GENENOTIN (Panc-1). CONCLUSION: Cromolyn binds GENEIN, prevents activation of RAGE, inhibits tumor growth, and increases the effectiveness of CHEMICALIN in experimental models.
17181859	Genetic polymorphisms in the cyclooxygenase-2 gene, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and breast cancer risk. INTRODUCTION: The association between use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and breast cancer risk remains unclear. Inconsistencies in previously reported findings may be partly due to differences in expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. We hypothesized that genetic polymorphisms (COX-2 .926, COX-2 .5209, and COX-2 .8473) may reduce overall breast cancer risk or risk for subtypes of breast cancer by modulating the inflammatory response and may interact with aspirin or any NSAID use. METHODS: We conducted a population-based, case-control study in which we genotyped 1,067 breast cancer cases and 1,110 control individuals included in the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project. RESULTS: No major effects of the three COX-2 variant alleles on breast cancer risk were found. A total of eight distinct haplotypes and 18 diplotypes were observed in the population. Overall, no significant associations between COX-2 haplotypes/diplotypes and breast cancer risk were observed. Among women who used aspirin or any NSAID there was little evidence for an interaction with the at-risk COX-2 genotypes, with one exception. Among women with hormone receptor positive breast cancer, the reduced risk for any NSAID use was only evident among those who had at least one variant C allele of COX-2 .8473 (odds ratio = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.5 to 1.0; P for the interaction = 0.02). There was no corresponding interaction for aspirin use, possibly because of limited power. CONCLUSION: These data provide modest evidence that the C allele of COX-2 .8473 may interact with NSAIDs to reduce risk for hormone receptor positive breast cancer.
17194211	Biosynthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN on its tRNA in eukaryotes. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is cotranslationally inserted into protein in response to GENENOTIN codons and is the 21st CHEMICALNOTIN in the genetic code. However, the means by which CHEMICALNOTIN is synthesized in eukaryotes is not known. Herein, comparative genomics and experimental analyses revealed that the GENEIN (GENEIN) is the previously identified CHEMICALIN-containing protein known as the GENEIN. GENEIN required CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN-tRNA([Ser]Sec) as substrates to generate CHEMICALIN-tRNA([Ser]Sec). Moreover, it was found that CHEMICALNOTIN was synthesized on the tRNA scaffold from CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN using tRNA([Ser]Sec), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. By identifying the pathway of CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis in mammals, this study not only functionally characterized GENENOTIN but also assigned the function of the GENENOTIN. In addition, we found that GENEIN could synthesize CHEMICALIN in vitro but GENEIN could not. Conservation of the overall pathway of Sec biosynthesis suggests that this pathway is also active in other eukaryotes and archaea that synthesize GENENOTIN.
17194886	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in a rat model of cerebral ischemia. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia. CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN, and its active metabolite CHEMICALIN may inhibit apoptosis and inflammation after cerebral ischemia. An in vivo model of cerebral ischemia was used to investigate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN treatment on infarct volume, and inflammation after cerebral ischemia in the rat. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were subjected to a permanent right-sided middle cerebral artery occlusion. Rats received oral administration of either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. After 3 days after surgery, immunostaining was used to detect neuroinflammatory cells and molecules, and infarct volumes were measured. RESULTS: Both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN at a dose of 30 mg/kg but not 10 mg/kg significantly reduced infarct volume compared with vehicle treatment. Middle cerebral artery occlusion resulted in increased astrocyte and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) immunostaining in the ipsilateral cortex. CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg) or CHEMICALIN treatment (30 mg/kg) did not reduce the levels of GENEIN or GENEIN immunostaining. CHEMICALIN (30 mg/kg) also significantly decreased the protein levels of GENEIN but not GENEIN or GENEIN in the cortex ipsilateral to the middle cerebral artery occlusion. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN appear to be equally neuroprotective against middle cerebral artery occlusion-induced cerebral ischemia. Therefore, strong rationale exists to continue the neuroprotective examination of CHEMICALNOTIN in brain injury.
17203585	Differential expression of glycans in the hippocampus of rats trained on an inhibitory learning paradigm. The glycan chains of glycoconjugates play important roles in cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. In the CNS, previous studies on learning and memory suggest the importance of oligosaccharides attached to glycoconjugates in the modulation of synaptic connections. We studied the hippocampal glycan distribution of rats subject to an inhibitory avoidance task. The expression of glycans was examined by lectin-histochemistry using Vicia villosa lectin (VVL) for terminal alpha/beta N-acetylgalactosamine (alpha/beta GalNAc); Galanthus nivalus lectin (GNL) for terminal mannose alpha-1,3 (Man alpha-1,3); Peanut agglutinin (PNA) for galactose beta-1,3N-acetylgalactosamine (Gal beta-1,3 GalNAc); Erythrina cristagalli lectin (ECL) for galactose beta-1,4 N-acetylglucosamine (Gal beta-1,4 GlcNAc); Sambucus nigra lectin (SNA) for sialic acid alpha-2.6 galactose (SA alpha-2,6 Gal); Maackia amurensis lectin II (MAL II) for sialic acid alpha-2,3 (SA alpha-2,3); Wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) for terminal N-acetylglucosamine with/ without sialic acid (GlcNAc wo SA); succynilated WGA (sWGA) for terminal N-acetylglucosamine without sialic acid (terminal GlcNAc without SA); Griffonia simplicifolia lectin II (GSL II) for terminal alpha/beta N-acetylglucosamine (alpha/beta GlcNAc terminal); and Lotus tetragonolobus lectin (LTL) alpha-fucose. Two groups of 10 animals were examined: non-trained (Control) and Trained rats. ECL, sWGA and GSL II were negative for both groups in all the hippocampal subfields studied. For both groups, VVL was negative in CA4 and granular cells of the Dentate Gyrus (DG) and LTL was negative in the CA4 subfield. Expression of alpha/beta GalNAc, alpha-fucose and GlcNAc in other hippocampal subflields was positive, with no differences between groups. However, expression of Man alpha-1,3 was significantly higher in the CA1, CA2, CA3, and CA4 subfields in the Trained group. On the other hand, expression of Gal beta-1,3 GalNAc was significantly low in CA4 and DG in the Trained group. In conclusion, the results here presented indicate that the exposure of rats to an associative behavioral paradigm related to declarative memory, involves some regulatory mechanism/s for the differential patterns of glycan expression.
17207582	CHEMICALIN stimulates GENEIN degradation by GENEIN-GENEIN system to regulate surface expression of GENEIN. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a scaffolding protein in postsynaptic density (PSD), tethering GENENOTIN to other signaling proteins. Here we report that CHEMICALIN stimulation caused a rapid reduction in protein levels of GENEIN, but not that of CHEMICALNOTIN receptor GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN) in rat primary cortical neuron cultures. Down-regulation of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN was blocked by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a GENEIN inhibitor and by expression of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN, a dominant negative form of GENENOTIN. The GENEIN reduction was inhibited by CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN antagonist, but not by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an GENEIN antagonist. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), two CHEMICALNOTIN chelators, but not CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN blocker, prevented GENEIN degradation. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN prevented CHEMICALIN-stimulated reduction in surface amount of GENEIN, and knockdown of GENENOTIN by RNAi against GENENOTIN reduced surface GENENOTIN in neurons. Our results suggest that CHEMICALIN induces GENEIN degradation by GENEIN through an GENEIN-CHEMICALNOTIN pathway and that GENEIN degradation may play an important role in regulating GENEIN surface expression.
17207992	Transgenic expression of the human Vitamin D receptor (hVDR) in the duodenum of VDR-null mice attenuates the age-dependent decline in calcium absorption. 1,25(OH)(2)D(3) regulates calcium homeostasis through its actions in the intestine, bone, and kidney. These actions are mediated through the VDR. To determine if VDR's actions in the proximal small intestine can sufficiently restore calcium homeostasis, we generated transgenic mice expressing hVDR exclusively in the duodenum of mVDR-null mice by using the adenosine deaminase enhancer (hVDR+/mVDR-null). Unlike wild-type mice, hVDR+/mVDR-null mice express hVDR and VDR target genes only in the proximal small intestine. Despite having functional hVDR in the proximal small intestine, hVDR+/mVDR-null mice were hypocalcaemic when fed a normal rodent diet at weaning, like mVDR-null mice fed the same diet. The hypocalcemia in these mice is prevented if they are given the rescue diet before weaning. However, when 90-day-old rachitic mice were fed a rescue diet, serum calcium improved in hVDR+/mVDR-null mice, but not in mVDR-null mice. In conclusion, transgenic hVDR in the proximal small intestine of hVDR+/mVDR-null mice was transcriptionally active and regulated calcium absorption, but VDR actions elsewhere in the intestine are probably necessary to support adequate calcium homeostasis. In addition, hVDR+/mVDR-null mice responded better to the late rescue diet suggesting that expression of VDR in the proximal small intestine protected the calcium absorbing machinery from age-dependent decline.
17223000	The inhibitory effect of the GENENOTIN antagonist on CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN gene expression and GENEIN secretion in human airway epithelial cells. OBJECTIVES: GENENOTIN gene expression and GENENOTIN production are markedly increased in inflammatory airway disorders such as asthma, chronic bronchitis and rhinosinusitis. GENENOTIN, lipopolysaccharides and other inflammatory mediators such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are related to the secretion and production of GENEIN. However, the relationship of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN genes expression is not clear. The aim of this study is to evaluate GENENOTIN gene expression and GENENOTIN secretion by the GENENOTIN in human airway epithelial cells. METHODS: The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on the regulation of GENENOTIN gene expression and GENENOTIN secretion were observed in human airway NCI-H292 epithelial cells. The mRNA levels of GENENOTIN and the amount of GENENOTIN were determined by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoassay. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN upregulated GENEIN gene expression and GENEIN secretion in a dose dependent pattern. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, 100 microM) downregulated the CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN gene expression and GENEIN secretion. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the GENENOTIN system is one of the mechanisms related to GENENOTIN gene expression and GENENOTIN secretion in the human airway epithelium.
17224860	Effect of isolated CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation on GENENOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN efflux potential in postmenopausal women. OBJECTIVE: CHEMICALNOTIN may display beneficial health effects in postmenopausal women. We studied in a clinical trial whether isolated CHEMICALIN treatment in postmenopausal women could affect reverse CHEMICALNOTIN transport as evaluated by GENEIN- (GENEIN), dependent CHEMICALIN efflux from macrophages. In addition, various serum lipid and GENENOTIN parameters were investigated. Furthermore, we separately assessed equol-producing and non-equol-producing women. DESIGN: Postmenopausal women (n=56) were treated with either CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo tablets for 3 months in a crossover design, separated by a 2-month washout period. Fifteen women were classified as equol producers, and 15 women were classified as non-equol producers. Serum samples were collected before and after each treatment period. CHEMICALNOTIN-labeled J774 macrophage cells, with and without GENENOTIN up-regulation, were incubated with the samples, and GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN efflux and serum lipid and GENENOTIN levels were assessed. RESULTS: Serum promoted 3.1%+/-1.1% and 3.2%+/-1.1% CHEMICALNOTIN efflux from macrophages after CHEMICALNOTIN and placebo treatment, respectively. Thus, CHEMICALIN supplementation did not affect GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN efflux to serum. However, as a novel finding, CHEMICALIN treatment increased a subclass of GENEIN, the GENEIN levels by 18% without affecting any other serum lipid concentrations. GENEIN-facilitated CHEMICALIN efflux and lipid parameters did not differ between CHEMICALNOTIN-producing and non-CHEMICALNOTIN-producing women. CONCLUSION: In postmenopausal women, isolated CHEMICALIN treatment does not affect GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN efflux potential from macrophages but increases circulating GENEIN level, which could provide beneficial vascular effects.
17229632	The ability of CHEMICALIN to inhibit oncogenic GENEIN and GENEIN mutants and overcome resistance to other small molecule inhibitors. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Activated GENENOTIN are implicated in the pathogenesis of chronic and acute leukemia, and represent attractive targets for therapy. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is a small molecule GENEIN inhibitor that is used for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, and has been shown to have activity against GENEIN from the GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) families. We investigated the efficacy of CHEMICALIN at inhibiting mutants of the GENEIN GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, which are implicated in the pathogenesis of myeloid malignancies. DESIGN AND METHODS: We tested the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on the proliferation of hematopoietic cells transformed by GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN with an internal tandem duplication or GENENOTIN point mutation, and the GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) mutant. The direct effect of CHEMICALIN on the activity of these GENEIN and their downstream signaling was tested using CHEMICALNOTIN-specific antibodies. RESULTS: We show that CHEMICALIN is a potent inhibitor of GENEIN-GENEIN and GENEIN mutants, including some of the mutants that confer resistance to PKC412 and other GENEIN inhibitors. CHEMICALIN induced a cell cycle block and apoptosis in the acute myeloid leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and MOLM-13, both expressing GENEIN with an internal tandem duplication, whereas no effect was observed on four other acute myeloid leukemia cell lines. The CHEMICALIN-resistant GENEIN(GENEIN) mutant, associated with systemic mastocytosis, was found to be resistant to CHEMICALIN. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These results warrant further clinical studies of CHEMICALIN for the treatment of myeloid malignancies expressing activated forms of GENEIN and GENEIN.
17251323	Glucocorticoids stimulate GENENOTIN upregulation in bovine mammary epithelium. Mammary epithelia produce an isotonic, low-CHEMICALNOTIN fluid that is rich in nutrients. Mechanisms that account for the low electrolyte concentration have not been elucidated, although CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive ion transport has been reported in some situations. We hypothesized that corticosteroid exposure modulates GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression and/or activity in bovine mammary epithelial cells. BME-UV cells were grown to confluent monolayers on permeable supports with a standard basolateral medium and apical medium of low-electrolyte, high-CHEMICALNOTIN composition that resembles the ionic composition of milk. Ion transport was assessed in modified Ussing flux chambers. Exposure to glucocorticoids (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN), but not CHEMICALNOTIN, increased short-circuit current (I(sc)), a sensitive measure of net ion transport, whereas apical exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN reduced corticosteroid-induced I(sc) close to basal levels. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated a glucocorticoid-induced increase in mRNA for GENENOTIN, whereas GENENOTIN mRNA expression was only mildly affected. Exposure to CHEMICALIN (a GENEIN antagonist), but not CHEMICALIN (a GENEIN antagonist), precluded both the corticosteroid-induced elevation in CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive I(sc) and the induced changes in GENENOTIN mRNA. We conclude that CHEMICALIN movement across mammary epithelia is modulated by corticosteroids via a GENEIN-mediated mechanism that regulates the expression of the GENENOTIN. GENEIN expression and activity could account for the low CHEMICALIN concentration that is typical of milk.
17259377	CHEMICALNOTIN-based anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit the early lesion of diabetic retinopathy. It has been previously reported that CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the development of diabetic retinopathy in diabetic animals, raising the possibility that anti-inflammatory drugs may have beneficial effects on diabetic retinopathy. To further explore this, we compared effects of oral consumption of three different CHEMICALNOTIN-based drugs (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN) on the development of early stages of diabetic retinopathy in rats. These three drugs differ in their ability to inhibit GENENOTIN but share an ability to inhibit GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Diabetes of 9-10 months duration significantly increased the number of TUNEL (transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling)-positive capillary cells and acellular (degenerate) capillaries in the retinal vasculature, and all three CHEMICALNOTIN-based drugs inhibited this cell death and formation of acellular capillaries without altering the severity of hyperglycemia. In short-term diabetes (2-4 months), all three CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the diabetes-induced loss of neuronal cells from the ganglion cell layer. Oral CHEMICALIN (as a representative of the CHEMICALIN family) inhibited diabetes-induced increase in GENEIN DNA-binding affinity in electrophoretic mobility shift assay and transcription factor array in nuclear extract isolated from whole retina. All three CHEMICALIN inhibited the diabetes-induced translocation of GENEIN (a subunit of GENEIN) into nuclei of retinal vascular endothelial cells of the isolated retinal vasculature, as well as of GENEIN and GENEIN into nuclei of cells in the ganglion cell layer and inner nuclear layer on whole-retinal sections. CHEMICALIN (also as a representative of the CHEMICALIN) inhibited the diabetes-induced upregulation of several inflammatory gene products, which are regulated by GENEIN, including vascular cell adhesion molecule, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN in whole-retinal lysate. CHEMICALIN, in doses administrated in our experiments, inhibited GENEINB and perhaps other transcription factors in the retina, were well tolerated, and offered new tools to investigate and inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy.
1727721	Localization of an GENENOTIN activity to the distal nephron. Evidence for the existence of two species of GENENOTIN in the rat kidney. An GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity has been localized in the rat kidney by a histochemical technique which links CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism with the production of a color reaction. Oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN was observed in cortical distal convoluted tubules and in medullary collecting ducts. CHEMICALNOTIN abolished staining, no reaction was obtained with CHEMICALNOTIN hydroxylated at the 17 or 19 position, and oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN was CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) dependent. These results demonstrate the presence of a GENENOTIN activity separate from the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-dependent GENEIN recently purified and cloned from rat liver. We have named this activity GENENOTIN to distinguish it from the CHEMICALIN-dependent GENEIN. Histological studies showed that GENENOTIN activity does not correlate with the immunocytochemical localization of the previously defined GENENOTIN enzyme, but rather the GENENOTIN activity is localized in the distal tubules of the rat kidney. In this respect GENENOTIN colocalizes with the GENENOTIN. No reaction product was obtained using CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN as substrate with either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN as cofactor. Furthermore incubation of tissue sections with CHEMICALNOTIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN completely inhibited cytochemical staining. We interpret these results as evidence of GENENOTIN activity which uses the reduced cofactor at the expense of the color reaction. These results support the crucial role played by an GENENOTIN in the local protection of type I receptors in mineralocorticoid selective tissues.
17289086	Effect of long-term CHEMICALNOTIN treatment on the GENENOTIN in Caco-2 cells. CHEMICALNOTIN is a selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) broadly used in the treatment of human mood disorders and gastrointestinal diseases involving the serotoninergic system. The effectiveness of this therapy depends on repeated long-term treatment. Most of the long-term studies in vivo of SSRI effects on serotoninergic activity have focused on their effects on autoreceptors or postsynaptic receptors. The chronic effect of SSRIs on the activity of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has been less studied and the results have been contradictory. The aim of this study was to determine the specific effect of long-term CHEMICALNOTIN treatment on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in vitro, by using the human enterocyte-like cell line Caco-2. Results show that CHEMICALNOTIN diminished the CHEMICALNOTIN uptake in a concentration-dependent way and that this effect was reversible. CHEMICALIN affected mainly the GENEIN transport rate by reducing the availability of the transporter in the membrane with no significant alteration of either the total GENEIN protein content or the GENEIN mRNA level. These results suggest that the effect of CHEMICALIN on the expression of GENEIN is post-translational and has shown itself to be independent of GENEIN and GENEIN activity. This study may be useful to clarify the effect of the long-term CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in both gastrointestinal and central nervous system disorders.
17289088	Roles played by GENENOTIN in the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity. Lymphocytes possess the essential components of a cholinergic system, including CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN); GENEIN (GENEIN), its synthesizing enzyme; and both GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively). Stimulation of lymphocytes with GENENOTIN, which activates T cells via the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN complex, enhances the synthesis and release of CHEMICALNOTIN and up-regulates expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNAs. In addition, activation of GENENOTIN and increases in intracellular CHEMICALIN also enhance cholinergic activity in T cells, and GENEIN (GENEIN; GENEIN/GENEIN) is an important mediator of leukocyte migration and T cell activation. Anti-GENENOTIN monoclonal antibody (mAb) as well as antithymocyte GENENOTIN containing antibodies against GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN all increase GENENOTIN activity, CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis and release, and expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNAs in T cells. The CHEMICALNOTIN-lowering drug simvastatin inhibits GENENOTIN signaling by binding to an allosteric site on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN chain), which leads to immunomodulation. We found that CHEMICALIN abolishes anti-GENEIN mAb-induced increases in lymphocytic cholinergic activity in a manner independent of its CHEMICALNOTIN-lowering activity. Collectively then, these results indicate that GENEIN contributes to the regulation of lymphocytic cholinergic activity via GENEIN-mediated pathways and suggest that CHEMICALIN exerts its immunosuppressive effects in part via modification of lymphocytic cholinergic activity.
17341305	Association of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN A expression with hormonal mammary carcinogenesis: role of the host microenvironment. INTRODUCTION: CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) induces GENEIN (GENEIN)-positive and GENEIN (GENEIN)-positive ductal invasive mammary carcinomas in BALB/c mice. We sought to reproduce this CHEMICALNOTIN cancer model in C57BL/6 mice because of their widespread use in genetic engineering. Within this experimental setting, we studied the carcinogenic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, the morphologic changes in mammary glands that are induced by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and the levels of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated and CHEMICALNOTIN-treated mammary glands. Finally, we evaluated whether the differences found between BALB/c and C57BL/6 mouse strains were due to intrinsic differences in epithelial cells. METHODS: The carcinogenic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was evaluated in C57BL/6 mice using protocols proven to be carcinogenic in BALB/c mice. In addition, BALB/c and C57BL/6 females were treated with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN for 1 or 2 months, and mammary glands were excised for histologic studies and for immunohistochemical and Western blot evaluation of GENEIN and GENEIN. Hormone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Isolated mammary epithelial cells were transplanted into cleared fat pads of 21-day-old female Swiss nu/nu mice or control congenic animals. RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN failed to induce mammary carcinomas or significant morphologic changes in the mammary glands of C57BL/6 mice. The expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in virgin mice was surprisingly much higher in BALB/c than in C57BL/6 mammary glands, and both receptors were downregulated in CHEMICALIN-treated BALB/c mice (P < 0.05). GENEIN levels were low in virgin control mice and increased after CHEMICALIN treatment in both strains. GENENOTIN expression followed a similar trend. No differences in hormone levels were found between strains. Surprisingly, the transplantation of the epithelial mammary gland cells of both strains into the cleared fat pads of Swiss (nu/nu) mice abolished the mammary gland morphologic differences and the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN differences between strains. CONCLUSION: C57BL/6 mammary glands are resistant to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced carcinogenesis and to hormone action. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN have different effects on mammary glands. Low GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels in untreated mammary glands may be associated with a low-risk breast cancer profile. Although we cannot at this time rule out the participation of other, untested factors, our findings implicate the stroma as playing a crucial role in the strain-specific differential GENENOTIN expression and hormone responsiveness.
17350061	Transplacental exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN at a hepatocarcinogenic dose induces fetal gene expression changes in mice indicative of aberrant CHEMICALNOTIN signaling and disrupted CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. Exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN in utero in C3H mice produces hepatocellular carcinoma in male offspring when they reach adulthood. To help define the molecular events associated with the fetal onset of CHEMICALNOTIN hepatocarcinogenesis, pregnant C3H mice were given drinking water containing 0 (control) or 85 ppm CHEMICALNOTIN from day 8 to 18 of gestation. At the end of the CHEMICALNOTIN exposure period, male fetal livers were removed and RNA isolated for microarray analysis using 22K oligo chips. CHEMICALNOTIN exposure in utero produced significant (p<0.001) alterations in expression of 187 genes, with approximately 25% of aberrantly expressed genes related to either CHEMICALNOTIN signaling or CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. Real-time RT-PCR on selected genes confirmed these changes. Various genes controlled by CHEMICALIN, including GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, were dramatically over-expressed. CHEMICALIN-regulated genes including GENEIN and GENEIN were over-expressed, although GENEIN was suppressed. Several genes involved with CHEMICALIN metabolism also showed remarkable expression changes, including increased expression of GENEIN (GENEIN; involved in CHEMICALIN production) and decreased expression of GENEIN (involved in CHEMICALIN production). The expression of key genes important in CHEMICALIN metabolism, such as GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN, were suppressed. Thus, exposure of mouse fetus to CHEMICALNOTIN during a critical period in development significantly alters the expression of various genes encoding CHEMICALNOTIN signaling and CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. These alterations could disrupt genetic programming at the very early life stage, which could impact tumor formation much later in adulthood.
17352828	A pilot study of GENENOTIN inhibition by anakinra in acute gout. CHEMICALIN crystals stimulate monocytes and macrophages to release GENEIN through the GENEIN component of the inflammasome. The effectiveness of GENENOTIN inhibition in hereditary autoinflammatory syndromes with mutations in the GENENOTIN protein suggested that GENENOTIN inhibition might also be effective in relieving the inflammatory manifestations of acute gout. The effectiveness of GENENOTIN inhibition was first evaluated in a mouse model of CHEMICALNOTIN crystal-induced inflammation. GENENOTIN inhibition prevented peritoneal neutrophil accumulation but GENENOTIN blockade had no effect. Based on these findings, we performed a pilot, open-labeled study (trial registration number ISRCTN10862635) in 10 patients with gout who could not tolerate or had failed standard antiinflammatory therapies. All patients received 100 mg anakinra daily for 3 days. All 10 patients with acute gout responded rapidly to anakinra. No adverse effects were observed. GENENOTIN blockade appears to be an effective therapy for acute gouty arthritis. The clinical findings need to be confirmed in a controlled study.
17355872	Structural basis of inhibition of the GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. Sirtuins are CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent protein deacetylases and are emerging as molecular targets for the development of pharmaceuticals to treat human metabolic and neurological diseases and cancer. To date, several GENENOTIN inhibitors and activators have been identified, but the structural mechanisms of how these compounds modulate GENENOTIN activity have not yet been determined. We identified CHEMICALIN as a compound that binds to GENEIN and showed that it inhibits GENEIN activity with an IC(50) value of 22 microM. To provide insights into how sirtuin function is altered by inhibitors, we determined two crystal structures of GENEIN, one in complex with CHEMICALIN-ribose, the other bound to CHEMICALIN. Our structural studies provide a view of a synthetic inhibitory compound in a GENEIN active site revealing that CHEMICALIN binds into the CHEMICALIN, the product, and the substrate-binding site. Finally, our structures may enable the rational design of more potent inhibitors.
17369066	Metabolic derangement of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism in mice deficient in GENENOTIN. Hyperhomocyst(e)inemia is a metabolic derangement that is linked to the distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN pools, which provide one-CHEMICALNOTIN units for biosynthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and for remethylation of CHEMICALNOTIN to form CHEMICALNOTIN. In humans, GENEIN deficiency results in the accumulation of CHEMICALIN at the expense of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives required for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis. Complete ablation of GENENOTIN activity in mice results in embryonic lethality. Other mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia have normal or reduced levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and are not embryonic lethal, although they have decreased ratios of CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN and impaired methylation. We have constructed a mouse model with a gene trap insertion in the GENENOTIN gene specifying GENENOTIN, an enzyme essential for the activity of GENENOTIN. This model is a hypomorph, with reduced GENENOTIN activity, thus avoiding the lethality associated with the absence of GENENOTIN activity. GENENOTIN(gt/gt) mice have increased plasma CHEMICALNOTIN, decreased plasma CHEMICALNOTIN, and increased tissue CHEMICALNOTIN. Unexpectedly, GENENOTIN(gt/gt) mice do not show decreases in the CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN ratio in most tissues. The different metabolite profiles in the various genetic mouse models for hyperhomocyst(e)inemia may be useful in understanding biological effects of elevated CHEMICALNOTIN.
17369473	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN activate GENEIN in the heart by increasing cytosolic CHEMICALNOTIN concentration. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) acts as a cellular energy sensor: it responds to an increase in CHEMICALNOTIN concentration ([CHEMICALNOTIN]) or the CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratio (CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, which are CHEMICALIN, have been reported to increase GENEIN activity without increasing CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN. This study tests the hypothesis that these CHEMICALNOTIN increase GENENOTIN activity in the heart by increasing cytosolic [CHEMICALNOTIN]. Groups of isolated rat hearts (n = 5-7 each) were perfused with Krebs-Henseleit buffer with or without 0.2 mM CHEMICALNOTIN or 10 mM CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN-NMR-measured CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and intracellular pH were used to calculate cytosolic [CHEMICALNOTIN]. At various times, hearts were freeze-clamped and assayed for GENENOTIN activity, phosphorylation of Thr(172) on GENENOTIN, and phosphorylation of Ser(79) on GENENOTIN, an GENENOTIN target. In hearts treated with CHEMICALIN for 18 min and then perfused for 20 min with Krebs-Henseleit buffer, [CHEMICALNOTIN] began to increase at 26 min and GENEIN activity was elevated at 36 min. In hearts treated with CHEMICALIN, [CHEMICALNOTIN] was increased at 50 min and GENEIN activity, phosphorylated GENEIN, and GENEIN were elevated at 61 min. In CHEMICALNOTIN-treated hearts, HPLC-measured total CHEMICALNOTIN content and total CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN did not increase. In summary, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN increase GENEIN activity and phosphorylation in the isolated heart. The increase in GENENOTIN activity was always preceded by and correlated with increased cytosolic [CHEMICALNOTIN]. Total CHEMICALNOTIN content and total CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN did not change. Cytosolic [CHEMICALNOTIN] reported metabolically active CHEMICALIN, which triggered increased GENEIN activity, but measures of total CHEMICALNOTIN did not.
17381051	The role of glutathione transferases M1 and T1 in individual susceptibility to bladder cancer in a Tunisian population. BACKGROUND: Susceptibility to bladder cancer is thought to depend on interplay between genetic factors and environmental chemical carcinogens. AIM: This study seeks to determine the role of the glutathione transferases M1 and T1 null genotypes (GSTM1*0 and GSTT1*0) in individual susceptibility to bladder cancer in a Tunisian population. METHOD: Sixty-two patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder cancer and 79 controls were examined with respect to the frequency of GSTM1 and GSTT1 null genotypes. RESULTS: The frequencies of the GSTT1 null in the total group of bladder cancer cases vs. controls did not differ statistically. The proportion of GSTM1 null genotype in patients was 63% compared to 45% in controls group (OR = 2.03; 95% CI 0.97-4.24; p = 0.04). A significantly higher incidence of GSTM1 deletion genotype was found in smokers with bladder cancer compared to the controls (65.38% vs. 45.5%). Smokers lacking the GSTM1 gene are at an approximately 2.2-fold higher risk of bladder cancer (OR= 2.23, 95% CI 1-5.15; p = 0.03). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that in Tunisian subjects the GSTM1 null genotype may be associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. This association appears to depend upon smoking status.
1738111	Characterization of GENEIN receptors in rat spinal cord via CHEMICALIN binding and inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN release. The aim of the present study in rat spinal cord synaptosomes was to compare the pharmacological characteristics of the GENENOTIN defined by CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN binding and the GENENOTIN defined by inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN release. In Percoll gradient Fractions 3 and 4 of spinal cord synaptosomes, a single saturable binding site for CHEMICALNOTIN with a maximum binding of 70 and 134 fmol/mg, respectively, was demonstrated in the presence of 30 microM CHEMICALNOTIN. The Kd of 0.16 nM did not vary between fractions. Competition for CHEMICALNOTIN binding by various CHEMICALNOTIN agonists and antagonists also indicated a single site model based on a Hill coefficient of approximately 1.0. The most potent compounds at displacing CHEMICALNOTIN binding were CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN binding was not altered by compounds with activity at GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN or alpha-2 receptor sites. Similar to the pharmacological characteristics of the GENENOTIN site defined by CHEMICALNOTIN, compounds most active at inhibiting 15 mM CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated release of CHEMICALNOTIN were CHEMICALNOTIN = CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN = CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN. Compounds with activity at GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN sites were inactive. A correlation analysis of selective GENENOTIN compounds comparing the pKD for displacement of CHEMICALNOTIN vs. the IC50 for inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN release demonstrated the pharmacological similarity of the presynaptic inhibitory GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN site defined by CHEMICALNOTIN binding in spinal cord synaptosomes (r = 0.791, P = .0193). Although CHEMICALNOTIN binding was unaltered, alpha-2 agonists such as CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN) as well as the alpha-2 antagonists CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN also decreased the CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated release of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, an alpha-2 antagonist increased release. The action of these alpha-2 compounds to alter CHEMICALNOTIN release suggests the presence of heteroreceptors localized on CHEMICALNOTIN terminals in the spinal cord. These results point out that CHEMICALNOTIN identifies the GENENOTIN receptor, and affinity of compounds for this site predicts action at the GENENOTIN autoreceptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
17382376	GENEIN involvement in prepulse inhibition and memory function: relevance for the antipsychotic actions of CHEMICALIN. GENEIN blockade is one of the more prominent actions of the multi-receptor acting antipsychotic CHEMICALIN. It is currently not known how much this GENEIN antagonism of CHEMICALIN contributes to the therapeutic or adverse side effects of CHEMICALIN. The current studies with Sprague-Dawley rats were conducted to determine the participation of GENENOTIN subtype in sensorimotor plasticity and memory function affected by CHEMICALNOTIN using tests of prepulse inhibition (PPI) and radial-arm maze choice accuracy. The PPI impairment caused by the CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) was significantly attenuated by CHEMICALNOTIN. In the current project, we found that the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN also reversed the CHEMICALIN-induced impairment in PPI of tactile startle with an auditory prepulse. In the radial-arm maze (RAM), CHEMICALNOTIN, like CHEMICALNOTIN, impaired working memory and caused a significant dose-related slowing of response. CHEMICALNOTIN, however, decreased the number of reference memory errors. We have previously shown that CHEMICALNOTIN effectively attenuates the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced working memory impairment, but in the current study, CHEMICALNOTIN did not significantly alter the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the RAM. In summary, the therapeutic effect of CHEMICALIN in reversing PPI impairment was mimicked by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, while CHEMICALIN had a mixed effect on cognition. CHEMICALNOTIN impaired working memory but improved reference memory in rats. Thus, GENEIN antagonism seems to play a role in part of the beneficial actions of antipsychotics, such as CHEMICALIN.
17387686	Inhibition of phosphatidylserine biosynthesis in developing rat brain by maternal exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN. Phosphatidylserine (PtdSer), major acidic phospholipids in neuronal membranes, participate in important cell signaling processes. The PtdSer in brain is highly enriched with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; 22:6n-3), and the CHEMICALNOTIN status or CHEMICALNOTIN exposure has been shown to influence the PtdSer level. This study shows that CHEMICALNOTIN exposure during prenatal and developmental period significantly attenuates microsomal PtdSer biosynthetic activities and reduces PtdSer, particularly 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer, in developing rat brain cortices. Brain microsomes were incubated with CHEMICALNOTIN labeled exogenous substrates in vitro and the products formed were detected by reversed phase HPLC-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). These in vitro bioassays showed that CHEMICALNOTIN (18:0, 22:6) species is the best substrate for PtdSer synthesis from both CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). The PtdSer biosynthetic activity of brain, especially for 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer production, was hampered significantly by maternal exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN. PtdSer levels were consistently reduced significantly in brain cortices of the pups from CHEMICALNOTIN-exposed dams, due mainly to the depletion of 18:0, 22:6-PtdSer. The mRNA expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) was not reduced by CHEMICALIN. Similarly, the GENEIN enzyme level did not change after CHEMICALIN exposure but GENENOTIN could not be probed with the antibody available currently. Degradation of PtdSer by mitochondrial PtdSer decarboxylation was not enhanced but also inhibited. Taken together, attenuated PtdSer biosynthetic activities are largely responsible for the PtdSer reduction observed in developing rat brains after maternal exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN.
17403374	Regulation of gluconeogenesis by GENENOTIN. In the postabsorptive state, certain tissues, including the brain, require CHEMICALNOTIN as the sole source of energy. After an overnight fast, hepatic glycogen stores are depleted, and gluconeogenesis becomes essential for preventing life-threatening hypoglycemia. Mice with a targeted deletion of GENENOTIN, a member of the GENENOTIN family of transcription factors, display severe hypoglycemia after an overnight (18 hr) fast. We provide evidence that defective CHEMICALNOTIN catabolism promotes the development of fasting hypoglycemia in GENENOTIN-/- mice by limiting gluconeogenic substrate availability. GENENOTIN-/- liver and skeletal muscle show markedly reduced mRNA expression of CHEMICALNOTIN-degrading enzymes. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of GENEIN (GENEIN), which converts the critical gluconeogenic CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN into CHEMICALIN, is decreased (approximately 50%) in GENENOTIN-/- hepatocytes. Consistent with this observation, intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, rescues fasting hypoglycemia in GENENOTIN-/- mice. We conclude that GENENOTIN plays an important role in the regulation of gluconeogenesis.
17427197	CHEMICALIN stimulation of CHEMICALNOTIN transport and CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis results from activation of GENENOTIN and GENEIN requiring functional GENEIN in human umbilical vein endothelium. Elevated extracellular CHEMICALIN increases GENEIN (GENEIN) release from human umbilical vein endothelium (HUVEC). GENENOTIN, via GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN, activates GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN)). We studied whether CHEMICALIN-stimulation of CHEMICALNOTIN transport and CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis involves GENEIN in primary cultures of HUVEC. GENEIN release was higher ( approximately 1.6-fold) in 25 mM (high) compared with 5 mM (normal) CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN increases CHEMICALNOTIN transport (half maximal effect approximately 1.6 ng/ml) in normal CHEMICALNOTIN, but did not alter high CHEMICALNOTIN-increased CHEMICALNOTIN transport. GENENOTIN and high CHEMICALIN increased GENEIN mRNA expression ( approximately 8-fold) and maximal transport velocity (V(max)), CHEMICALIN formation from CHEMICALIN (index of CHEMICALIN synthesis) and GENEIN (GENEIN) protein abundance, but did not alter GENEIN phosphorylation. GENENOTIN and high CHEMICALIN increased GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) and GENEIN phosphorylation, an effect blocked by CHEMICALIN (GENENOTIN inhibitor). However, GENENOTIN and high CHEMICALNOTIN were ineffective in cells expressing a truncated, negative dominant GENENOTIN. High CHEMICALIN increases CHEMICALNOTIN transport and GENEIN expression following GENEIN activation by GENEIN involving GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) and GENEIN in HUVEC. Thus, GENENOTIN could play a crucial role under conditions of hyperglycemia, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, which is associated with fetal endothelial dysfunction.
17459764	CHEMICALIN induce the expression of GENEIN via GENEIN activation in human keratinocyte HaCaT cells. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibit inflammation, in vivo and in vitro in keratinocytes. We examined in HaCaT keratinocyte cell line whether CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) a CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) a CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN a CHEMICALNOTIN, modulate expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), an enzyme pivotal to skin inflammation and reparation. We demonstrate that only treatment of HaCaT with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN or a GENEIN ligand (CHEMICALIN), induced GENEIN expression (protein and mRNA). Moreover stimulation of GENEIN activity was increased by those CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. The inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (GENEIN antagonists), on GENEIN expression and on stimulation of GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN suggest that GENENOTIN is implicated in GENENOTIN induction. Finally, GENEIN inhibitor methyl CHEMICALIN blocked the CHEMICALIN effects on GENEIN induction, promoter activity and CHEMICALNOTIN mobilization suggesting involvement of CHEMICALIN metabolites in GENEIN activation. These findings demonstrate that CHEMICALIN increased GENEIN activity is necessary for the GENEIN induction in HaCaT human keratinocyte cells. Given the anti-inflammatory properties of CHEMICALNOTIN, we suggest that induction of GENEIN in keratinocytes may be important in the anti-inflammatory and protective mechanism of action of CHEMICALIN or n-6.
17465221	Methylation-mediated silencing of genes is not altered by selenium treatment of prostate cancer cells. BACKGROUND: The role of selenium in reducing the risk of multiple cancers has been described in the literature. Although reports have described the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic function of selenium by up-regulation of genes in these pathways, information is lacking on the target mechanisms of selenium on specific genes. This study examines whether selenium treatment alters the methylation status of epigenetically silenced genes in prostate cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylation of glutathione sulfotransferase pi (GSTP1) and Ras associated family 1A (RASSF1A) genes was studied using methylation sensitive PCR (MS-PCR). Gene expression was studied using Reverse Transcriptase PCR and Western Blotting. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Treatment of prostate cancer cells with selenium did not alter the expression of genes that were silenced by DNA methylation. Furthermore, the methylation status of these genes remained unaltered after treatment with seleno-DL-methionine.
17472819	Nebulized CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with COPD: a 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and tolerability of nebulized CHEMICALIN (a selective, long-acting GENEIN agonist that is the CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN versus placebo in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). METHODS: This 12-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo- and active-controlled trial was conducted at 60 centers across the United States. Male and female patients aged >or=35 years with physician-diagnosed COPD received CHEMICALNOTIN (15 microg BID, 25 microg BID, or 50 microg QD via nebulizer), CHEMICALNOTIN (42 microg BID via metered dose inhaler), or placebo. Pulmonary function was assessed by spirometry; dyspnea, by the Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI); and health status, by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Adverse events (AEs) were assessed by site personnel at all clinic visits (screening, first dose at week 0, and at weeks 3, 6, 9, 12, and follow-up). COPD exacerbations were defined as worsening respiratory status requiring a change in medication or an unscheduled provider visit. RESULTS: A total of 717 patients received study medication. The demographic composition of all treatment arms was similar. The mean age was 62.9 years, 58% were men, and mean baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV(1)) was 1.2 L (41% predicted). Mean improvement in trough FEV(1) over 12 weeks was significantly greater with all 3 CHEMICALNOTIN doses (15 microg BID, +16.9%; 25 microg BID, +18.9%; 50 microg QD, +14.9%) and for CHEMICALNOTIN (+17.4%) relative to placebo (+6.0%; P < 0.001). There were significantly greater improvements in the mean percentage change in FEV(1) AUC(0-12h) from the predose value over 12 weeks (15 microg BID, 12.7%, 25 microg BID, 13.9%, 50 microg QD, 18.9%; CHEMICALNOTIN, 9.8%) versus placebo (2.7%; P <or= 0.001); all doses of arformoterol were statistically different from salmeterol for this end point (P <or= 0.024). At week 12, TDI focal scores were significantly greater with all arformoterol doses compared with placebo (mean [95% CI]: 15 microg BID, 0.97 [0.25-1.69]; 25 microg BID, 1.08 [0.3-1.86]; 50 microg QD, 1.04 [0.32-1.771), suggesting treatment-associated improvement in dyspnea, however, the difference between salmeterol and placebo was not statistically significant (0.36 [-0.40 to 1.12]). Improvements in health status, as measured using SGRQ total scores, were -2.6 to -3.6 U in the arformoterol groups, -4.4 U for salmeterol, and -1.2 U for placebo; 95% CI of differences versus placebo suggested significant improvement for the arformoterol 25 microg BID and salmeterol groups. There was a similar frequency of AEs and COPD exacerbations across all groups, including placebo. CONCLUSIONS: In this trial, patients with moderate to severe COPD administered nebulized arformoterol over 12 weeks were observed to have significant and sustained improvements in airway function and dyspnea compared with placebo. The results also suggest that all doses of arformoterol, including the lowest dose (15 microg BID), were effective. Overall, nebulized arformoterol was well tolerated.
17477831	Discovery of GENENOTIN inhibitors: comparison of a fluorescence intensity-based CHEMICALNOTIN assay and a fluorescence polarization-based CHEMICALNOTIN Assay for high-throughput screening. GENEIN (GENEIN) enzymes exist as two isoforms, GENEIN and GENEIN, which play critical roles in CHEMICALIN biosynthesis and oxidation. Though each isoform differs in tissue and subcellular localization, both catalyze the CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent carboxylation of CHEMICALNOTIN to generate CHEMICALNOTIN, a key metabolite in the control of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis and oxidation. The cytosolic GENEIN is expressed primarily in liver and adipose tissue, and uses CHEMICALIN as a key building block in CHEMICALIN biosynthesis. The mitochondrial GENEIN is primarily expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, where it is involved in the regulation of CHEMICALIN oxidation. Inhibitors of GENENOTIN enzymes may therefore be useful therapeutics for diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Two assay formats for these CHEMICALNOTIN-utilizing enzymes amenable to high-throughput screening are compared: a fluorescence intensity-based assay to detect CHEMICALNOTIN and a fluorescence polarization-based assay to detect CHEMICALNOTIN. GENENOTIN inhibitors were identified by these high-throughput screening methods and were confirmed in a radiometric high performance liquid chromatography assay of CHEMICALNOTIN production.
17486539	CHEMICALNOTIN is required for specification of the ventral eye field and for Rathke's pouch in the avian embryo. We have investigated the role of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in eye development using the CHEMICALNOTIN deficient quail model system, which overcomes problems of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesising enzyme redundancy in the embryo. In the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN, the ventral optic stalk and ventral retina are missing, whereas the dorsal optic stalk and dorsal retina develop appropriately. Other ocular abnormalities observed were a thinner retina and the lack of differentiation of the lens. In an attempt to explain this, we studied the expression of various dorsally and ventrally expressed genes such as GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and noted that they were unchanged in their expression patterns. In contrast, the CHEMICALIN catabolising enzymes GENEIN and GENEIN which are known to be CHEMICALNOTIN-responsive were not expressed at all in the developing eye. At much earlier stages, the expression domain of GENENOTIN in the prechordal plate was reduced, as was GENENOTIN and we suggest a model whereby the eye field is specified according to the concentration of GENENOTIN protein that is present. We also describe another organ, Rathke's pouch which fails to develop in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN. We attribute this to the down-regulation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN which are known to be involved in the induction of this structure.
17494858	Distinct patterns of mutations occurring in de novo AML versus AML arising in the setting of severe congenital neutropenia. Severe congenital neutropenia (SCN) is an inborn disorder of granulopoiesis. Like most other bone marrow failure syndromes, it is associated with a marked propensity to transform into a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute leukemia, with a cumulative rate of transformation to MDS/leukemia that exceeds 20%. The genetic (and/or epigenetic) changes that contribute to malignant transformation in SCN are largely unknown. In this study, we performed mutational profiling of 14 genes previously implicated in leukemogenesis using 14 MDS/leukemia samples from patients with SCN. We used high-throughput exon-based resequencing of whole-genome-amplified genomic DNA with a semiautomated method to detect mutations. The sensitivity and specificity of the sequencing pipeline was validated by determining the frequency of mutations in these 14 genes using 188 de novo AML samples. As expected, mutations of tyrosine kinase genes (FLT3, KIT, and JAK2) were common in de novo AML, with a cumulative frequency of 30%. In contrast, no mutations in these genes were detected in the SCN samples; instead, mutations of CSF3R, encoding the G-CSF receptor, were common. These data support the hypothesis that mutations of CSF3R may provide the "activated tyrosine kinase signal" that is thought to be important for leukemogenesis.
17498508	Biology of GENENOTIN: GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the synthesis, secretion, biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the GENENOTIN peptides GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The published literature was reviewed, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are both secreted within minutes of nutrient ingestion and facilitate the rapid disposal of ingested nutrients. Both peptides share common actions on islet beta-cells acting through structurally distinct yet related receptors. GENENOTIN activation leads to CHEMICALIN-dependent GENEIN secretion, induction of beta-cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. GENENOTIN also promotes energy storage via direct actions on adipose tissue, and enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, GENEIN exerts glucoregulatory actions via slowing of gastric emptying and CHEMICALIN-dependent inhibition of GENEIN secretion. GENENOTIN also promotes satiety and sustained GENENOTIN activation is associated with weight loss in both preclinical and clinical studies. The rapid degradation of both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN by the enzyme GENENOTIN has led to the development of degradation-resistant GENENOTIN agonists and GENENOTIN inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents decrease GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 diabetes. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN integrate nutrient-derived signals to control food intake, energy absorption, and assimilation. Recently approved therapeutic agents based on potentiation of GENENOTIN action provide new physiologically based approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
17500228	[Characteristics of A-interferon-generated dendritic cells in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis]. The phenotype of the dendritic cells (DC) generated from the adhesion fraction of mononuclear cells in the presence of GM-CSF and alpha-interferon was studied in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Despite the absence of significant differences in the count of mature CD83+DCs in the groups of patients (n = 38) and healthy donors (n = 30), elevated CD14(+)-monocyte levels and few activated CD25(+)-DCs were indicative of the impaired process of DC maturation/generation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in a subgroup of patients with a low T-cell proliferative response against PPD (PPD-anergy, n = 10). The patients with tuberculosis showed the lower relative levels of CD11c(-)-CD123(+)-DC and the normal levels of myeloid CD11c(+)D123(-)DCs. However, in patients with PPD-anergy, the content of myeloid CD11c(+)CD123(-)-DCs was significantly higher than that in PPD-reactive patients. Moreover, the patients with PPD-anergy were characterized by the elevated peripheral blood levels of CD14+CD16(+)-monocytes, which was associated with the high suppressive activity of monocytes (r(s) = 0.53; p < 0.05). The impaired process of DC generation/maturation in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis is believed to be associated with the changes in the phenotypic and functional properties of monocytes and to be a cause of an inadequate antigen-specific response in tuberculous infection.
17501690	Aripiprazole acts as a selective GENENOTIN partial agonist. CHEMICALNOTIN has made a significant contribution to the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders with an improved safety and tolerability profile, which has been attributed to its unique pharmacological profile. It has been claimed that partial agonism of the GENENOTIN and antagonism of the GENEIN receptor contribute to the clinical profile of CHEMICALIN, a so-called CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN stabiliser. However, recent studies have questioned the role of the CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated systems in the mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN. This report reviews published and unpublished data that suggest that CHEMICALIN acts as a selective partial agonist at the GENEIN and does not affect GENEIN at therapeutic doses.
17504182	Pharmacological therapy of Cushing's syndrome: drugs and indications. OBJECTIVE: To review the main pharmacological properties and clinical applications of the drugs used in the medical therapy of Cushing's syndrome. DATA SOURCES: Search for articles were performed in the following dababases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of systematic Reviews and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Search terms included Cushing's syndrome and drug therapy. DATA SYNTHESIS: Available data suggest that neuromodulatory compounds affect GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) or GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) synthesis and release. They include CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists, dopaminergic agonists, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN analogs and CHEMICALNOTIN. These agents have been effective in a limited number of patients with GENENOTIN-dependent Cushing's syndrome. Inhibitors of steroidogenesis reduce cortisol production by blocking one (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) or several (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) enzymes involved in steroid biosynthesis. CHEMICALNOTIN is a steroidogenesis inhibitor with adrenolitic properties. CHEMICALIN blocks GENEIN activation without modifying CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis. CONCLUSION: Agents that inhibit steroidogenesis are useful in all forms of Cushing's syndrome and are effective in about 70% of patients. Main indications for drug therapy include preparation for surgery, persistence or recurrence after surgery, while awaiting for the effect of radiation therapy, occult ectopic GENENOTIN syndrome, severe hypercortisolism and malignancy related hypercortisolism.
17507169	GENENOTIN in the paraventricular nucleus and central control of penile erection: immunocytochemistry, autoradiography and behavioral studies. [CHEMICALIN] (CHEMICALIN), a selective GENEIN antagonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) of male rats, induces penile erection. This effect is mediated by the release of CHEMICALNOTIN, which in turn activates central oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. Double immunofluorescence studies with selective antibodies against GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN itself, have shown that GENENOTIN in the PVN are located mainly in GABAergic terminals and fibers surrounding oxytocinergic cell bodies. As GABAergic synapses in the PVN impinge directly on oxytocinergic neurons or on excitatory glutamatergic synapses, which also impinge on oxytocinergic neurons, these results suggest that the blockade of GENENOTIN decreases CHEMICALNOTIN release in the PVN, increasing in turn glutamatergic neurotransmission to activate oxytocinergic neurons mediating penile erection. Autoradiography studies with CHEMICALIN show that chronic treatment with CHEMICALIN for 15 days twice daily (1 mg/kg i.p.) significantly increases the density of GENEIN in the PVN. This increase occurs concomitantly with an almost twofold increase in the pro-erectile effect of CHEMICALNOTIN injected into the PVN as compared with control rats. The present findings confirm that PVN GENENOTIN, localized mainly in GABAergic synapses that control in an inhibitory fashion excitatory synapses, exert an inhibitory control on penile erection, demonstrating for the first time that chronic blockade of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN increases the density of these receptors in the PVN. This increase is related to an enhanced pro-erectile effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, which is still present 3 days after the end of the chronic treatment.
17510465	Activation of human platelets by misfolded proteins. OBJECTIVE: Protein misfolding diseases result from the deposition of insoluble protein aggregates that often contain fibrils called GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN are found in Alzheimer disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus, and systemic amyloidosis, which are diseases where platelet activation might be implicated. METHODS AND RESULTS: We induced GENENOTIN properties in 6 unrelated proteins and found that all induced platelet aggregation in contrast to fresh controls. GENENOTIN-induced platelet aggregation was independent of CHEMICALNOTIN formation and CHEMICALNOTIN secretion but enhanced by feedback stimulation through these pathways. Treatments that raised CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), sequestered CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) or prevented GENENOTIN-platelet interaction (sRAGE, GENENOTIN [GENENOTIN]) induced almost complete inhibition. Modulation of the function of GENENOTIN (CD36-/- mice), GENEIN(GENEIN) (CHEMICALIN), GENEIN (CHEMICALIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, 6D1 antibody) induced approximately 50% inhibition. Interference with GENENOTIN binding (RGDS) revealed a major contribution of GENENOTIN-independent aggregation (agglutination). CONCLUSIONS: Protein misfolding resulting in the appearance of GENENOTIN induces platelet aggregation. GENEIN activates platelets through 2 pathways: one is through GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN), CHEMICALIN-mediated induction of aggregation; the other is through GENENOTIN-mediated aggregation and agglutination. The platelet stimulating properties of amyloid might explain the enhanced platelet activation observed in many diseases accompanied by the appearance of misfolded proteins with amyloid.
17512723	GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN causing Leber's congenital amaurosis, is also involved in steroid metabolism. Three GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were tested for steroid converting abilities: GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is involved in retinal degeneration in Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA). We show that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN do not reveal activity towards the checked steroids, but that GENEIN reduces dihydrotestosterone to CHEMICALIN, and is thus also involved in steroid metabolism. Furthermore, we analyzed both expression and subcellular localization of these enzymes.
17544870	Alteration of gastric functions and candidate genes associated with weight reduction in response to CHEMICALNOTIN. BACKGROUND & AIMS: It is unclear whether weight loss with the noradrenergic (CHEMICALNOTIN) and serotonergic (CHEMICALNOTIN) reuptake inhibitor, CHEMICALNOTIN, is associated with altered stomach functions and whether genetics influence treatment response. METHODS: Forty-eight overweight and obese but otherwise healthy participants were randomized to placebo or CHEMICALNOTIN (15 mg/day for 12 weeks). At baseline and posttreatment we measured the following: gastric emptying for solids and liquids by scintigraphy, gastric volumes by single-photon emission computed tomography, maximum tolerated volume and 30-minute postnutrient challenge symptoms, and selected gastrointestinal hormones. All participants received structured behavior therapy for weight management. The influence of candidate gene polymorphisms involved in CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN or receptor function (CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN-methyltransferase, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN [homo sapiens] [GENENOTIN]) on weight loss and gastric functions was evaluated. RESULTS: The overall average weight loss posttreatment was 5.4 +/- 0.8 (SEM) kg with CHEMICALNOTIN and 0.9 +/- 0.9 kg with placebo (P < .001). The CHEMICALIN group showed significant retardation in gastric emptying of solids (P = .03), reduced maximum tolerated volume (P = .03), and increased postprandial GENEIN compared with the placebo group. Obese females showed greater effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on weight loss and gastric emptying of solids and liquids. Gastric volumes and postchallenge symptoms were not significantly different in the 2 treatment groups. The LS/SS genotype of the promoter for GENEIN was associated with enhanced weight loss with CHEMICALIN. CONCLUSIONS: Weight reduction with CHEMICALIN is associated with altered gastric functions and increased GENEIN and is significantly associated with GENEIN genotype. The role of genetic variation in GENEIN on weight loss in response to CHEMICALIN deserves further study.
17570336	Multiple GENEIN forms are produced by distinct starting points and alternative splicing of the CHEMICALIN-terminal exons. 5'-RACE was performed on GENENOTIN mRNA and two new translation initiation ATG's were found. The first one is upstream of the previously designed initiation translation site localized in the GENENOTIN. The deduced protein sequence of this region is highly homologous to the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN in other species. The other ATG has not previously been reported and is localized in exon 8, thus originating a GENENOTIN isoform constituted only by four repetitive inhibitory units without the GENENOTIN. Transcripts from the GENENOTIN gene are also subjected to multiple splicing events involving exons 4, 6, 8 in different combinations. A series of recombinant GENENOTIN forms was produced that differed in the exons present in the GENENOTIN, and all the variants showed comparable inhibitory efficiency against GENENOTIN. It was concluded that the presence of the GENENOTIN in these isoforms is not relevant for the formation of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN complex in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN, that is the interaction of GENENOTIN with inactive GENENOTIN. Using exon-specific antisera, specific GENENOTIN protein isoforms containing the GENENOTIN have been detected in rat brain homogenates.
17575572	An investigation of the absolute configuration of the potent GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN using vibrational circular dichroism. CHEMICALIN [(+)-1] is one of the most potent members of a class of chiral drug substances used to regulate the synthesis and release of CHEMICALNOTIN by the GENEIN, and as such, is an important biomarker for pharmaceutical companies conducting research in this field. In addition to overall structural features, the bioactivity of this molecule has also been found to be highly dependent on absolute stereochemistry, making the reliable assignment of this property a necessity. X-ray diffraction studies have provided conflicting data, leaving its three-dimensional structure uncertain. In view of this, its absolute configuration was investigated by vibrational circular dichroism. Results from this study provided independent assignment of this important molecule as the (1S,2S)-enantiomer.
17588565	Allosteric interaction of the neuromuscular blockers CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN with recombinant GENEIN. Neuromuscular blocking drugs produce muscle weakness by interaction with GENENOTIN. Cardiovascular side effects have been reported. In this study the neuromuscular blocking drug CHEMICALIN and the controls CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN slowed the rate of CHEMICALIN induced CHEMICALIN dissociation from Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing recombinant GENEIN K(off) values min(-1); CHEMICALNOTIN (125 nM), CHEMICALNOTIN 0.45+/-0.07+blocker 0.04+/-0.02; CHEMICALNOTIN (21 nM), CHEMICALNOTIN 0.42+/-0.05+blocker 0.15+/-0.04; CHEMICALNOTIN(21 nM), CHEMICALNOTIN 0.36+/-0.03+blocker 0.03+/-0.01). These data indicate that CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN interact with an allosteric site on the GENEIN (located on the heart) and this may explain some of their cardiac side effects.
17592724	CHEMICALIN-mediated oxidative stress disrupts CHEMICALIN binding on GENEIN: more evidence for oxidative stress in vitiligo. Patients with acute vitiligo have low epidermal GENEIN expression/activities and accumulate 10(-3) M CHEMICALIN. One consequence of this severe oxidative stress is an altered CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis in epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. Here, we show decreased epidermal GENENOTIN expression in acute vitiligo. Since 10(-3)M CHEMICALNOTIN oxidises CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN residues in proteins, we examined CHEMICALIN binding to GENEIN in the presence and absence of CHEMICALIN utilising (45)CHEMICALNOTIN. The results showed that all four CHEMICALIN atoms exchanged per molecule of GENEIN. Since oxidised GENENOTIN looses its ability to activate GENENOTIN, enzyme activities were followed in full skin biopsies from lesional skin of patients with acute vitiligo (n=6) and healthy controls (n=6). The results yielded a 4-fold decrease of ATPase activities in the patients. Computer simulation of native and oxidised GENENOTIN confirmed the loss of all four CHEMICALNOTIN ions from their specific GENENOTIN. Taken together CHEMICALIN-mediated oxidation affects CHEMICALIN binding in GENEIN leading to perturbed CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis and perturbed CHEMICALNOTIN-uptake in the epidermis of acute vitiligo.
17596133	The genetic interaction between VKORC1 c1173t and calumenin a29809g modulates the anticoagulant response of acenocoumarol. BACKGROUND: The efficacy of oral anticoagulant therapy is largely conditioned by both environmental and genetic factors. OBJECTIVES: To attempt to define the genetic profile involved in the response to this treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We selected 100 men younger than 75 years, with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, who started anticoagulation with acenocoumarol following the same protocol: 3 mg for three consecutive days. Then, doses were individually adjusted to achieve a steady International Normalized Ratio (INR). The basal plasma level and the level after 3 days were obtained, and the INR was determined. We studied five functional polymorphisms: FVII -323 Del/Ins, CYP2C*9, VKORC1 c1173t, calumenin (CALU) R4Q and CALU a29809g. The dose required for a steady INR was also recorded. RESULTS: Only the VKORC1 genotype had significant impact on the efficacy of therapy. Carriers of the 1173t allele were significantly more sensitive to therapy for 3 days [INR 2.07 (1.59-2.87) vs. 1.74 (1.30-2.09); P = 0.015] and they needed lower acenocoumarol doses to stabilize their INR (15.8 +/- 5.6 vs. 19.5 +/- 6.0 mg week(-1); P = 0.004). Its effect was exacerbated by combination with the CALU a29809g polymorphism. Carriers of both variants (27% of the sample) achieved the highest INR [2.26 (1.70-3.32)] and required the lowest dose (14.1 +/- 5.1 mg week(-1)). This genetic profile was particularly relevant in patients with INR >or= 3.5 at the start of therapy (P = 0.005; odds ratio = 6.67, 95% confidence interval = 1.32-37.43). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that CALU a29809g might be a new genetic factor involved in the pharmacogenetics of anticoagulant therapy, and confirm that specific genetic profiles defined by different polymorphisms will determine the initial response and dose required to achieve a stable and safe INR.
17602574	Characterization of the CHEMICALIN adduct of substrate-bound GENEIN by electron paramagnetic resonance: electronic structure of the active site and mechanistic implications. GENEIN (GENEIN) is a non-heme CHEMICALIN metalloenzyme that catalyzes the first committed step in oxidative CHEMICALIN catabolism. The active site coordination of GENEIN comprises a mononuclear CHEMICALIN ligated by the Nepsilon atoms of three protein-derived CHEMICALIN, thus representing a new variant on the GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was used as a spectroscopic probe in investigating the order of substrate-CHEMICALNOTIN binding by EPR spectroscopy. In these experiments, GENEIN exhibits an ordered binding of CHEMICALIN prior to CHEMICALIN (and presumably CHEMICALIN) similar to that observed for the GENEIN. Moreover, the GENEIN active site is essentially unreactive toward CHEMICALIN in the absence of substrate, suggesting an obligate ordered binding of CHEMICALIN prior to CHEMICALIN. Typically, addition of CHEMICALNOTIN to a mononuclear non-heme CHEMICALNOTIN center results in the formation of an {CHEMICALNOTIN}7 (S = 3/2) species characterized by an axial EPR spectrum with gx, gy, and gz values of approximately 4, approximately 4, and approximately 2, respectively. However, upon addition of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN in the presence of substrate CHEMICALIN, a low-spin {CHEMICALNOTIN}7 (S = 1/2) signal that accounts for approximately 85% of the CHEMICALNOTIN within the enzyme develops. Similar {CHEMICALNOTIN}7 (S = 1/2) EPR signals have been observed for a variety of octahedral mononuclear CHEMICALNOTIN synthetic complexes; however, this type of CHEMICALNOTIN species is not commonly observed for non-heme CHEMICALNOTIN enzymes. Substitution of CHEMICALNOTIN with isosteric substrate analogues CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN did not produce any analogous {CHEMICALNOTIN}7 signals (S = 1/2 or 3/2), thus reflecting the high substrate specificity of the enzyme observed by a number of researchers. The unusual {CHEMICALNOTIN}7 (S = 1/2) electronic configuration adopted by the substrate-bound CHEMICALNOTIN GENENOTIN (termed {ES-CHEMICALNOTIN}7) is a result of the CHEMICALNOTIN coordination of CHEMICALNOTIN in the CHEMICALIN-bound GENEIN active site. DFT computations were performed to further characterize this species. The DFT-predicted geometric parameters for {ES-CHEMICALNOTIN}7 are in good agreement with the crystallographically determined substrate-bound active site configuration of GENENOTIN and are consistent with known CHEMICALNOTIN model complexes. Moreover, the computed EPR parameters (g and A values) are in excellent agreement with experimental results for this GENENOTIN species and those obtained from comparable synthetic {CHEMICALNOTIN}7 (S = 1/2) CHEMICALNOTIN complexes.
17632107	Ligand-dependent transcriptional activities of four torafugu pufferfish Takifugu rubripes GENENOTIN. Structural and functional properties were investigated for four GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, from torafugu pufferfish Takifugu rubripes and determined for their transcriptional activity by the reporter assay using reporter plasmids containing three copies of the GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN showed a high similarity in the primary structure to other vertebrate counterparts, GENENOTIN contained additional sequences of 21 and 28 CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively, as in the case of other teleost fish species when compared with African clawed frog counterparts. The transcriptional activity of torafugu GENEIN was enhanced 4.5- and 11.5-fold by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) each at 10 microM, respectively, whereas that of GENEIN, 4.5- and 7.3-fold at the same concentration of the respective ligands, respectively. The activities of torafugu GENENOTIN were also enhanced 5.6- and 6.3-fold by CHEMICALNOTIN at 1 microM, respectively, but not by CHEMICALNOTIN at this concentration. Furthermore, the activities of the two GENEIN were enhanced 4.3- and 7.6-fold by CHEMICALIN, 4.4- and 5.2-fold by CHEMICALIN, and 6.7- and 8.0-fold by CHEMICALIN each at 50 microM, respectively. On the other hand, the activities of GENENOTIN were not changed by CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, nor PUFAs. These results suggest that the activities of GENENOTIN require undefined ligands. Alternatively, the molecular mechanisms involved in their activation are different from those of other vertebrates.
17643344	Combination chemotherapy with a GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN in a mouse model of human African trypanosomiasis. Drug therapy for late-stage (encephalitic) human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is currently very unsatisfactory with the most commonly used drug, CHEMICALNOTIN, having a 5% overall mortality. There is evidence in a mouse model of HAT that GENENOTIN antagonism reduces the neuroinflammatory reaction to CNS trypanosome infection. In this study we investigated the effects of combination chemotherapy with CHEMICALNOTIN and a GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) in this mouse model. The CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN drug combination did not produce any clinical signs of illness in mice with CNS trypanosome infection. This lack of any additional or unexpected CNS toxicity in the mouse model of CNS HAT provides valuable safety data for the future possible use of this drug combination in patients with late-stage HAT.
17652763	Identification of the GENENOTIN. PURPOSE: GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), transcribed from the GENENOTIN gene, is a GENEIN with 316 CHEMICALIN found in the CHEMICALNOTIN pigment epithelium (RPE) and in CHEMICALNOTIN Muller cells. It is thought to play a critical role in the visual cycle by functioning as an acceptor of CHEMICALIN from the GENEIN reaction. The goal here was to evaluate the functional promoter of this gene. METHODS: 5' RACE analysis, promoter-reporter assays, and semiquantitative PCR with exon-specific primers were performed using human-derived RPE cells (ARPE-19 and D407) in culture to evaluate the 5' sequence flanking the GENENOTIN gene. In addition, the GENENOTIN genes were evaluated in silico to identify likely proximal promoter/exon 1 sequences similar to the human gene. RESULTS: 5' RACE analysis revealed the presence of a previously undescribed exon in the GENENOTIN gene. This was confirmed by analysis of the GenBank Human EST database, which revealed the presence of 18 sequences matching exon 1. Exon-specific PCR revealed that most GENENOTIN transcripts expressed in ARPE-19 cells contain both exon 1 and the final exon, suggesting that the primary promoter of GENENOTIN exists 5' of the newly identified exon 1. Highly homologous sequences in the murine, bovine, and porcine genes were also identified. Finally, promoter-reporter constructs revealed a minimal sequence necessary for promoter function and indicated significantly greater promoter activity compared with previously described GENENOTIN. CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented here suggest that GENENOTIN transcripts in RPE cells contain a noncoding exon in addition to a newly described promoter and, by definition, an additional intron. This finding sets the stage for a mechanistic understanding of the high degree of cell type-specific expression of GENENOTIN.
17653133	Determination of GENENOTIN activity in the kidney. GENEIN (GENEIN) metabolizes asymmetric CHEMICALIN to generate CHEMICALIN and is present in large quantities in the kidney. We present a new study that optimizes the Prescott-Jones colorimetric assay to measure GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN generation in kidney homogenates. We found that the removal of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN is necessary since CHEMICALNOTIN also produces a positive reaction. Deproteinization with CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be optimal and that GENENOTIN inhibitors were not necessary. All assays were conducted in CHEMICALNOTIN buffer, since other common additives can create false positive and false negative reactions. GENEIN or GENEIN isoenzymes were not found to influence CHEMICALIN production. Our optimized CHEMICALIN production assay to measure GENEIN activity correlated closely with the direct measure of the rate of asymmetric CHEMICALIN consumption. Using this assay, we found that both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibit renal cortical GENEIN activity in vitro.
17660958	The role of trastuzumab in early stage breast cancer: current data and treatment recommendations. OPINION STATEMENT: Treatment of early stage breast cancer requires a multimodality approach in order to eradicate residual cancer and prevent recurrent disease. Targeting the pathways that promote or sustain cancer cell growth and invasion is critical to the effective treatment of breast and other cancers. Overexpression of the family of GENENOTIN receptors have been associated with a variety of malignancies; the first and best studied is the association of overexpression of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype and poorer survival. A humanized antibody to GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, trastuzumab, is now FDA approved for the treatment of early stage, GENEIN/GENEIN overexpressing breast cancer sequenced with chemotherapy including CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN. Additional international and national studies support the significant impact of trastuzumab on both disease free and overall survival in women with this aggressive form of breast cancer. Toxicity includes a low but clear risk of congestive heart failure, and the large phase III trials have helped to determine which patients are at higher risk for this complication. Non-CHEMICALNOTIN containing regimens are an alternative therapy associated with reduced cardiac toxicity. Trastuzumab therapy is now the standard of care for the treatment of early stage, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN positive breast cancer given in combination with one of several chemotherapy regimens. Ongoing questions include the appropriate duration of trastuzumab treatment as well as the optimal chemotherapy regimen and sequence. The next large phase III adjuvant trial for this subset of breast cancer is an international collaboration designed to evaluate the added or alternative benefit of an oral CHEMICALNOTIN kinase inhibitor targeting GENEIN/GENEIN as well as the GENEIN (GENEIN), CHEMICALIN. Other trials are investigating differences in duration. Studies in the neoadjuvant setting should help to define markers of trastuzumab and CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity and resistance. Preliminary data combining trastuzumab with the antiangiogenic antibody bevacizumab is encouraging; this combination will be tested in both early stage and late stage disease.
17662248	Stimulation of GENENOTIN modulates Jurkat T cell growth and adhesion to GENENOTIN. The aims of this study were to investigate the expression and the functional roles of GENENOTIN in leukemic Jurkat T cells. RT-PCR and immunofluorescence/confocal microscopy analysis showed that Jurkat T cells express the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunits of the GENENOTIN. Exposure of Jurkat cells to either CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN] or CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), two selective GENEIN antagonists, limited cell growth by inhibiting cell cycle progression and inducing apoptosis, whereas CHEMICALIN (1 microM) and CHEMICALIN (10 microM) significantly increased (137.2+/-22.0%; P<0.01) Jurkat T cell adhesion to GENEIN. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that Jurkat T cells express GENENOTIN functionally active in controlling cell growth and adhesion to GENENOTIN.
17673606	CHEMICALIN identifies novel antagonist binding determinants in the GENEIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a recently introduced antagonist of the GENENOTIN (GENEIN and GENEIN, respectively), currently in clinical development for use in the treatment of major depressive disorder and vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. Initial evaluation of the pharmacological properties of CHEMICALNOTIN (J Pharmacol Exp Ther 318:657-665, 2006) revealed significantly reduced potency for the GENEIN expressed in membranes compared with whole cells when competing for CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binding. Using GENEIN in transfected human embryonic kidney-293 cells, this difference in potency for CHEMICALIN at sites labeled by CHEMICALIN was found to distinguish CHEMICALIN, the CHEMICALIN analog CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN, and the CHEMICALIN analog CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) from other GENEIN antagonists, such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN antidepressants, and CHEMICALIN. These differences seem not to arise from preparation-specific perturbations of ligand intrinsic affinity or antagonist-specific surface trafficking but rather from protein conformational alterations that perturb the relationships between distinct GENENOTIN binding sites. In an initial search for molecular features that differentially define antagonist binding determinants, we document that Val148 in GENEIN selectively disrupts CHEMICALIN binding but not that of DVS.
17853709	[GENENOTIN: a link between thrombogenesis and atherogenesis]. INTRODUCTION: It is well known that numerous mechanisms of thrombogenesis can participate in every stage of atherosclerotic disease. The discovery of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and its structural similarity with GENENOTIN suggests another pathogenic link between atherogenesis and thrombogenesis. SOME CHARACTERISTICS OF GENENOTIN GENENOTIN: This lipoprotein is present in the whole human population in a wide range of plasma concentrations. It has numerous different isoforms. Its synthesis occurs in the liver, but it is practically metabolically independent from other GENENOTIN. Today, GENENOTIN GENENOTIN is considered to be an independent risk factor for heart and brain ischemic disease. FIBRINOLYTIC MECHANISMS: The primary role of the fibrinolytic mechanism is to prevent thrombus Jormation during circulation and to remove already formed ones. GENENOTIN has a central role in this process, due to the inactive proenzyme GENENOTIN. Its basic activators are GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The most important inhibitors of GENENOTIN are GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN). Structural similarity of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN The GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes are very closely linked on the long arm of chromosome 6. Because of that they are structuraly very similar and they have a cross immunological reactivity. Their common elements are so-called "kringle" structures. The key difference in structure of GENEIN and GENEIN is replacement of CHEMICALIN with CHEMICALIN at position 560. This prevents splitting of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN AND FIBRINOLYSIS: GENENOTIN GENENOTIN inhibits activation of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN. It is also a competitive inhibitor of GENENOTIN for its binding to GENENOTIN. Furthermore, it successfully achieves competitive inhibition of GENENOTIN for binding to GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Also, GENENOTIN inhibits activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). It positively correlates with GENENOTIN and it is assumed that it promotes release of GENENOTIN pathway inhibitor (17FPI) from endothelial cell surfaces. CONCLUSION: In regulation of the hemostatic system via GENENOTIN antifibrinolytic effects, GENENOTIN GENENOTIN ojfers a molecular solution to the link between thrombogenesis and atherogenesis.
17935273	CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitors in renal cancer. Understanding the alterations in cellular protein interactions and their relations to genetic mutations that cause renal cell carcinoma (RCC) provides a unique opportunity for the development of disease-specific therapy for patients with advanced forms of this disease. There is substantial evidence of an association between mutation on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) gene and the earliest stages of tumorigenesis of RCC. The main consequence of GENENOTIN loss is the upregulation of downstream proangiogenic factors leading to highly vascular tumors. Overexpression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is also caused by the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a key component of signaling pathways inside the cell, involved in cell proliferation. The inhibition of proangiogenic factors and GENENOTIN was the main idea behind the development of new targeted agents in advanced RCC. Since December 2005, 3 targeted agents have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced RCC: CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are synthetic, orally active agents shown to directly inhibit GENENOTIN (GENEIN, GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN), while CHEMICALIN is an GENEIN inhibitor. Recent clinical studies form the basis for new guidelines for the treatment of advanced RCC: CHEMICALNOTIN should be used as a second-line treatment, CHEMICALNOTIN as the first-line therapy for good and intermediate-risk patients, and CHEMICALNOTIN should be considered as first-line treatment for poor-risk patients. Future approaches to targeted therapy should focus on optimizing the use of current active drugs, exploring their combinations or investigating their sequential use. In addition, it is important to define the mechanisms of resistance on their use and to further investigate biomarkers and enhance treatment efficacy for the individual patients. The development of these targeted therapies represents an exciting step forward in the treatment of advanced RCC.
18034539	Management of psoriasis: the position of CHEMICALNOTIN drugs. Oral synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN have been established as effective systemic therapy for psoriasis since their introduction for clinical use in the 1970s; a compound for topical use, CHEMICALNOTIN has been recently marketed. Despite the demonstrated clinical success of CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in psoriasis, its mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated, and investigators are confronted with two paradoxes. One is that the binding of CHEMICALIN to nuclear GENEIN (GENEIN) does not match their therapeutic efficacy: CHEMICALNOTIN activates the three receptor subtypes, GENENOTIN, without measurable receptor binding, whereas CHEMICALIN preferentially binds to and activates GENENOTIN in preference to GENEIN. The other is that there is already increased formation of CHEMICALNOTIN in the psoriatic lesion. Answering these questions should result in better use of these drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. Oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN remains one of the first therapeutic choices for severe psoriasis, particularly in association with ultraviolet light therapy, of which it may decrease the carcinogenic risk. Topical CHEMICALNOTIN is suitable for moderate plaque psoriasis. Its efficacy and tolerability can be enhanced by the addition of topical CHEMICALNOTIN; its irritative potential is counterbalanced by a sustained therapeutic effect after the treatment is stopped.
18035186	Comprehensive review of CHEMICALIN, a second-generation GENEIN inhibitor, for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. BACKGROUND: Inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) with selectivity and specificity for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) prolong the duration of action of both endogenously and exogenously derived CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN] is a second-generation CHEMICALIN pharmacophore that selectively and irreversibly inhibits brain GENEIN and is specifically designed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to review the pharmacology, tolerability, and clinical efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of PD. METHODS: MEDLINE (1966-April 2007), the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2007) were searched for original research and review articles published in English. The search terms were GENENOTIN, neuroprotection, Parkinson disease, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. The reference lists of articles were also consulted, as was information provided by the manufacturer of CHEMICALNOTIN. RESULTS: Data from 63 clinical and laboratory studies were analyzed. Based on the results from those studies, we concluded that CHEMICALIN PO QD, at the therapeutic dosage range of 0.5 to 1 rag/d, is effective and well tolerated and completely, selectively, and specifically inhibited GENEIN. Pharmacologically, CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be < or =10-fold more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN and was not metabolized to CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives. CHEMICALNOTIN was effective both as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive treatment in patients with advancing PD and motor fluctuations. As monotherapy, CHEMICALNOTIN provided modest yet clinically meaningful benefit. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study found that, after 26 weeks of treatment, the adjusted effect size for total Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale score was -4.20 (95% CI, -5.66 to -2.73) for rasagiline 1 mg/d versus placebo (P < 0.001). Preliminary long-term data from an open-label study suggest a sustained therapeutic advantage when rasagiline is initiated early (before the need for dopaminergic agents) rather than later. In patients with more advanced disease who received treatment with dopaminergic agents, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were associated with reductions of "off" time significantly greater than placebo (-1.18 and -1.2 vs 0.4 hour; both, P < or = 0.001). CHEMICALNOTIN was well tolerated in younger (aged <;70 years) and older (aged > or =70 years) patients with early or advanced PD. Pharmacologically, rasagiline has the potential to augment the vasopressor effects of diet-derived CHEMICALNOTIN (ie, the "cheese reaction"). However, clinical challenge studies of CHEMICALNOTIN have found this unlikely to occur even with ingestion of supraphysiologic amounts of CHEMICALNOTIN. In experimental models, CHEMICALIN has been found to have neuroprotective properties that may be independent of GENEIN inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this review, CHEMICALNOTIN has been found to be well tolerated and effective in the treatment of early PD and as adjunctive treatment in motor fluctuations. Whether rasagiline is associated with clinically significant neuroprotection (ie, disease modification) in PD is the subject of ongoing clinical trials.
18056711	Mutation of Gly721 alters GENEIN active site architecture and sensitivity to CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) catalyzes the relaxation of supercoiled DNA via a concerted mechanism of DNA strand cleavage and religation. GENEIN is the cellular target of the anti-cancer drug CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which reversibly stabilizes a covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate. GENEIN clamps around duplex DNA, wherein the core and CHEMICALIN-terminal domains are connected by extended GENEIN (GENEIN), which position the active site CHEMICALIN of the CHEMICALIN-terminal domain within the catalytic pocket. The physical connection of the linker with the GENEIN clamp as well as linker flexibility affect enzyme sensitivity to CHEMICALIN. Crystallographic data reveal that a conserved CHEMICALIN residue (located at the juncture between the linker and CHEMICALIN-terminal domains) is at one end of a short GENEIN, which extends to the active site CHEMICALIN covalently linked to the DNA. In the presence of drug, the linker is rigid and this GENEIN extends to include CHEMICALIN and the preceding CHEMICALIN. We report that mutation of this conserved CHEMICALIN in GENEIN alters enzyme sensitivity to CHEMICALIN. Mutating CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced enzyme CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity, with the acidic residues inducing the greatest increase in drug sensitivity in vivo and in vitro. By contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN substituents rendered the enzyme CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant. Mutation-induced alterations in enzyme architecture preceding the active site CHEMICALNOTIN suggest these structural transitions modulate enzyme sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN, while enhancing the rate of DNA cleavage. We postulate that this conserved CHEMICALIN residue provides a flexible hinge within the GENEIN catalytic pocket to facilitate linker dynamics and the structural alterations that accompany drug binding of the covalent enzyme-DNA intermediate.
18081314	Characterization of the substrate mimic bound to engineered GENENOTIN in solution using high-resolution NMR spectroscopy and mutagenesis: implication of the molecular mechanism in biosynthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN. High-resolution NMR spectroscopy was used to determine the docking of a substrate (CHEMICALIN) mimic (CHEMICALIN) to the engineered GENEIN (GENEIN) in solution. The binding of CHEMICALIN to the GENEIN protein was demonstrated by 1D NMR titration, and the significant perturbation of the chemical shifts of protons at CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN of CHEMICALIN were observed upon CHEMICALIN binding to the engineered GENEIN in a concentration-dependent manner. The detailed conformational change and 3D structure of the GENEIN-bound CHEMICALIN were further demonstrated by 2D CHEMICALNOTIN NMR experiments using the transferred NOE technique. The distances between the protons CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are shorter following their binding to the GENEIN in solution-down to within 5 A. These shorter distances resulted in a widely open conformation, where the triangle shape of the unbound CHEMICALNOTIN changed to a more compact conformation with an oval shape. The bound conformation of CHEMICALIN fits the crystal structure of the GENEIN substrate binding pocket considerably better than that of the unbound CHEMICALNOTIN. The residues important to the substrate binding in the active site pocket of GENENOTIN were also predicted. For example, Trp282 could be one of the most important residues and is suspected to play a role in the determination of specific catalytic function, which has been established by the docking studies using the NMR structure of the GENEIN-bound form of CHEMICALIN and the GENEIN crystal structure. These studies have provided the structural information for the interaction of the GENENOTIN with its substrate mimic. The noted conformational changes where the CHEMICALNOTIN position is closer to the CHEMICALNOTIN position of CHEMICALIN provided the first experimental data for understanding the molecular mechanism of the catalytic function of GENEIN in the isomerization of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN.
18220763	Type 2 diabetes and oral antihyperglycemic drugs. Type II diabetes is a heterogeneous disease where environment and genetics are important factors for the expression of the disease. The high cost for treating complications of diabetes is a burden for public health systems and governments worldwide. Type II diabetes has been causing debilitation worldwide for many decades, and a single drug that safely treats the disease has yet to be discovered. Sulfonylureas, biguanides, alpha-glucosidase, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors and thiazolidinediones are among the classes of oral hypoglycemic drugs available to treat Type II diabetes, but concerns exist regarding safety and efficacy of these drugs. In this article we present the pros and cons of the six classes and discuss some of the latest advances towards the development of new drugs for the treatment of Type II diabetes.
18308814	Asenapine: a novel psychopharmacologic agent with a unique human receptor signature. Asenapine is a novel psychopharmacologic agent under development for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We determined and compared the human receptor binding affinities and functional characteristics of asenapine and several antipsychotic drugs. Compounds were tested under comparable assay conditions using cloned human receptors. In comparison with the antipsychotics, asenapine showed high affinity and a different rank order of binding affinities (pKi) for serotonin receptors (5-HT1A [8.6], 5-HT1B [8.4], 5-HT2A [10.2], 5-HT2B [9.8], 5-HT2C [10.5], 5-HT5 [8.8], 5-HT6 [9.6] and 5-HT7 [9.9]), adrenoceptors (alpha1 [8.9], alpha2A [8.9], alpha2B [9.5] and alpha2C [8.9]), dopamine receptors (D1 [8.9], D2 [8.9], D3 [9.4] and D4 [9.0]) and histamine receptors (H1 [9.0] and H2 [8.2]). It had much lower affinity (pKi<or=5) for muscarinic receptors and was the only agent with affinity for H2 receptors. Relative to its D2 receptor affinity, asenapine had a higher affinity for 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, 5-HT6, alpha2B and D3 receptors, suggesting stronger engagement of these targets at therapeutic doses. Asenapine behaved as a potent antagonist (pKB) at 5-HT1A (7.4), 5-HT1B (8.1), 5-HT2A (9.0), 5-HT2B (9.3), 5-HT2C (9.0), 5-HT6 (8.0), 5-HT7 (8.5), D2 (9.1), D3 (9.1), alpha2A (7.3), alpha2B (8.3), alpha2C (6.8) and H1 (8.4) receptors. These functional effects differed from those of risperidone (pKB<5 for 5-HT6) and olanzapine (pKB<5 for 5-HT1A and alpha2). Our results indicate that asenapine has a unique human receptor signature, with binding affinity and antagonistic properties that differ appreciably from those of antipsychotic drugs.
18393142	Current and future prospects for anticoagulant therapy: inhibitors of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Indirect systemic and direct oral factor Xa and direct oral GENENOTIN inhibitors with improved pharmacologic profiles compared with heparins and CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists are currently in clinical development. This overview focuses on the indirect antithrombin dependent CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN and on the most advanced oral direct inhibitors to GENEIN (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) and IIa (CHEMICALNOTIN). Specifically, the results of dose-finding studies for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after elective orthopedic surgery, the results of dose-finding studies for treatment of acute venous thromboembolism including prolonged prophylaxis of recurrent events, and the designs of ongoing clinical trials are reviewed.
18423812	Triple pharmacological blockade of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN system in nondiabetic CKD: an open-label crossover randomized controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Agents inhibiting the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN (RAAS) system have an important role in slowing the progression of chronic kidney disease. We evaluated the hypothesis that the addition of an GENENOTIN antagonist to an GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitor and GENENOTIN blocker (ARB) (triple RAAS blockade) may provide an additional benefit compared with an GENENOTIN inhibitor and ARB (double RAAS blockade). DESIGN: Randomized open controlled crossover study. SETTING & PARTICIPANTS: 18 whites (7 women, 11 men) from the Outpatient Department of Nephrology with chronic nondiabetic proteinuric kidney diseases, mean age 42.4 +/- 1.9 years (SEM). INTERVENTIONS: In the 8-week run-in period, all participants received the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (5 mg), the ARB CHEMICALNOTINn (80 mg), and the diuretic CHEMICALNOTIN (12.5 mg) as double RAAS blockade to achieve the target blood pressure of less than 130/80 mm Hg. Participants were then randomly assigned to 2 treatment sequences, either the addition of CHEMICALNOTIN (25 mg) (triple RAAS blockade) through 8 weeks followed by double RAAS blockade through 8 weeks (sequence 1) or double RAAS blockade followed by triple RAAS blockade (sequence 2). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: 24-hour urine protein excretion (primary end point) and markers of tubular injury and fibrosis (secondary end points). Analysis was performed using analysis of variance for repeated measurements. RESULTS: At baseline, mean serum creatinine level was 1.16 +/- 0.09 mg/dL (103 +/- 8 micromol/L), estimated glomerular filtration rate was 107.8 mL/min (95% confidence interval, 93 to 140.9 [1.8 mL/s; 95% confidence interval, 1.55 to 2.35; Cockcroft-Gault formula), and 24-hour mean proteinuria was 0.97 +/- 0.18 g. Mean urine protein excretion was 0.7 g/24 h (95% confidence interval, 0.48 to 0.92) less after triple RAAS blockade than after double RAAS blockade (P = 0.01), without change in blood pressure. Urine excretion of GENENOTIN (P = 0.02) and amino-terminal propeptide of GENENOTIN (P = 0.05) also significantly decreased. CHEMICALNOTIN levels increased significantly after triple therapy (P = 0.02). However, no patient was withdrawn because of adverse effects. LIMITATIONS: Absence of blinding, small sample size, short treatment period, absence of histological assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of an GENENOTIN antagonist in addition to double RAAS blockade with an GENENOTIN inhibitor and ARB may slow the progression of chronic kidney disease. Additional studies are necessary to confirm this result.
18439678	Porcine GENEIN and GENEIN are both activated by a selective GENEIN ligand, CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are a family of highly conserved germline-encoded GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which are utilized by the innate immune system to recognize microbial components, known as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP). We cloned and characterized porcine GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes from pig lymph node tissue. Sequence analysis showed that the aa sequence identities of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN are 85, 78 and 90%, respectively, whereas GENENOTIN aa sequence identities with GENENOTIN are 73, 69 and 79%, respectively. Both GENEIN and GENEIN proteins were expressed in cell lines and were CHEMICALIN-glycosylated. The stimulatory activity of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN ligands to GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in transiently transfected Cos-7 and 293T cells were analyzed using a GENENOTIN reporter assay. Two CHEMICALIN molecules, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, markedly activated both GENEIN and GENEIN whereas only GENEIN, but not GENEIN, was activated by the ligands. Therefore, receptor specificity for GENENOTIN is clearly species specific. We further showed that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are located intracellularly and are mainly within the endoplasmic reticulum. Moreover, activation of transfected cells and porcine PBMC by GENEIN ligands was inhibited by CHEMICALIN indicating the requirement of endosomal/lysosomal acidification for activation of the receptors.
18574460	High-affinity blockade of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN analogues. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: GENENOTIN constitute major target sites for local anaesthetic-like action. The clinical use of local anaesthetics is still limited by severe side effects, in particular, arrhythmias and convulsions. These side effects render the search for new local anaesthetics a matter of high interest. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We have investigated the effects of three halogenated structural analogues of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and the effect of one compound (CHEMICALNOTIN) on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cell line 293. KEY RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN-, CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN reversibly suppressed depolarization-induced whole-cell CHEMICALNOTIN inward currents with high potency. The IC(50) for block of resting channels at -150 mV was 2.3, 3.9 and 11.3 microM in GENENOTIN, respectively, and 29.2 microM for CHEMICALIN in GENEIN. Membrane depolarization inducing inactivation strongly increased the blocking potency of all compounds. Estimated affinities for the fast-inactivated channel state were 81 nM, 312 nM and 227 nM for CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN in GENEIN, and 450 nM for CHEMICALIN in GENEIN. Recovery from fast inactivation was prolonged in the presence of drug leading to an accumulation of block during repetitive stimulation at high frequencies (100 Hz). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: CHEMICALIN analogues constitute a novel class of GENEIN-blocking drugs possessing almost 100-fold higher potency compared with the local anaesthetic and anti-arrhythmic drug CHEMICALIN. Preferential drug binding to inactivated channel states suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN analogues might be especially effective in suppressing ectopic discharges in a variety of pathological conditions.
18627212	CHEMICALNOTIN: a review of its use in hypertension and diabetic nephropathy. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), an GENEIN antagonist, is approved in many countries worldwide for the treatment of hypertension. It is also approved in some regions for the treatment of nephropathy in patients with hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. In adults with essential hypertension, CHEMICALNOTIN is effective at reducing blood pressure (BP) over a 24-hour period with once-daily administration. CHEMICALNOTIN also slows the progression of renal disease in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, with this effect partly independent of its BP-lowering effect. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN is a useful treatment option for patients with hypertension, including those with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy.
18773878	DNA damage and homologous recombination signaling induced by CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation. DNA damage is accepted as a consequence of CHEMICALIN deprivation induced by chemotherapeutic inhibitors of GENEIN (GENEIN), but the types of damage and signaling responses remain incompletely understood. CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation increases dUTP and CHEMICALNOTIN in DNA, which is removed by base excision repair (BER). Because BER requires a synthesis step, strand break intermediates presumably accumulate. CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation also induces cell cycle arrest during replication. Homologous recombination (HR) is a means of repairing persistent BER intermediates and collapsed replication forks. There are also intimate links between HR and S-phase checkpoint pathways. In this study, the goals were to determine the involvement of HR-associated proteins and DNA damage signaling responses to CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation. When GENEIN, which is a central component of HR, was depleted by siRNA cells were sensitized to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which specifically inhibits GENEIN. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in mammalian cells that depletion of GENENOTIN causes sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation. Activation of DNA damage signaling responses was examined following treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN. Phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN subunit) and formation of damage-induced foci were strikingly evident following IC(50) doses of CHEMICALIN. Induction was much more striking following CHEMICALNOTIN treatment than with CHEMICALNOTIN, which is commonly used to inhibit replication. CHEMICALIN treatment also induced foci of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, although the extent of co-localization with GENEIN foci varied. Collectively, the results suggest that HR and S-phase checkpoint signaling processes are invoked by CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation and influence cellular resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation.
18954704	Corticosteroids and human recombinant activated protein C for septic shock. This article summarizes the current knowledge on the benefit/risk profile from the use of low-dose corticosteroids and activated protein C in treating septic shock. Physicians should consider using low-dose corticosteroids and drotrecogin alpha activated in the treatment of patients who have vasopressor-dependent septic shock with persistent signs of hypoperfusion, organ dysfunction, or hypotension. The optimal timing for initiating these treatments is from 6 to 24 hours from onset of shock. When patients are receiving these drugs, physicians should systematically screen for superinfection and serious bleeding events.
18996527	Adipose tissue as a source of GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyses the conversion of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN and plays an important role in hepatic detoxification reactions. Here we show that, in addition to the liver, 3T3-L1 adipocytes as well as human and murine adipose tissue explants express high amounts of enzymatically active GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN mRNA levels and enzyme activity increased in 3T3-L1 cells in a differentiation-dependent manner. CHEMICALIN, the atherogenic product of the GENEIN-catalyzed reaction, was secreted from 3T3-L1 cells or adipose tissue cultures. CHEMICALNOTIN release increased during 3T3-L1 differentiation and was reduced when adipose tissue was treated with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a widely used drug to lower elevated plasma lipid levels, induced GENEIN enzyme activity in white adipose tissue of mice. In tissue culture CHEMICALNOTIN treatment led to an increase in adipose tissue CHEMICALNOTIN secretion. These data support the concept that adipose tissue GENEIN contributes to the increased plasma CHEMICALIN levels in patients treated with CHEMICALIN.
19029287	Expression and CHEMICALIN-binding properties of brain GENEIN isoforms. The GENEIN (GENEIN) isoforms GENEIN and GENEIN display similar CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binding properties and are both expressed in mammalian brain. Recent work implicates GENENOTIN channels as interesting drug targets, but no isoform-selective modulators exist. It is also unknown to what extent GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN contribute to L-type-specific CHEMICALNOTIN binding activity in brain. To address this question and to determine whether DHPs can discriminate between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN binding pockets, we combined radioreceptor assays and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We bred double mutants (GENENOTIN-DM) from mice expressing mutant GENENOTIN channels [GENENOTINDHP(-/-)] lacking high affinity for DHPs and from GENENOTIN knockouts [GENENOTIN(-/-)]. CHEMICALIN binding to GENENOTINDHP(-/-) and GENEIN-DM brains was reduced to 15.1 and 4.4% of wild type, respectively, indicating that GENEIN accounts for 10.7% of brain GENEIN. qPCR revealed that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunits comprised 0.08% of the GENENOTIN transcripts in mouse whole brain, suggesting that they cannot account for the residual binding. Instead, this could be explained by low-affinity binding (127-fold K(d) increase) to the mutated GENENOTIN channels. Inhibition of CHEMICALIN binding to GENENOTINDHP(-/-) (predominantly GENEIN) and wild-type (predominantly GENEIN) brain membranes by unlabeled DHPs revealed a 3- to 4-fold selectivity of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for the GENEIN binding pocket, a finding further confirmed with heterologously expressed channels. This suggests that small differences in their binding pockets may allow development of isoform-selective modulators for GENENOTIN and that, because of their very low expression, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are unlikely to serve as drug targets to treat CNS diseases.
19039322	Global target profile of the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN in primary chronic myeloid leukemia cells. The detailed molecular mechanism of action of second-generation GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN GENENOTIN inhibitors, including perturbed targets and pathways, should contribute to rationalized therapy in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) or in other affected diseases. Here, we characterized the target profile of the dual GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN employing a two-tiered approach using chemical proteomics to identify natural binders in whole cell lysates of primary CML and K562 cells in parallel to in vitro GENENOTIN assays against a large recombinant GENENOTIN panel. The combined strategy resulted in a global survey of CHEMICALNOTIN targets comprised of over 45 novel GENENOTIN. We have found clear differences in the target patterns of CHEMICALNOTIN in primary CML cells versus the K562 cell line. A comparison of CHEMICALIN with CHEMICALIN across the whole GENEIN panel revealed overlapping, but distinct, inhibition profiles. Common among those were the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN family GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN did not inhibit GENEIN or GENEIN, but prominently targeted the apoptosis-linked GENEIN. Although in vivo CHEMICALIN is inactive against GENEIN GENEIN, we found this clinically important mutant to be enzymatically inhibited in the mid-nanomolar range. Finally, CHEMICALIN is the first GENEIN inhibitor shown to target GENEIN, recently implicated in myeloid leukemia cell proliferation.
1908244	The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives on microtubule assembly in vitro depends on the charge of the substituent. CHEMICALNOTIN, and derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN with a charged substituent at position 17 on the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety, have been investigated for their effects on bovine brain microtubules in vitro. The negatively charged CHEMICALIN has been found previously to be a GENEIN (GENEIN)-dependent microtubule inhibitor [Wallin M, Deinum J and Friden B, FEBS Lett 179: 289-293, 1985]. In the present study the binding of CHEMICALNOTIN to GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was investigated. Both these GENEIN were found to have two to three binding sites for CHEMICALIN which is compatible with the reported number of basic CHEMICALIN repeats of these GENEIN, considered to be the ultimate GENEIN binding domains. The Kd for the binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN was estimated to be 20 microM at 4 degrees, and for the binding of tau, 200 microM. The rate of dissociation was very low (T1/2 greater than 2 hr), which indicates that the binding of CHEMICALNOTIN may stabilize the protein-drug complex by changing the protein conformation. Two new negatively charged CHEMICALIN derivatives, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, were found to be similar GENEIN-dependent microtubule inhibitors. The concentration for 50% inhibition of assembly was 100 microM for the CHEMICALNOTIN derivative, the same as found previously for CHEMICALNOTIN, and 250 microM for the more bulky CHEMICALNOTIN. A positively charged derivative, CHEMICALIN, did not inhibit microtubule assembly or alter the composition of the coassembled GENEIN. The morphology of the microtubules was, however, affected. The uncharged CHEMICALIN bound to both GENEIN and GENEIN, but no effects were seen on microtubule assembly, the composition of coassembled GENEIN or the microtubule morphology. Our results suggest that only negatively charged CHEMICALIN derivatives have a GENEIN-dependent microtubule inhibitory effect. The two new negatively charged derivatives could therefore be valuable tools in the study of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interactions. The results also confirm that these interactions between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are mainly electrostatic.
1911436	Analysis of coenzyme binding by GENEIN and GENEIN using CHEMICALIN, an affinity labeling cofactor analog. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN copurify as a single, homogeneous protein from human placental microsomes. Affinity alkylation with 2 CHEMICALNOTIN suggests that the GENEIN and isomerase substrate CHEMICALIN bind at different sites on the same protein. However, the coenzyme, CHEMICALNOTIN, completely abolishes the alkylation of both enzyme activities by the CHEMICALNOTIN analog [Thomas J .L., Myers R. P., Rosik L. O. and Strickler R. C., J. Steroid Biochem. 36 (1990) 117-123]. Unlike bacterial GENEIN, the human isomerase reaction is stimulated by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN). The affinity labeling CHEMICALIN analog, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), inactivates the GENEIN and isomerase activities at similar rates in an irreversible manner which follows first order kinetics with respect to both time and alkylator concentration (0.2-0.6 mM). FSA is a cofactor site-directed reagent that binds with similar affinity as a competitive inhibitor of CHEMICALIN reduction by GENEIN (Ki = 162 microM) or as a stimulator of isomerase (Km = 153 microM). Parallel plots derived from Kitz and Wilson analysis indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN inactivates the two enzyme activities with equal alkylation efficiency (k3/Ki = 1/slope = 0.51/mol-s for both). The CHEMICALIN substrate, CHEMICALIN, protects isomerase as well as GENEIN from inactivation by CHEMICALIN. These observations are evidence for a single cofactor binding region which services both enzyme activities.
19149483	GENENOTIN blockers: new hope for successful cancer therapy. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are attractive targets for cancer therapy, as quite often their abnormal signaling has been linked with tumor development and growth. Constitutive activated GENENOTIN stimulate multiple signaling pathways responsible for DNA repair, apoptosis, and cell proliferation. During the last few years, thorough analysis of the mechanism underlying GENENOTIN's activity led to novel cancer therapy using GENENOTIN blockers. These drugs are remarkably effective in the treatment of various human tumors including head and neck, gastric, prostate and breast cancer and leukemias. The most successful example of GENEIN blockers is CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), the inhibitor of GENEIN/GENEIN oncoprotein, which has become a first-line therapy for chronic myelogenous leukemia. The introduction of CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of leukemia in clinical oncology has had a dramatic impact on how this disease is currently managed. Others kinase inhibitors used recently in cancer therapy include CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) specific for GENEIN GENEIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) specific for GENEIN GENEIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) specific for GENEIN kinase. The following GENEIN blockers for treatment of various human tumors are in clinical development: CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN). Herein, we discuss the chemistry, biological activity and clinical potential of new drugs with GENENOTIN blockers for cancer treatment.
19300583	Transdermal CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Non-selective inhibition of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) enzymes (ie, isoforms A and B) in the brain are associated with clinically significant antidepressant effects. In the US, the CHEMICALNOTIN transdermal system (STS; EMSAM) is the first antidepressant transdermal delivery system to receive Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved labeling for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Currently, the use of orally administered GENEIN inhibitor antidepressants (eg, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is limited by the risk of CHEMICALIN-provoked events (eg, acute hypertension and headache, also known as the "cheese reaction") when combined with dietary CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN transdermal system is the only MAOI available in the US for the treatment of MDD that does not require dietary restriction at the clinically effective dose of 6 mg/24 hours. Delivery of selegiline transdermally (EMSAM((R))) bypasses hepatic first pass metabolism, thereby avoiding significant inhibition of gastrointestinal and hepatic GENENOTIN activity (ie, reduced risk of CHEMICALNOTIN-provoked events) while still providing sufficient levels of CHEMICALNOTIN in the brain to produce an antidepressant effect. At dosages of 6-12 mg/24 hours, EMSAM has been shown to improve symptoms of depression, have good tolerability, and have high rates of medication adherence. However, at higher doses of EMSAM (ie, 9 mg/24 hours or more), dietary restriction of CHEMICALNOTIN intake is recommended. The introduction of EMSAM overcomes many of the safety concerns affiliated with the conventional oral GENENOTIN inhibitors and EMSAM may be considered another strategy for the treatment of MDD, especially in patients who cannot tolerate oral antidepressants, are poorly adherent, who present with atypical depressive symptoms, or have failed other antidepressants.
19445548	CHEMICALNOTIN: a review of its use in attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN(R)) is a selective CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) reuptake inhibitor that is not classified as a stimulant, and is indicated for use in patients with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). CHEMICALNOTIN is effective and generally well tolerated. It is significantly more effective than placebo and standard current therapy and does not differ significantly from or is noninferior to immediate-release CHEMICALNOTIN; however, it is significantly less effective than the extended-release CHEMICALNOTIN formulation OROS(R) CHEMICALNOTIN (hereafter referred to as osmotically released CHEMICALNOTIN) and extended-release mixed CHEMICALNOTIN salts. CHEMICALNOTIN can be administered either as a single daily dose or split into two evenly divided doses, has a negligible risk of abuse or misuse, and is not a controlled substance in the US. CHEMICALNOTIN is particularly useful for patients at risk of substance abuse, as well as those who have co-morbid anxiety or tics, or who do not wish to take a controlled substance. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN is a useful option in the treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents. The mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN is unclear, but is thought to be related to its selective inhibition of presynaptic CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake in the prefrontal cortex. CHEMICALIN has a high affinity and selectivity for GENEIN, but little or no affinity for various GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN has a demonstrated ability to selectively inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN uptake in humans and animals, and studies have shown that it preferentially binds to areas of known high distribution of noradrenergic neurons, such as the fronto-cortical subsystem. CHEMICALNOTIN was generally associated with statistically, but not clinically, significant increases in both heart rate and blood pressure in pediatric patients with ADHD. While there was an initial loss in expected height and weight among CHEMICALNOTIN recipients, this eventually returned to normal in the longer term. Data suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN is unlikely to have any abuse potential. CHEMICALNOTIN appeared less likely than CHEMICALNOTIN to exacerbate disordered sleep in pediatric patients with ADHD. CHEMICALNOTIN is rapidly absorbed, and demonstrates dose-proportional increases in plasma exposure. It undergoes extensive biotransformation, which is affected by poor metabolism by GENEIN in a small percentage of the population; these patients have greater exposure to and slower elimination of CHEMICALIN than extensive metabolizers. Patients with hepatic insufficiency show an increase in CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. GENEIN inhibitors, such as CHEMICALIN, are associated with changes in CHEMICALIN pharmacokinetics similar to those observed among poor GENEIN metabolizers. Once- or twice-daily CHEMICALNOTIN was effective in the short-term treatment of ADHD in children and adolescents, as observed in several well designed placebo-controlled trials. CHEMICALNOTIN also demonstrated efficacy in the longer term treatment of these patients. A single morning dose was shown to be effective into the evening, and discontinuation of CHEMICALNOTIN was not associated with symptom rebound. CHEMICALNOTIN efficacy did not appear to differ between children and adolescents. Stimulant-naive patients also responded well to CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. CHEMICALNOTIN did not differ significantly from or was noninferior to immediate-release CHEMICALNOTIN in children and adolescents with ADHD with regard to efficacy, and was significantly more effective than standard current therapy (any combination of medicines [excluding CHEMICALNOTIN] and/or behavioral counseling, or no treatment). However, CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly less effective than osmotically released CHEMICALNOTIN and extended-release mixed CHEMICALNOTIN salts. The efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN did not appear to be affected by the presence of co-morbid disorders, and symptoms of the co-morbid disorders were not affected or were improved by CHEMICALNOTIN administration. Health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) appeared to be positively affected by CHEMICALNOTIN in both short- and long-term studies; CHEMICALNOTIN also improved HR-QOL to a greater extent than standard current therapy. CHEMICALNOTIN was generally well tolerated in children and adolescents with ADHD. Common adverse events included headache, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, vomiting, somnolence, and nausea. The majority of adverse events were mild or moderate; there was a very low incidence of serious adverse events. Few patients discontinued CHEMICALNOTIN treatment because of adverse events. CHEMICALNOTIN discontinuation appeared to be well tolerated, with a low incidence of discontinuation-emergent adverse events. CHEMICALIN appeared better tolerated among extensive GENEIN metabolizers than among poor metabolizers. Slight differences were evident in the adverse event profiles of CHEMICALNOTIN and stimulants, both immediate- and extended-release. Somnolence appeared more common among CHEMICALNOTIN recipients and insomnia appeared more common among stimulant recipients. A black-box warning for suicidal ideation has been published in the US prescribing information, based on findings from a meta-analysis showing that CHEMICALNOTIN is associated with a significantly higher incidence of suicidal ideation than placebo. Rarely, CHEMICALNOTIN may also be associated with serious liver injury; postmarketing data show that three patients have had liver-related adverse events deemed probably related to CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Treatment algorithms involving the initial use of CHEMICALNOTIN appear cost effective versus algorithms involving initial CHEMICALNOTIN (immediate- or extended-release), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN antidepressants, or no treatment in stimulant-naive, -failed, and -contraindicated children and adolescents with ADHD. The incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year is below commonly accepted cost-effectiveness thresholds, as shown in several Markov model analyses conducted from the perspective of various European countries, with a time horizon of 1 year.
19531491	Novel inhibitors complexed with GENENOTIN: allosteric regulation by control of protein dynamics. GENEIN (GENEIN) is a homohexameric enzyme that catalyzes the reversible oxidative deamination of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN using CHEMICALIN as coenzyme. Unlike its counterparts from other animal kingdoms, GENENOTIN is regulated by a host of ligands. The recently discovered hyperinsulinism/hyperammonemia disorder showed that the loss of allosteric inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN causes excessive secretion of GENEIN. Subsequent studies demonstrated that wild-type and hyperinsulinemia/hyperammonemia forms of GENEIN are inhibited by the green tea polyphenols, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. This was followed by high throughput studies that identified more stable inhibitors, including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Shown here are the structures of GENENOTIN complexed with these three compounds. CHEMICALIN forms a ring around the internal cavity in GENEIN through aromatic stacking interactions between the drug and GENEIN as well as between the drug molecules themselves. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN both bind as pairs of stacked compounds at hexameric 2-fold axes between the dimers of subunits. The internal core of GENENOTIN contracts when the catalytic cleft closes during enzymatic turnover. None of the drugs cause conformational changes in the contact residues, but all bind to key interfaces involved in this contraction process. Therefore, it seems likely that the drugs inhibit enzymatic turnover by inhibiting this transition. Indeed, this expansion/contraction process may play a major role in the inter-subunit communication and allosteric regulation observed in GENENOTIN.
19690271	The effect of a peripheral block on inflammation-induced CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN expression in rats. BACKGROUND: Peripheral inflammatory pain is associated with an upregulation of spinal cord GENEIN (GENEIN), with a subsequent increase in central CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) levels associated with the development of hyperalgesia. In this study, we evaluated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN administered via a nerve block or via a systemic route on the spinal expression of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN in a model of peripheral inflammation in rats. METHODS: All rats randomly received three injections: 1) a left subcutaneous hindpaw injection (0.2 mL with either carrageenan 2% w/v or saline), 2) a left sciatic block (0.2 mL with either CHEMICALNOTIN 0.5% or saline), and 3) a systemic injection (subcutaneous interscapular with 0.2 mL with either CHEMICALNOTIN 0.5% or saline). Local edema, thermal, and mechanical hyperalgesia as well as cerebrospinal fluid CHEMICALNOTIN concentration and GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression in the spinal cord in dorsal root ganglions were measured. RESULTS: We confirmed that a CHEMICALNOTIN block attenuates hyperalgesia and local inflammation in a model of inflammatory pain. This effect was associated with an inhibition of the increase in GENENOTIN expression induced by peripheral inflammation in dorsal root ganglions and cord. The subsequent production of CHEMICALNOTIN in cerebrospinal fluid was also impaired. Systemic CHEMICALIN did not modify either the hyperalgesia and local inflammation or GENEIN expression. CONCLUSION: These results constitute a key element strongly suggesting that local anesthetics act at a different level when administered systematically or via a nerve block.
1978244	Two pharmacologically distinct GENENOTIN subtypes in the contraction of rabbit aorta: each subtype couples with a different CHEMICALNOTIN signalling mechanism and plays a different physiological role. Using the GENEIN subtype-selective antagonists CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, we have examined the possible heterogeneity in the GENENOTIN populations in rabbit aorta. The GENENOTIN alkylating agent CEC selectively inhibited the phasic component of the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contractile response, with little effect on the tonic component. The GENENOTIN occupancy-response relationship defined by the CHEMICALNOTIN inactivation method was rectangular hyperbolic for the tonic response, whereas that for the phasic response was linear, indicating the different degree of receptor reserve for the two responses. Radioligand binding studies with the nonselective GENEIN antagonist radioligand CHEMICALIN showed that 73-87% of the binding sites in rabbit aorta are CHEMICALIN sensitive and they are predominantly low affinity sites both for CHEMICALIN (pKd = 8.1) and for CHEMICALIN (pKd = 7.1). Moreover, GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) hydrolysis was CHEMICALNOTIN sensitive, and fractional inactivation of GENENOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN showed equivalent increments in the reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis and phasic contractile response, suggesting that both responses are linearly related to the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive receptor sites. The Schild plots for the competitive antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN against GENEIN-selective agonist CHEMICALIN-induced contraction were linear and had slopes not significantly different from unity, with a pA2 of 9.07 +/- 0.07 (n = 5) for CHEMICALIN and 9.09 +/- 0.05 (n = 3) for CHEMICALIN. However, the Schilod plots for these antagonists against CHEMICALNOTIN were curvilinear. Computer-assisted analysis of these curvilinear Schild plots in a two-receptor system indicated that GENEIN populations responsible for the constrictive response are predominantly (approximately 80-90%) low affinity sites for the two antagonists (pKd approximately 8.1 for CHEMICALIN and pKd approximately 7.1 for CHEMICALIN) and a small population (approximately 10-20%) are high affinity sites (pKd approximately 9.1 for both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN), which was in good agreement with radioligand binding studies.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
19920913	CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. CHEMICALIN is an GENEIN antagonist (ERA) that was recently approved for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a potent vasoconstrictor with mitogenic, hypertrophic and pro-inflammatory properties that is upregulated in pulmonary hypertensive diseases. The biologic effects of GENENOTIN are mediated by 2 cell surface receptors termed GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN mediates the vasoconstrictor effect of GENENOTIN on vascular smooth muscle, whereas GENENOTIN is expressed primarily on vascular endothelial cells where it induces CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis and acts to clear GENENOTIN from the circulation. CHEMICALIN is the first GENEIN selective ERA approved for use in the US. Recently published clinical trials in patients with PAH demonstrate improvement in functional capacity and pulmonary hemodynamics similar to other GENENOTIN selective and non-selective ERAs. Its once daily dosing and lower incidence of serum GENENOTIN elevation offer potential advantages over other ERAs, but further experience with this agent is needed to fully understand its long-term efficacy and safety. This review discusses the GENENOTIN family of proteins and receptors and their role in the pathophysiology of pulmonary hypertensive diseases. It also examines the development process, safety profile and clinical trials that have resulted in CHEMICALNOTIN being approved for treatment of PAH.
19952416	Design, synthesis, and in-vivo evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN as novel nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug. A series of CHEMICALNOTIN analogs were designed and the interaction between CHEMICALIN and GENEIN studied by the docking method to improve the biological activity and reduce the gastrointestinal side effects of CHEMICALNOTIN. Finally, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), the best candidate, was selected for synthesis and bioassay based on the screening result. CHEMICALNOTIN could lower the tumefaction rates of back metatarsus in rats, as well as reduce the writhing times in mice. CHEMICALNOTIN produced fewer gastric lesions than CHEMICALNOTIN. After the CHEMICALNOTIN group was introduced into the CHEMICALNOTIN ring of CHEMICALNOTIN, its analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities remained unchanged, and it reduced the number of gastric lesions. This provided a feasible method for further structure modification and optimization of CHEMICALNOTIN.
19962254	Breast cancer and CHEMICALNOTIN metabolizing enzymes: the role of CHEMICALNOTIN. It is well documented that breast tissue, both normal and cancerous, contains all the enzymatic systems necessary for the bioformation and metabolic transformation of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. These include GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The control of these enzymes plays an important role in the development and pathogenesis of hormone-dependent breast cancer. As discussed in this review, various CHEMICALIN including CHEMICALIN and its 20alpha-dihydro-derivative, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN can reduce intratissular levels of CHEMICALIN in breast cancer by blocking GENEIN and GENEIN activities. A possible correlation has been postulated between breast cell proliferation and GENENOTIN activity. CHEMICALNOTIN is largely transformed in the breast; normal breast produces mainly 4-ene derivatives, whereas 5alpha-derivatives are most common in breast cancer tissue. It has been suggested that this specific conversion of CHEMICALNOTIN may be involved in breast carcinogenesis. In conclusion, treatment with anti-aromatases combined with anti-GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN could provide new therapeutic possibilities in the treatment of patients with hormone-dependent breast cancer.
20022821	Mechanism of right precordial ST-segment elevation in structural heart disease: excitation failure by current-to-load mismatch. BACKGROUND: The Brugada sign has been associated with mutations in SCN5A and with right ventricular structural abnormalities. Their role in the Brugada sign and the associated ventricular arrhythmias is unknown. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to delineate the role of structural abnormalities and sodium channel dysfunction in the Brugada sign. METHODS: Activation and repolarization characteristics of the explanted heart of a patient with a loss-of-function mutation in SCN5A (G752R) and dilated cardiomyopathy were determined after induction of right-sided ST-segment elevation by ajmaline. In addition, right ventricular structural discontinuities and sodium channel dysfunction were simulated in a computer model encompassing the heart and thorax. RESULTS: In the explanted heart, disappearance of local activation in unipolar electrograms at the basal right ventricular epicardium was followed by monophasic ST-segment elevation. The local origin of this phenomenon was confirmed by coaxial electrograms. Neither early repolarization nor late activation correlated with ST-segment elevation. At sites of local ST-segment elevation, the subepicardium was interspersed with adipose tissue and contained more fibrous tissue than either the left ventricle or control hearts. In computer simulations entailing right ventricular structural discontinuities, reduction of sodium channel conductance or size of the gaps between introduced barriers resulted in subepicardial excitation failure or delayed activation by current-to-load mismatch and in the Brugada sign on the ECG. CONCLUSION: Right ventricular excitation failure and activation delay by current-to-load mismatch in the subepicardium can cause the Brugada sign. Therefore, current-to-load mismatch may underlie the ventricular arrhythmias in patients with the Brugada sign.
20025554	Combination therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients on hemodialysis. OBJECTIVE: CHEMICALIN, a rapid- and short-acting insulinotropic GENEIN ligand, exhibits hypoglycemic action unlike other CHEMICALIN. The efficacy of the combination of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitors for diabetic patients on hemodialysis (HD) has not been prospectively evaluated; therefore, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of CHEMICALNOTIN in these patients. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an open-label randomized study with 36 type 2 diabetics with poor glycemic control on HD and receiving daily doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.9 mg). The patients were randomly assigned to two groups: a combination-therapy group (CHEMICALNOTIN group), CHEMICALNOTIN initial dose 7.5 - 15 mg titrated to 30 mg daily and constant daily dose 0.9 mg of CHEMICALNOTIN, and a monotherapy group (control group), constant daily dose 0.9 mg of CHEMICALNOTIN alone. The efficacy of the treatment was determined by monitoring plasma CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) levels and using homeostasis model assessment of GENENOTIN resistance (HOMA-IR). Safety and tolerance were determined by monitoring clinical and laboratory parameters. RESULTS: The final dose of CHEMICALNOTIN was 22.9 +/- 8.9 (mean +/- s.d.) mg (0.41 mg/kg) daily. CHEMICALIN reduced fasting plasma CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN levels after 4 weeks and GENEIN levels after 8 weeks. CHEMICALNOTIN levels and HOMA-IR values also decreased significantly after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. No significant changes in blood pressure levels or serious adverse effects such as hypoglycemia or liver impairment were observed. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests a combination therapy of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN may have potential for the treatment of diabetics on HD. Due to the small sample size used, further studies should be performed, particularly to assess the safety of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment.
20083608	A fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based GENENOTIN sensor reveals rapid kinetics of allosteric modulation. Allosteric modulators have been identified for several GENENOTIN, most notably GENENOTIN. To study their mechanism of action, we made use of a recently developed technique to generate fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based sensors to monitor GENENOTIN activation. Cyan fluorescent protein was fused to the CHEMICALIN terminus of the GENEIN, and a specific binding sequence for the small fluorescent compound CHEMICALIN arsenical hairpin binder, FlAsH, was inserted into the third intracellular loop; the latter site was labeled in intact cells by incubation with FlAsH. We then measured FRET between the donor cyan fluorescent protein and the acceptor FlAsH in intact cells and monitored its changes in real time. Agonists such as CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN induced rapid changes in FRET, indicative of agonist-induced conformational changes. Removal of the agonists or addition of an antagonist caused a reversal of this signal with rate constants between 400 and 1100 ms. The allosteric ligands CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN caused no changes in FRET when given alone, but increased FRET when given in the presence of an agonist, compatible with an inactivation of the receptors. The kinetics of these effects were very rapid, with rate constants of 80-100 ms and approximately 200 ms for saturating concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. Because these speeds are significantly faster than the responses to antagonists, these data indicate that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are allosteric ligands and actively induce a conformation of the GENEIN with a reduced affinity for its agonists.
20089905	A molecular mechanism for CHEMICALIN-mediated GENEIN inhibition in neurons. CHEMICALIN is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain and inflammation in many disorders via inhibition of GENEIN. Recently, we have demonstrated that CHEMICALIN inhibits intracellular signaling of GENEIN and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition, another study suggests that CHEMICALIN reduces generation of GENEIN peptide via inactivation of GENEIN signaling, although it may also regulate GENEIN formation by direct inhibition of the GENEIN. The molecular mechanisms by which CHEMICALIN inhibits the GENEIN signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that the transcription factor GENEIN (GENEIN) is essential for coupling CHEMICALIN to GENEIN inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN in neuron-like PC12 and B104 cells. Activation of GENENOTIN with traditional agonists mimics the GENEIN-inhibiting properties of CHEMICALIN in PC12 cells and, like CHEMICALNOTIN, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. Protein knockdown with small interfering RNA specific for GENENOTIN blocks GENENOTIN suppression of GENENOTIN agonists in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective GENEIN inhibition. These findings support that GENEIN plays an essential role in mediating the GENEIN-inhibiting effect of CHEMICALIN. Elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking CHEMICALIN to GENEIN inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by GENENOTIN activation, including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease.
20135071	Comparative efficacy and safety of the novel oral anticoagulants CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in preclinical and clinical development. Therapeutic oral anticoagulation is still commonly achieved by administration of CHEMICALNOTIN or other CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists that are associated with an untoward pharmacokinetic / pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) profile leading to a high incidence of bleeding complications or therapeutic failure. Hence, there is an unmet medical need of novel easy-to-use oral anticoagulants with improved efficacy and safety. Recent developments include the identification of non-peptidic small-molecules that selectively inhibit certain GENENOTIN within the coagulation cascade. Of these, the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN and GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN have recently been licensed for thromboprophylaxis after orthopaedic surgery mainly in Europe. In addition, the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN is in late-stage clinical development. Each drug is prescribed at fixed doses without the need of anticoagulant monitoring. Phase III trials in orthopaedic patients essentially resulted in non-inferior efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN and superior efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN over enoxaparin without any marked differences of drug safety, while CHEMICALNOTIN data is still controversial. However, alterations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacokinetics upon interactions with inhibitors and inducers of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN may complicate the use of these compounds in daily practice, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN elimination largely depends on renal function. Hence, this review reports PK/PD, efficacy and safety data of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN throughout preclinical and clinical development.
20184869	CHEMICALIN directly inhibits GENEIN activity in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis therapy. BACKGROUND: GENENOTIN plays an important role in tissue remodeling related to inflammation during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy. But its inhibitors were not applied clinically. We determined whether an GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, inhibits GENENOTIN activity in peritoneal effluents from patients on CAPD, and simulated molecular models of the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN complex. METHODS: The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activity was measured in peritoneal effluents from 17 patients on CAPD. Molecular models of the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN complex were simulated by 1000 iterations of random docking and energy minimization. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN directly inhibited GENEIN activity in peritoneal effluents from patients on CAPD (IC50; 48 micromol/l), and that CHEMICALIN binding to the GENEIN active site could be formed in each complex model without molecular distortion. CONCLUSION: GENEIN inhibitors, such as CHEMICALIN, may be applied as important compounds for GENEIN inhibition in inflammation caused by CAPD.
20188727	CHEMICALIN has a direct inhibitory effect on the GENEIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, are used in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus, as well as being routinely used in studies investigating GENENOTIN activity. We used the patch-clamp technique and CHEMICALNOTIN flux assays to determine the role of these drugs in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) regulation in cell lines expressing the cloned components of GENENOTIN and the current natively expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). CHEMICALIN but not CHEMICALIN inhibits a number of variants of GENEIN including the cloned equivalents of currents present in vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle (GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN) and pancreatic beta-cells (GENEIN/GENEIN). However it does not inhibit the current potentially present in cardiac myocytes (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN). The highest affinity interaction is seen with GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN (IC50=0.55 mM) and it also inhibits the current in native vascular smooth muscle cells. The extent and rate of inhibition are similar to that seen with the known GENEIN blocker CHEMICALIN. Additionally, CHEMICALIN inhibited the current elicited through the GENEIN (functional without GENEIN) channel with an IC50 of 1.78 mM. CHEMICALIN reduced the open probability of GENEIN/GENEIN channels by approximately 90% in inside-out patches. These findings suggest that CHEMICALIN interacts directly with the pore-forming GENEIN subunit however the GENEIN is able to significantly modulate the affinity. It is likely to block from the intracellular side of the channel in a manner analogous to that of CHEMICALNOTIN.
20204178	Comparison of the pharmacological effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the factors involved in mineral homeostasis. GENENOTIN agonists (VDRAs) directly suppress GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mRNA expression. Different VDRAs are known to have differential effects on serum CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which may also affect serum GENENOTIN levels since serum CHEMICALIN regulates GENEIN secretion mediated by the GENEIN (GENEIN). In this study, we compared the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on regulating serum CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN, and also the expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA. The 5/6 nephrectomized (NX) Sprague-Dawley rats on a normal or hyperphosphatemia-inducing diet were treated with vehicle, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN for two weeks. Both drugs at the tested doses (0.042-0.33 mug/kg) suppressed GENEIN mRNA expression and serum GENEIN effectively in the 5/6 NX rats, but CHEMICALIN was less potent in raising serum CHEMICALNOTIN than CHEMICALIN. In pig parathyroid cells, CHEMICALIN and the active form of CHEMICALIN induced GENEIN translocation from the cytoplasm into the nucleus, suppressed GENEIN mRNA expression and inhibited cell proliferation in a similar manner, although CHEMICALIN induced the expression of GENEIN mRNA more effectively. The multiple effects of VDRAs on modulating serum CHEMICALNOTIN, parathyroid cell proliferation, and the expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA reflect the complex involvement of the CHEMICALNOTIN axis in regulating the mineral homeostasis system.
20223979	Identification of a primary target of CHEMICALNOTIN teratogenicity. Half a century ago, CHEMICALNOTIN was widely prescribed to pregnant women as a sedative but was found to be teratogenic, causing multiple birth defects. Today, CHEMICALNOTIN is still used in the treatment of leprosy and multiple myeloma, although how it causes limb malformation and other developmental defects is unknown. Here, we identified GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN forms an GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN that is important for limb outgrowth and expression of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in zebrafish and chicks. CHEMICALIN initiates its teratogenic effects by binding to GENEIN and inhibiting the associated GENEIN activity. This study reveals a basis for CHEMICALNOTIN teratogenicity and may contribute to the development of new CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives without teratogenic activity.
20371872	A dilated cardiomyopathy troponin C mutation lowers contractile force by reducing strong myosin-actin binding. In this study we explore the mechanisms by which a double mutation (E59D/D75Y) in cardiac troponin C (CTnC) associated with dilated cardiomyopathy reduces the Ca(2+)-activated maximal tension of cardiac muscle. Studying the single mutants (i.e. E59D or D75Y) indicates that D75Y, but not E59D, causes a reduction in the calcium affinity of CTnC in troponin complex, regulated thin filaments (RTF), and the Ca(2+) sensitivity of contraction and ATPase in cardiac muscle preparations. However, both D75Y and E59D are required to reduce the actomyosin ATPase activity and maximal force in muscle fibers, indicating that E59D enhances the effects of D75Y. Part of the reduction in force/ATPase may be due to a defect in the interactions between CTnC and cardiac troponin T, which are known to be necessary for ATPase activation. An additional mechanism for the reduction in force/ATPase comes from measurements of the binding stoichiometry of myosin subfragment-1 (S-1) to the RTF. Using wild type RTFs, 4.8 mol S-1 was bound per mol filament (seven actins), whereas with E59D/D75Y RTFs, the number of binding sites was reduced by approximately 23% to 3.7. Altogether, these results suggest that the reduction in force and ATPase activation is possibly due to a thin filament conformation that promotes fewer accessible S-1-binding sites. In the absence of any family segregation data, the functional results presented here support the concept that this is likely a dilated cardiomyopathy-causing mutation.
20407761	Zolmitriptan and human aggression: interaction with alcohol. RATIONALE: The serotonin 1(B/D) (5-HT1(B/D)) receptor has shown potential as a target for decreasing aggression. The 5-HT1(B/D) agonist zolmitriptan's ability to reduce aggressive behavior in humans and its interaction with the well-known aggression-enhancing drug alcohol were examined. OBJECTIVES: Our objective was to investigate zolmitriptan's potential to modify human aggression in a laboratory paradigm across a range of alcohol doses. Alcohol has been consistently associated with aggression and violence, thus we hoped to expand current understanding of alcohol's role in aggressive behavior via manipulation of the serotonin (5-HT) system. METHODS: Eleven social drinkers, seven male, were recruited to participate in a research study lasting 3-4 weeks. Aggression was measured using the point-subtraction aggression paradigm (PSAP), a laboratory model widely used in human aggression studies. Subjects were administered 5-mg zolmitriptan and placebo capsules along with alcohol doses of 0.0, 0.4 and 0.8 g/kg in a within-subject, counterbalanced dosing design. Data were analyzed as the ratio of aggressive/monetary-earning responses, to account for possible changes in overall motor function due to alcohol. RESULTS: There was a significant alcohol by zolmitriptan interaction on the aggressive/monetary response ratio. Specifically, compared to placebo, zolmitriptan decreased the aggressive/monetary ratio at the 0.4- and 0.8-g/kg alcohol doses. CONCLUSIONS: A 5-mg dose of zolmitriptan effectively reduced alcohol-related aggression in an acute dosing protocol, demonstrating an interaction of 5-HT and alcohol in human aggressive behavior.
20448797	New standards in hypertension and cardiovascular risk management: focus on CHEMICALNOTIN. Blockade of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN system is an important approach in managing high blood pressure, and has increasingly been shown to affect cardiovascular disease processes mediated by GENENOTIN throughout the cardiovascular and renal continua. CHEMICALIN is an GENEIN blocker (ARB) displaying unique pharmacologic properties, including a longer half life than any other ARB, that result in large and sustained reductions of blood pressure. In patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension, CHEMICALNOTIN has proved superior to other antihypertensive agents (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN) in controlling blood pressure particularly towards the end of the dosing interval. There is also clinical evidence that CHEMICALNOTIN reduces left ventricular hypertrophy, reduces arterial stiffness and the recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and confers renoprotection. The ONgoing CHEMICALNOTIN Alone and in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN Global Endpoint Trial (ONTARGET) study has demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN has similar cardiovascular protective effects to CHEMICALNOTIN in a large, high-risk patient population but was better tolerated. The powerful and sustained blood pressure control apparent in clinical trials, together with cardiovascular protection and tolerability demonstrated in ONTARGET means that CHEMICALNOTIN may be a preferred option for patients with hypertension.
20512796	Jostling for position: optimizing linker location in the design of GENENOTIN-targeting PROTACs. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) antagonists have been widely used for breast cancer therapy. Despite initial responsiveness, hormone-sensitive GENENOTIN-positive cancer cells eventually develop resistance to GENENOTIN antagonists. It has been shown that in most of these resistant tumor cells, the GENENOTIN is expressed and continues to regulate tumor growth. Recent studies indicate that CHEMICALIN initially acts as an antagonist, but later functions as an GENEIN agonist, promoting tumor growth. This suggests that targeted GENENOTIN degradation may provide an effective therapeutic approach for breast cancers, even those that are resistant to conventional therapies. With this in mind, we previously demonstrated that proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) effectively induce degradation of the GENENOTIN as a proof-of-concept experiment. Herein we further refined the PROTAC approach to target the GENENOTIN for degradation. The GENEIN-targeting PROTACs are composed of an CHEMICALIN on one end and a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-derived synthetic pentapeptide on the other. The pentapeptide is recognized by an GENENOTIN called the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), thereby recruiting the GENENOTIN to this GENENOTIN for ubiquitination and degradation. Specifically, the pentapeptide is attached at three different locations on CHEMICALNOTIN to generate three different PROTAC types. With the pentapeptide linked through the C7alpha position of CHEMICALIN, the resulting PROTAC shows the most effective GENEIN degradation and highest affinity for the GENEIN. This result provides an opportunity to develop a novel type of GENENOTIN antagonist that may overcome the resistance of breast tumors to conventional drugs such as CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN).
20589617	C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene does not affect folic acid, vitamin B12, and homocysteine serum levels in Turkish children with neural tube defects. Association between neural tube defects (NTDs) and C677T polymorphism of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene was suspected, because the MTHFR gene codes for a key enzyme in folate metabolism. Its deficiency usually leads to significant reductions in plasma concentrations of folate, vitamin B(12) and methionine, whereas homocysteine levels are increased. We examined folate, vitamin B(12) and homocysteine serum concentrations and polymorphism of the C677T MTHFR gene in Turkish children with neural tube defects. Thirty-three children with NTDs, 26 mothers and 48 healthy individuals were studied. C677T MTHFR polymorphism was determined by melting curve analyses (LightCycler). The levels of folate, vitamin B(12) and homocysteine serum concentrations in NTDs were evaluated and compared, along with information concerning alleles of the MTHFR gene. C677T allele frequencies in NTD children and their mothers were similar to those found in controls. Serum folate and vitamin B(12) concentrations were significantly higher in NTD children than that of controls. Serum homocysteine concentrations were not significantly higher in NTD children and mothers. We concluded that C677T MTHFR gene polymorphism does not affect folic acid, vitamin B(12) and homocysteine metabolism in Turkish children with NTDs. C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene cannot be regarded as a major risk factor for NTDs in Turkish children.
20590599	The selectivity of GENENOTIN agonists at GENENOTIN. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There are two important properties of receptor-ligand interactions: affinity (the ability of the ligand to bind to the receptor) and efficacy (the ability of the receptor-ligand complex to induce a response). Ligands are classified as agonists or antagonists depending on whether or not they have efficacy. In theory, it is possible to develop selective agonists based on selective affinity, selective intrinsic efficacy or both. This study examined the affinity and intrinsic efficacy of 31 GENENOTIN agonists at the three GENENOTIN to determine whether the current agonists are subtype selective because of affinity or intrinsic efficacy. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Stable clonal CHO-K1 cell lines, transfected with either the GENENOTIN, were used, and whole-cell CHEMICALNOTIN radioligand binding and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation were measured. KEY RESULTS: Several agonists were found to be highly subtype selective because of selective affinity (e.g. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, for the GENEIN over the GENEIN or GENEIN), while others (e.g. CHEMICALIN) had little affinity-selectivity. However, the intrinsic efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was similar across all three receptor subtypes. Other ligands (e.g. CHEMICALIN for GENEIN; CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN for GENEIN) were found to have subtype-selective intrinsic efficacy. Several ligands appeared to activate two agonist conformations of the GENENOTIN. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: There are agonists with subtype selectivity based upon both selective affinity and selective intrinsic efficacy. Therefore, there is scope to develop better selective agonists based upon both selective affinity and selective intrinsic efficacy.
20600573	CHEMICALIN: a novel anti-Parkinsonian GENEIN inhibitor with neuroprotective activity. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a novel, highly potent irreversible GENEIN inhibitor, anti-Parkinsonian drug. CHEMICALNOTIN is effective as monotherapy or adjunct to CHEMICALNOTIN for patients with early and late Parkinson's disease (PD). Its S-isomer, CHEMICALIN is thousand times less potent as an GENEIN inhibitor. However, both compounds have similar molecular mechanisms of neuroprotection in neuronal cell cultures and animal neurodegenerative models, indicating that the neuroprotective effect of CHEMICALIN does not depend on inhibition of GENEIN, but rather is associated with the CHEMICALIN moiety, which promotes mitochondrial viability and stabilizes permeability transition by regulating GENEIN family proteins. Novel findings demonstrated that the major metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN has antioxidant and neuroprotective capabilities and thus, may contribute to the overt activity of its parent compound, CHEMICALNOTIN. This paper will review the earlier and present studies in the development of CHEMICALNOTIN for treatment of PD and discuss its pharmacology and applicable mechanism of action.
20615127	Resistance to thyroid hormone due to a novel GENENOTIN mutant in a patient with hypothyroidism secondary to lingual thyroid and functional characterization of the mutant receptor. BACKGROUND: We describe a rare case of congenital hypothyroidism and an extremely high serum GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) level caused by a combination of resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH) and a lingual thyroid. As the RTH mutant, GENENOTIN, was new, the optimum dose of CHEMICALNOTIN was unclear. To aid in assessment of the therapy, we characterized the mutant GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and compared it with a common mutant, GENENOTIN, using in vitro studies. SUMMARY: The patient was a newborn female having severe hypothyroidism with a free CHEMICALNOTIN level of 0.36 ng/dL and a serum GENENOTIN level of 177 microU/mL. A scintiscan showed ectopic lingual thyroid tissue without a normal thyroid gland. Supplementation with CHEMICALIN at a dose of >350 microg/day did not normalize the serum GENEIN level; however, the patient showed normal growth and intelligence at 14 years of age. Consistent with the results of a computer analysis, the binding of GENEIN to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) was significantly decreased to 38% that of the wild type. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay demonstrated that like GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN did not form a homodimer, but formed a heterodimer with GENENOTIN. However, a CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN-transferase pull-down assay showed reduced binding of GENEIN with GENEIN in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN and impaired release in the presence of CHEMICALIN. In addition, transient transfection experiments demonstrated that unlike GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN had severe impairment of transcriptional activity on genes both positively and negatively regulated by thyroid hormone. It also had a clear dominant negative effect on genes negatively, but not positively, regulated by thyroid hormone, including the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first reported case of a GENENOTIN GENENOTIN mutation. The characteristics of the GENENOTIN mutant differed from those of the GENENOTIN mutant. Our findings suggest that GENENOTIN causes reduced association with and impaired release of GENENOTIN, resulting in RTH predominantly at the pituitary level, and that slightly elevated serum GENEIN level with high dose of CHEMICALIN might be optimum for normal growth.
20624420	Identification of neuronal target areas for nerve agents and specification of receptors for pharmacological treatment. In order to shorten the list of candidate drugs with anticonvulsant potential against nerve agents, critical subreceptors in seizure controlling brain regions should be specified. Epileptiform activity does not spread randomly throughout the brain, but appears to be generated and propagated by specific anatomical routes. Nerve agents evoke seizure activity in the forebrain that progresses to the hind brain resulting in tonic-clonic convulsions. In some recent studies, it was shown that lesion of the area tempestas (AT), medial septum (MS), perirhinal cortex (PRC), or posterior piriform cortex (PPC) produces anticonvulsant effects (prevention of convulsions or delayed onset of convulsions) in rats exposed to soman, whereas damage to nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis magnocellularis, amygdala, hippocampus, or entorhinal cortex does not cause anticonvulsant impact. These results are in compliance with findings that seizures can be generated in AT, MS, PRC, and PPC by means of nerve agents, chemoconvulsants, or kindling. Results from microinfusion studies show that anticonvulsant efficacy is obtained by GABA(A) modulators or cholinergic antagonists (M1-M5) in AT, cholinergic antagonists (M1-M5) in MS, combined glutamatergic (NMDA) and cholinergic antagonist (M1-M4), AMPA antagonist, or modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR5, mGluR2/3) in PRC, and cholinergic antagonist (M1-M5) or GABA(A) agonist in PPC. Calculation of impact factors for the most potent drugs (percentage of positive effects in the seizure controlling sites) showed that scopolamine and procyclidine were ranking highest (75) followed by muscimol (50), NBQX (33), and caramiphen (33). Potential strategies for prophylactic and post-exposure treatments are discussed.
20724158	Selective GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors and breast cancer risk. BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiologic and laboratory studies have suggested that non-CHEMICALIN anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may reduce the risk of breast cancer through inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN). METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to measure the association between selective GENEIN inhibitors, particularly CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and non-specific NSAID subgroups, and breast cancer risk. Between 2003 and 2006, a total of 18,368 incident breast cancer cases were identified in the Ingenix/Lab Rx insurance database, which contains clinical encounter and drug prescription data. Four controls per case were randomly selected, matched on age and time in database. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: Breast cancer risk was inversely associated with both non-specific NSAID and selective GENENOTIN inhibitor use. Greater than 12 months' duration of use of CHEMICALNOTIN at a standard dose (200mg/day) was associated with a 16% decrease in breast cancer risk (OR=0.84, 95% CI=0.73, 0.97). We observed the greatest risk reduction in association with >2 years of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure (OR=0.54, 95% CI=0.37, 0.80). CHEMICALNOTIN, a compound with less biological plausibility for chemoprevention, showed no significant association with the risk of developing breast cancer. CONCLUSION: Consistent with animal models and laboratory investigations, higher doses of selective GENENOTIN inhibitors were more protective against breast cancer than non-specific NSAIDs. With exposure to CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN inhibitor, breast cancer risk reduction was appreciable (46%), suggesting a possible role for selective GENEIN inhibitors in breast cancer prophylaxis.
2087492	Barrel rotation in rats induced by CHEMICALNOTIN: suppression by CHEMICALNOTIN. Intracerebroventricular administration of CHEMICALIN (5 micrograms/rat), a GENEIN analogue, induced barrel rotation in rats. Pretreatment with CHEMICALIN (40 micrograms/100 g b. wt., IP) 3 days or 7 days prior to the injection of CHEMICALNOTIN significantly inhibited the response rate of barrel rotation induced by CHEMICALNOTIN, but not that induced by GENEIN (1 microgram/rat, ICV). The suppressive effect of CHEMICALIN on barrel rotation could be partially countered by CHEMICALIN, a selective peripheral GENEIN GENEIN antagonist. Desulfated cerulein did not affect the barrel rotation induced by CHEMICALNOTIN. These findings suggest that CHEMICALIN specifically suppresses the barrel rotation evoked by CHEMICALIN in a long-lasting manner possibly acting through GENEIN.
21058326	Effects of the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN on rat fetal palate development. BACKGROUND: The effects of GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN on rat palate development were characterized following in utero exposure. METHODS: To identify the optimum dose for inducing cleft palate, pregnant rats were administered 30, 60, or 90 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN on Gestation Days 11 to 14. Fetal palate gene expression was also assessed after 90 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN at 8, 15 and 30 hours post-dose on Gestation Day 14 using microarray and qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Rats in the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups exhibited adverse clinical signs and body weight loss. Rats in the 90-mg/kg group also demonstrated increases in late resorptions and decreases in fetal weight. Effects in the low-dose group were limited to decreases in body weight gain. Fetal assessment on Gestation Day 21 revealed that findings were limited to the 60- and 90-mg/kg groups, and included cleft palate (80% of litters for both groups), high arched palate, small nose, micrognathia, high domed head, digits shortened/absent and small limb. The fetal incidence of cleft palate was higher at 90 mg/kg, thus this dose was selected to assess palate gene expression. The altered genes associated with CHEMICALIN-induced cleft palate included GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN but the magnitude of the change was relatively small (1.5- to 2-fold). CONCLUSIONS: Expression of several genes involved in palate, limb and digit development was altered in the fetal palate following in utero exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN. The subtle perturbation and interplay of these genes may have profound effects on the dynamics of fetal palate development.
21194017	GENENOTIN as molecular targets of general anesthetics: identification of binding sites provides clues to allosteric modulation. PURPOSE: The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge of detailed biochemical evidence for the role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in the mechanisms of general anesthesia. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: With the knowledge that all general anesthetics positively modulate GENEIN-mediated inhibitory transmission, site-directed mutagenesis comparing sequences of GENEIN subunits of varying sensitivity led to identification of CHEMICALIN residues in the transmembrane domain that are critical for the drug actions in vitro. Using a photo incorporable analogue of the general anesthetic, CHEMICALIN, we identified two transmembrane CHEMICALIN that were affinity labelled in purified GENEIN. Homology protein structural modelling positions these two residues, alphaM1-11' and betaM3-4', close to each other in a single type of GENENOTIN at the GENENOTIN. This position would be appropriate for modulation of agonist channel gating. Overall, available information suggests that these two CHEMICALNOTIN binding residues are allosterically coupled to sites of action of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, volatile agents, and CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN. Residue alpha/betaM2-15' is probably not a binding site but allosterically coupled to action of volatile agents, CHEMICALNOTIN, and intravenous agents, and alpha/betaM1-(-2') is coupled to action of intravenous agents. CONCLUSIONS: Establishment of a coherent and consistent structural model of the GENENOTIN lends support to the conclusion that general anesthetics can modulate function by binding to appropriate domains on the protein. Genetic engineering of mice with mutation in some of these GENENOTIN residues are insensitive to general anesthetics in vivo, suggesting that further analysis of these domains could lead to development of more potent and specific drugs.
2120879	Role of extracellular CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN in GENEIN secretion induced by hyposmolarity, GENENOTIN, and high CHEMICALNOTIN in GH4C1 cells. The mechanism by which 30% medium hyposmolarity induces GENENOTIN secretion by GH4C1 cells was compared with that induced by 100 nmol/l GENENOTIN or 30 mmol/l CHEMICALNOTIN. Removing medium CHEMICALNOTIN, blocking GENEIN with 50 mumol/l CHEMICALIN, or inhibiting GENEIN activation with 20 mumol/l CHEMICALIN, 10 mumol/l CHEMICALIN or 10 mumol/l CHEMICALIN almost completely blocked hyposmolarity-induced secretion. The smooth muscle relaxant, CHEMICALIN, which is believed relatively specific in inhibiting the CHEMICALIN-GENEIN interaction, depressed hyposmolarity-induced GENEIN secretion in a dose-dependent manner (r = -0.991, p less than 0.01). The above drugs also blocked or decreased high CHEMICALNOTIN-induced secretion, but had much less effect on GENENOTIN-induced secretion. Secretion induced by GENENOTIN, hyposmolarity, or high CHEMICALNOTIN was optimal at pH 7.3-7.65 and was significantly depressed at pH 6.0 or 8.0, indicating that release of hormone induced by all 3 stimuli is due to an active cell process requiring a physiologic extracellular pH and is not produced by nonspecific cell toxicity. The data suggest hyposmolarity and high CHEMICALNOTIN may share some similarities in their mechanism of stimulating secretion, which is different from that of GENENOTIN.
21318872	Use of (Gyro) Gy and GENENOTIN transgenic mice to study functions of CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN are essential for mammalian cell growth, -differentiation, and cell death and have important physiological roles in all tissues. Many of the properties of CHEMICALNOTIN that can be demonstrated in vitro are common to all three molecules with differences only in potency. Loss of any of the enzymes needed to make either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (which also -prevent the production of CHEMICALNOTIN) is lethal, but male mice lacking GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) due to a deletion of part of the X chromosome are viable on the B6C3H background. These mice are termed Gyro (Gy) due to their circling behavior. They have a variety of abnormalities including deafness, neurological problems, small size, and a tendency to early death. They can therefore be used to evaluate the physiological function(s) uniquely provided by CHEMICALNOTIN. They also provide a potential animal model for Snyder-Robinson syndrome (SRS), a rare human inherited disease due to a loss of GENENOTIN activity. An essential control in experiments using Gy mice is to demonstrate that the abnormal phenotypes exhibited by these mice are abolished by providing replacement CHEMICALIN and this can be accomplished by breeding with CAG-GENEIN mice that express GENEIN from a ubiquitous promoter. Techniques for identifying, characterizing, and using these mouse strains and limitations of this approach are described in this chapter.
21926191	CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a novel GENEIN and GENEIN inhibitor, simultaneously suppresses metastasis, angiogenesis, and tumor growth. The signaling pathway of the GENENOTIN and its ligand GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is important for cell growth, survival, and motility and is functionally linked to the signaling pathway of GENENOTIN, which is widely recognized as a key effector in angiogenesis and cancer progression. Dysregulation of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN axis is found in a number of human malignancies and has been associated with tumorigenesis. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a small-molecule GENEIN inhibitor with potent activity toward GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN), as well as a number of other GENEIN that have also been implicated in tumor pathobiology, including GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. Treatment with CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN and GENEIN phosphorylation in vitro and in tumor models in vivo and led to significant reductions in cell invasion in vitro. In mouse models, CHEMICALNOTIN dramatically altered tumor pathology, resulting in decreased tumor and endothelial cell proliferation coupled with increased apoptosis and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth in breast, lung, and glioma tumor models. Importantly, treatment with CHEMICALIN did not increase lung tumor burden in an experimental model of metastasis, which has been observed with inhibitors of GENEIN signaling that do not target GENEIN. Collectively, these data suggest that CHEMICALIN is a promising agent for inhibiting tumor angiogenesis and metastasis in cancers with dysregulated GENEIN and GENEIN signaling.
21955206	CHEMICALIN suppresses osteoclastogenesis induced by GENEIN and cancer cells through inhibition of inflammatory pathways: a new use for an old drug. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Most patients with cancer die not because of the tumour in the primary site, but because it has spread to other sites. Common tumours, such as breast, multiple myeloma, and prostate tumours, frequently metastasize to the bone. To search for an inhibitor of cancer-induced bone loss, we investigated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, a semi-synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN derived from the plant Gloriosa superba and clinically used as a muscle relaxant, on osteoclastogenesis induced by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and tumour cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We used RAW 264.7 (murine macrophage) cells, a well-established system for osteoclastogenesis, and evaluated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN signalling and osteoclastogenesis as well as on osteoclastogenesis induced by tumour cells. KEY RESULTS: CHEMICALIN suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by GENEIN, and by breast cancer and multiple myeloma cells. Inhibition of the GENENOTIN pathway was responsible for this effect since the CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-induced GENEIN activation, activation of GENEIN (GENEIN) and suppressed inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN) phosphorylation and degradation, an inhibitor of GENEIN. Furthermore, an inhibitor of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN gamma or GENENOTIN essential modulator, the regulatory component of the GENENOTIN complex, demonstrated that the GENENOTIN signalling pathway is mandatory for osteoclastogenesis induced by GENENOTIN. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Together, these data suggest that CHEMICALIN significantly suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by GENEIN and tumour cells via the GENEIN signalling pathway. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN, a drug that has been used for almost half a century to treat muscle pain, may also be considered as a new treatment for bone loss.
22064666	GENEIN genotypes and haplotypes modify the responses to CHEMICALIN in patients with erectile dysfunction. Erectile dysfunction (ED) is usually treated with CHEMICALNOTIN. Although genetic polymorphisms in the GENEIN (GENEIN) gene may impair endogenous CHEMICALIN formation, there is little information about how GENEIN polymorphisms and haplotypes affect the responses to CHEMICALIN. We studied 118 patients; 63 patients had ED secondary to radical prostatectomy (PED) and 55 had organic, clinical ED. GENENOTIN genotypes for three GENENOTIN polymorphisms (T(-786)C, rs2070744; a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) in intron 4; and Glu298Asp, rs1799983) were determined, and GENENOTIN haplotypes were estimated using PHASE 2.1. The clinical responses to CHEMICALNOTIN were evaluated and the patients were classified as good responders (GR) or poor responders (PR) when their changes in five-item version of International Index for Erectile Function questionnaire were above or below the median value. The TC/CC genotypes and the C allele for the T(-786)C polymorphism were more common in GR, compared with PR patients with PED. However, the 4b4a/4a4a genotypes and the 4a allele for the VNTR polymorphism in intron 4 were more common in GR, compared with PR patients with clinical ED. The C-4a-Glu haplotype was more common in GR than in PR patients with PED. Conversely, the T-4b-Asp haplotype was less common in GR than in PR patients with PED. No other significant differences were found. Our findings show evidence that GENEIN polymorphisms affect the responses of PED and clinical ED patients to CHEMICALIN.
22080037	CHEMICALIN induces the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a transcription factor that mediates the inducible expression of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses. GENENOTIN activation induces numerous proinflammatory gene products including GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The divalent heavy metal CHEMICALNOTIN has been used for thousands of years. Although CHEMICALNOTIN is clearly toxic to most mammalian organ systems, especially the immune system, exposure has still increased in some areas of the world. However, the underlying toxic mechanism is not clearly identified. Here, we report biochemical evidence that CHEMICALIN alone induces GENEIN activation, resulting in the induced expression of GENEIN and GENEIN. The results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN can induce inflammatory diseases by lowering host defense.
22381584	Pharmacological evidence of functional inhibitory GENENOTIN on mouse arousal-related cholinergic laterodorsal tegmental neurons. Cholinergic neurons of the pontine laterodorsal tegmentum (LDT) are importantly involved in neurobiological mechanisms governing states of arousal such as sleep and wakefulness as well as other appetitive behaviors, such as drug-seeking. Accordingly, mechanisms controlling their excitability are important to elucidate if we are to understand how these LDT neurons generate arousal states. CHEMICALNOTIN mediates the vast majority of excitatory synaptic transmission in the vertebrate CNS and while presence of CHEMICALNOTIN input in the LDT has been shown and ionotropic responses to CHEMICALNOTIN have been reported in the LDT, characterization of metabotropic responses is lacking. Therefore, electrophysiological responses and changes in levels of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN in mouse cholinergic LDT neurons following application of specific GENENOTIN agonists and antagonists were examined. Unexpectedly, both the GENEINspecific agonist, CHEMICALIN, and the GENEIN (GENENOTIN) agonist, CHEMICALIN (LY), induced a CHEMICALNOTIN-insensitive outward current/hyperpolarization. Both outward currents were significantly reduced by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced current was blocked by the specific GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN. Concurrent CHEMICALNOTINimaging revealed that while CHEMICALNOTIN actions did include release of CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive intracellular stores, actions of LY did not. Both CHEMICALNOTIN- and LY-induced outward currents were mediated by a CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN conductance. The large-conductance, GENENOTIN blocker, iberiotoxin, attenuated CHEMICALNOTIN actions. Consistent with actions on the BK conductance, CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced the amplitude of the fast component of the after hyperpolarizing potential, concurrent with a reduction in the firing rate. We conclude that stimulation of GENENOTIN and group II (GENENOTIN) elicits postsynaptically-mediated outward currents/hyperpolarizations in cholinergic LDT neurons. Effects of glutamatergic input would be, thus, expected not only to be excitation via stimulation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, but also inhibition via actions at GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN on these neurons. As these two processes counteract each other, these surprising findings necessitate revision of predictions regarding the net level of excitation generated by CHEMICALNOTIN input to cholinergic LDT cells and, by extension, the functional outcome of CHEMICALNOTIN transmission on processes which these neurons regulate. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'GENENOTIN'.
22391562	A potent GENENOTIN inhibitor is selectively cytotoxic in melanomas with high levels of replicative stress. There are few effective treatments for metastatic melanoma. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors are being trialled for their efficacy in enhancing conventional chemotherapeutic agents, but their effectiveness as single agents is not known. We have examined the effectiveness of two novel GENEIN selective inhibitors, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, in a panel of melanoma cell lines and normal cell types. We demonstrate that these drugs display single-agent activity, with IC50s in the low nanomolar range. The drugs produce cytotoxic effects in cell lines that are most sensitive to these drugs, whereas normal cells are only sensitive to these drugs at the higher concentrations where they have cytostatic activity. The cytotoxic effect is the consequence of inhibition of S-phase GENENOTIN, which drives cells prematurely from late S phase into an aberrant mitosis and results in either failure of cytokinesis or cell death through an apoptotic mechanism. The sensitivity to the GENENOTIN inhibitors was correlated with the level of endogenous DNA damage indicating replicative stress. GENENOTIN inhibitors are viable single-agent therapies that target melanoma cells with high levels of endogenous DNA damage. This sensitivity suggests that GENENOTIN is a critical component of an adaptation to replicative stress in these cells. It also suggests that markers of DNA damage may be useful in identifying the melanomas and potentially other tumour types that are more likely to be sensitive to GENENOTIN inhibitors as single agents.
22406476	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN signaling, activates GENEIN, and induces autophagy in colorectal cancer cells. BACKGROUND & AIMS: CHEMICALNOTIN reduces the incidence of and mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC) by unknown mechanisms. Cancer cells have defects in signaling via the GENENOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which regulates proliferation. We investigated whether CHEMICALNOTIN affects GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN signaling in CRC cells. METHODS: The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN signaling, the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were examined in CRC cells by immunoblotting. Phosphorylation of GENENOTIN was measured; the effects of loss of GENENOTIN on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were determined using small interfering RNA (siRNA) in CRC cells and in GENENOTIN-/-) mouse embryonic fibroblasts. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were used as markers of autophagy. We analyzed rectal mucosa samples from patients given 600 mg CHEMICALNOTIN, once daily for 1 week. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN reduced GENEIN signaling in CRC cells by inhibiting the GENEIN effectors GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN changed nucleotide ratios and activated GENEIN in CRC cells. GENEIN was still inhibited by CHEMICALIN in CRC cells after siRNA knockdown of GENENOTIN, indicating GENEIN-dependent and GENEIN-independent mechanisms of CHEMICALIN-induced inhibition of GENEIN. CHEMICALIN induced autophagy, a feature of GENEIN inhibition. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (an activator of GENEIN) increased inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN, as well as autophagy in CRC cells. Rectal mucosal samples from patients given CHEMICALIN had reduced phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALIN is an inhibitor of GENEIN and an activator of GENEIN, targeting regulators of intracellular energy homeostasis and metabolism. These could contribute to its protective effects against development of CRC.
22410778	Oncogenic GENEIN expression is associated with derangement of the CHEMICALNOTIN/GENEIN pathway and CHEMICALIN-reversible alterations of mitochondrial dynamics and respiration. The Warburg effect in cancer cells has been proposed to involve several mechanisms, including adaptation to hypoxia, oncogenes activation or loss of oncosuppressors and impaired mitochondrial function. In previous papers, it has been shown that GENENOTIN transformed mouse cells are much more sensitive as compared with normal cells to CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal (undergoing apoptosis) and present a high glycolytic rate and a strong reduction of GENENOTIN. Recent observations suggest that transformed cells have a derangement in the CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN) pathway, which is known to regulate several mitochondrial functions. Herein, the derangement of the CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway and its impact on transformation-linked changes of mitochondrial functions is investigated. Exogenous stimulation of GENEIN activity, achieved by CHEMICALIN treatment, protected GENEIN-transformed cells from apoptosis induced by CHEMICALIN deprivation, enhanced GENEIN activity, intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels, mitochondrial fusion and decreased intracellular reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) levels. Several of these effects were almost completely prevented by inhibiting the GENENOTIN activity. Short-time treatment with compounds favoring mitochondrial fusion strongly decreased the cellular ROS levels especially in transformed cells. These findings support the notion that CHEMICALIN shortage-induced apoptosis, specific of GENEIN-transformed cells, is associated to a derangement of GENENOTIN signaling that leads to GENENOTIN decrease, reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN formation, prevalence of mitochondrial fission over fusion, and thereby opening new approaches for development of anticancer drugs.
22422627	CHEMICALIN inhibits myofibroblast differentiation in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts via the GENEIN pathway. The purposes of this study were to determine whether CHEMICALNOTIN has any effect on phenotype changes and extracellular matrix (ECM) production in nasal polyp-derived fibroblasts (NPDFs) and to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism. NPDFs were pre-treated with CHEMICALNOTIN prior to induction by GENENOTIN. The expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN mRNA was determined by a reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, and the expression of GENENOTIN protein and GENENOTIN was determined by western blotting and/or immunofluorescent staining. The total soluble GENENOTIN production was analysed by the SirCol collagen assay. The expression of several signaling molecules of the GENENOTIN pathway was evaluated by western blot analysis. In GENEIN-induced NPDFs, CHEMICALIN significantly inhibited the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN mRNA and reduced GENEIN and GENEIN protein levels. CHEMICALIN only suppressed the expression of GENEIN among the evaluated signaling molecules. CHEMICALIN (a specific inhibitor of GENEIN GENEIN) markedly suppressed the increased expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in GENEIN-induced NPDFs. CHEMICALIN exerts suppressive effects on phenotype changes and ECM production in NPDFs via GENEIN signaling pathway interference. The findings provide new therapeutic options for ECM production in nasal polyps.
22475014	Glaucogenin E, a new C21 steroid from Cynanchum stauntonii. Glaucogenin E (1), a new C(21) steroid sapogenin, along with three known ones (2-4) were isolated from the rhizomes of Cynanchum stauntonii (Decne.) Schltr. ex Levl. Their structures were established mainly by the spectroscopic analysis, including 2D NMR. All the isolated compounds were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against human cancer cell lines HeLa, Bel-7402, SGC-7901 and BGC-823.
22493952	New triterpenoids from the stem bark of Hypodaphnis zenkeri. A new pentacyclic triterpenoid and three new derivatives based on the taraxer-14-ene skeleton with a C-28 attached a carboxylic acid group have been isolated from the stem bark of Hypodaphnis zenkeri, together with six known compounds. The new product was identified as 2α,3α-dihydroxytaraxer-14-en-28-oic acid (1). Its derivatives, 2α,3α-diacetyltaraxer-14-en-28-oic acid (2), 2α,3α-di-O-carbonyl-2α,3α-dihydroxytaraxer-14-en-28-oic acid (3) and 2α,3α-dipropionyltaraxer-14-en-28-oic acid (4) were obtained by semisynthesis. The known compounds were identified as 3β-hydroxytaraxer-14-en-28-oic acid or aleuritolic acid (5) (McPhail, A.T., McPhail, D.R., Wani, M.C., Wall, M.E. & A.W., Nicholas, A.W. (1989).

22537580	Two new C-15 enolic acyl phragmalin-type limonoids from Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina. Two new C-15 enolic acyl phragmalin-type limonoid orthoesters, chukvelutilide G (1) and chukrasine F (2), were isolated from the stem barks of Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina. Their structures were elucidated by their extensive high resolution-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS), one- and two-dimensional spectroscopic analysis, including heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC), HMBC and NOESY experiments.
22552008	GENEIN is a direct protein target for immunomodulatory and antiproliferative activities of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and the immunomodulatory drug, CHEMICALNOTIN, are therapeutically active in hematological malignancies. The ubiquitously expressed E3 ligase protein GENEIN (GENEIN) has been identified as the primary teratogenic target of CHEMICALIN. Our studies demonstrate that CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and another immunomodulatory drug, CHEMICALIN, bound endogenous GENEIN and recombinant GENEIN-GENEIN (GENEIN) complexes. GENEIN mediated antiproliferative activities of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN in myeloma cells, as well as CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN production in T cells. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited autoubiquitination of GENEIN in HEK293T cells expressing CHEMICALIN-binding competent wild-type GENEIN, but not CHEMICALIN-binding defective GENEIN(YW/AA). Overexpression of GENENOTIN wild-type protein, but not GENENOTIN(YW/AA) mutant protein, in KMS12 myeloma cells, amplified CHEMICALIN-mediated reductions in GENEIN and GENEIN expression and increases in GENEIN(GENEIN) expression. Long-term selection for CHEMICALIN resistance in H929 myeloma cell lines was accompanied by a reduction in GENEIN, while in DF15R myeloma cells resistant to both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN protein was undetectable. Our biophysical, biochemical and gene silencing studies show that GENEIN is a proximate, therapeutically important molecular target of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN.
22566187	Evaluation of food-drug interaction of guava leaf tea. Guava leaf tea (GLT) contains guava leaf CHEMICALNOTIN (Gvpp), which regulates the absorption of dietary CHEMICALNOTIN from the intestines. Borderline diabetics, who are at high risk of development of diabetes, take GLT to suppress a rapid increase of blood CHEMICALNOTIN level after meals. However, patients with diabetes in whom diabetic drugs or CHEMICALNOTIN as a blood thinner are prescribed also take GLT with the expectation of glycemic control. Therefore, we studied whether GLT had potential for inhibition or induction of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and an influence on the action of CHEMICALNOTIN. Extract of guava leaf (GvEx) consists of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, which are Gvpp, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. These CHEMICALIN, but not GvEx, showed a certain level of inhibition of human-cDNA-expressed GENEIN. In a comparison of GLT and grapefruit juice, GLT showed weaker inhibition of GENENOTIN activities and of CHEMICALNOTIN 1'-hydroxylation than grapefruit juice. Furthermore, neither liver weight nor GENENOTIN expression in the liver was changed in rats that received GvEx for 90 days compared with the control group. When rats were concomitantly treated with GLT and CHEMICALNOTIN, the prolongation of clotting time of blood by CHEMICALNOTIN was not influenced. These data suggest that GLT is unlikely to interact with drugs.
22594847	CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer. INTRODUCTION: Recent progress in identifying distinct subsets of lung cancer, based on critical driver mutations, has led to increasingly focused efforts in the development of selectively targeted therapies. The fusion oncogene, GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN), is present in approximately 5% of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors. CHEMICALIN is an oral GENEIN inhibitor (TKI), which silences the protein product of the GENEIN fusion gene and has recently been approved for the treatment of NSCLC aberrantly expressing GENEIN. Emerging data suggest that CHEMICALIN may also have activity in other subsets of lung cancer, including tumors demonstrating amplification or mutation of the GENEIN oncogene, or translocation of the GENEIN oncogene. AREAS COVERED: This paper gives an overview of the molecular pathogenesis of GENENOTIN-associated NSCLC. It also reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data on CHEMICALNOTIN and outlines the preclinical and clinical studies leading to the approval of CHEMICALNOTIN. In addition, it discusses its role in the treatment of NSCLC expressing GENENOTIN. EXPERT OPINION: CHEMICALNOTIN represents the newest example of a focused strategy for drug development in lung cancer, based on identification and targeted inhibition of critical tumor-specific driver mutations. CHEMICALIN has demonstrated efficacy against GENEIN-rearranged NSCLC, and has potential for broader application in select subsets of lung cancer.
2262902	Central adenosinergic system involvement in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced motor incoordination in mice. To clarify if the behavioral interaction between CHEMICALIN and GENEIN reported previously occur centrally or due to a peripheral hemodynamic change, the effect of i.c.v. GENEIN agonists, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, antagonists, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as well as CHEMICALIN on CHEMICALNOTIN-(i.p.)-induced motor incoordination was evaluated by rotorod. CHEMICALNOTIN agonists and antagonists dose dependently accentuated and attenuated, respectively, CHEMICALNOTIN-induced motor incoordination, thereby suggesting a central mechanism of GENEIN modulation of this effect of CHEMICALIN and confirmed our previous reports in which CHEMICALNOTIN agonists and antagonists were given i.p. CHEMICALIN, a weak GENEIN antagonist but potent inhibitor of GENEIN, did not alter ethanol's motor incoordination, further supporting involvement of brain GENEIN mechanism(s) in CHEMICALIN-GENEIN interactions. Results from R-PIA and CHEMICALIN experiments showed nearly a 40-fold greater potency of R-vs. S-diastereoisomer, suggesting predominance of GENEIN subtype. However, CHEMICALIN data indicate complexity of the mechanism(s) and point toward an additional involvement of a yet unknown subtype of GENEIN. No effect of ethanol on blood or brain levels of CHEMICALNOTIN was noted and sufficient amount of the latter entered the brain to suggest GENEIN activation adequate to produce behavioral interaction with CHEMICALIN. There was no escape of i.c.v.-administered CHEMICALNOTIN from brain to the peripheral circulation ruling out a peripheral and supporting a central mechanism of CHEMICALIN-GENEIN interaction.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
22641218	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN signal pathway cross-talk is mediated through GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in a subset of head and neck cancers. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has a dual role in epithelial malignancies, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Attenuation of canonical GENENOTIN signaling enhances de novo tumor development, whereas GENENOTIN overexpression and signaling paradoxically promotes malignant progression. We recently observed that GENENOTIN-induced growth arrest response is attenuated, in association with aberrant activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a transcription factor, which promotes malignant progression in HNSCC. However, what role cross-talk between components of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN pathways plays in altered activation of these pathways has not been established. Here, we show GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are predominantly expressed in a subset of HNSCC tumors with nuclear activation of GENENOTIN family member GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Further, GENENOTIN treatment induced sequential phosphorylation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in human HNSCC lines. GENENOTIN enhances GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN activation, as GENENOTIN siRNA knockdown decreased GENENOTIN-induced phosphorylation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, degradation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN nuclear translocation and DNA binding, and GENENOTIN-induced reporter and target gene transcription. Functionally, GENENOTIN siRNA inhibited cell proliferation, migration and invasion. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor and anti-inflammatory compound used in traditional Chinese medicine, also decreased GENEIN-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN, and suppressed basal, GENEIN- and GENEIN (GENENOTIN)-induced GENEIN reporter gene activity. CHEMICALIN also inhibited cell proliferation, while increasing sub-G0 DNA fragmentation and GENEIN markers of apoptosis. Furthermore, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activation promoted GENENOTIN expression. In turn, GENENOTIN preferentially suppressed GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN reporters when compared with constitutive or GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN reporter gene activation. Thus, cross-talk by GENENOTIN via GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN promotes the malignant phenotype of HNSCC. Moreover, GENENOTIN may contribute to the downstream attenuation of canonical GENENOTIN signaling through increased GENENOTIN expression. CHEMICALIN highlights the therapeutic potential of agents targeting GENEIN as a key node in this pro-oncogenic GENEIN-GENEIN signal pathway.
22683935	Dendritic cell migration assay: a potential prediction model for identification of contact allergens. This manuscript describes methodology and a prediction model for the MUTZ-LC migration assay. The assay represents the physiological change in Langerhans cell (LC) behavior after exposure to a sensitizing chemical, resulting in LC migration from the epidermis to the dermis. MUTZ-LC are derived from the commercially available MUTZ-3 cell line. Upon exposure to a sensitizer MUTZ-LC migrate preferentially towards CXCL12 whereas upon exposure to a non-sensitizer MUTZ-LC migrate towards CCL5. A CXCL12/CCL5 ratio >1.10 in 2/3 independent experiments is indicative of a sensitizer, whereas a CXCL12/CCL5 ratio ≤1.10 is indicative of a non-sensitizer. At non cytotoxic chemical concentrations 9 sensitizers (2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene, paraphenylendiamine, cinnamaldehyde, isoeugenol, nickel-sulfate, tetramethylthiuram disulfide, eugenol, cinnamic-alcohol, ammonium-hexachloroplatinate) were distinguished from 4 non sensitizers (sodium lauryl sulfate, salicylic acid, phenol, octanoic acid). Critical points in assay performance are (i) MUTZ-3 passage number after thawing (p6-p40); (ii) cell viability (>80%); (iii) standard curve to optimize correlation of fluorescence with cell number; and (iv) optimization of the concentration of rhCXCL12 and rhCCL5 in transwell. The protocol has been tested in three European laboratories and results suggest that it may provide working conditions for performing the DC migration assay which is aimed at distinguishing sensitizers from non sensitizers.
22708686	The atypical antidepressant CHEMICALIN exhibits agonist activity at GENEIN. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Antidepressants are known to interact with the opioid system through mechanisms not completely understood. We previously reported that CHEMICALIN antidepressants act as agonists at distinct GENEIN. Here, we investigated the effect of the atypical antidepressant CHEMICALNOTIN at cloned and native GENENOTIN. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were examined in CHO cells transfected with GENENOTIN, C6 glioma cells and rat brain membranes by the use of radioligand binding and functional assays including the stimulation of CHEMICALNOTIN binding and GENENOTIN phosphorylation. KEY RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN displayed 12- and 18-fold higher affinity for GENENOTIN respectively. In CHEMICALIN assays, CHEMICALIN selectively activated GENEIN. The agonist activity was antagonized by the selective GENEIN blocker CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). The CHEMICALIN analogue CHEMICALIN also displayed GENEIN agonist activity. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN increased GENENOTIN phosphorylation in CHO cells expressing GENEIN and C6 cells, and these effects were antagonized by CHEMICALIN. In rat striatum and nucleus accumbens, CHEMICALIN stimulated CHEMICALIN binding in a CHEMICALIN-sensitive manner with maximal effects lower than those of the full GENEIN agonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. When combined, CHEMICALIN antagonized the effects of the full GENEIN agonists in CHEMICALIN assays and reduced the stimulation of GENEIN GENEIN and GENENOTIN phosphorylation by CHEMICALIN. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In different cell systems, CHEMICALIN directly activates GENEIN, displaying partial agonist activity at brain receptors. Thus, this property appears to be a common feature of different classes of antidepressants.
22718275	Lipid biomarkers of oxidative stress in a genetic mouse model of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome. 7-Dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) accumulates in tissues and fluids of patients with Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS), which is caused by mutations in the gene encoding 3β-hydroxysterol-Δ(7)-reductase (DHCR7). We recently reported that 7-DHC is the most reactive lipid molecule toward free radical oxidation (lipid peroxidation) and 14 oxysterols have been identified as products of oxidation of 7-DHC in solution. As the high oxidizability of 7-DHC may lead to systemic oxidative stress in SLOS patients, we report here lipid biomarkers of oxidative stress in a Dhcr7-KO mouse model of SLOS, including oxysterols, isoprostanes (IsoPs), and neuroprostanes (NeuroPs) that are formed from the oxidation of 7-DHC, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, respectively. In addition to a previously described oxysterol, 3β,5α-dihydroxycholest-7-en-6-one (DHCEO), we provide evidence for the chemical structures of three new oxysterols in the brain and/or liver tissue of Dhcr7-KO mice, two of which were quantified. We find that levels of IsoPs and NeuroPs are also elevated in brain and/or liver tissues of Dhcr7-KO mice relative to matching WT mice. While IsoPs and NeuroPs have been established as a reliable measurement of lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress in vivo, we show that in this genetic SLOS mouse model, 7-DHC-derived oxysterols are present at much higher levels than IsoPs and NeuroPs and thus are better markers of lipid oxidation and related oxidative stress.
22798249	Correlation of high urinary Smad1 level with glomerular hyperfiltration in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between urinary Smad1 and glomerular hyperfiltration (GHF) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and to explore the factors related to the urinary Smad1 in T2DM. The reference value of the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was determined in 248 healthy individuals. 30 patients with GHF, 58 patients with norm-GFR T2DM, and 24 healthy patients who served as controls were recruited. Urinary Smad1, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), fasting serum C-Peptide (C-P), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1c), cystatin C, and other chemistry laboratory parameters of T2DM participants and controls were measured. Patients with GHF had higher levels of urinary Smad1 than the control group, and those with norm-GFR. For T2DM patients with body mass index, age, and gender adjustments, urinary Smad1 was positively correlated with FPG, HbA1C, and eGFR, but negatively correlated with fasting serum C-P. Multivariate linear regression analysis demonstrated that eGFR, HbA1C, and fasting serum C-P were independently associated with urinary Smad1. High levels of urinary Smad1 were found in GHF patients with T2DM, which may be another potential mechanism of GHF in relation to diabetic nephropathy.
22824191	CHEMICALNOTIN restores cognitive deficits and improves GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN pathologies in a senescence-accelerated mouse model. Ageing is associated with a deterioration of cognitive performance and with increased risk of neurodegenerative disorders. Hypertension is the most-prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, and clinical data suggest that hypertension is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we tested whether CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist commonly used as antihypertensive drug, could ameliorate the cognitive impairments and increases in AD-related markers shown by the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8). CHEMICALNOTIN administration (5 mg/kg for 3 weeks) to 6-month-old SAMP8 mice attenuated cognitive memory impairments shown by these mice in the novel object recognition test. In the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice it has been found increases in GENENOTIN levels, the principal constituent of GENENOTIN plaques observed in AD, accompanied by both an increased expression of the cleaving enzyme GENENOTIN and a decreased expression of the degrading enzyme GENENOTIN. All these effects were reversed by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. GENENOTIN hyperphosphorylation (PHF-1 epitope) shown by SAMP8 mice at this age was also decreased in the hippocampus of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated mice, an effect probably related to a decrease in GENENOTIN expression. Interestingly, CHEMICALNOTIN also phosphorylated GENENOTIN in SAMP8 mice, which was associated with an increase of GENENOTIN phosphorylation, contributing therefore to the reductions in GENENOTIN hyperphosphorylation. Synaptic pathology in SAMP8 mice, as shown by decreases in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, was also counteracted by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Overall, CHEMICALNOTIN might be beneficial in age-related brain dysfunction and could be an emerging candidate for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
22835278	Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumour in postmenopausal women: report of two cases. Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumours of the ovary are rare. We present two cases in which patients had increased blood levels of testosterone and frank hirsutism. Imaging showed minimal abnormalities. After adrenal disease had been ruled out, they underwent a bilateral oophorectomy. One case showed a Leydig cell hyperplasia, the other a Leydig cell tumour. An androgen producing tumour should be excluded in every woman with evidence of hirsutism or frank virilization and markedly elevated testosterone levels. Adrenal disease with androgen hypersecretion can be suspected by detailed clinical, laboratory and radiologic imaging. Although DHEAS has a good sensitivity in the detection of adrenal origin of hyperandrogenism (and hence a good negative predictive value) it is not specific (specificity ranging from 85 to 98%). Imaging of the ovaries can be helpful but does not rule out ovarian disease if normal. Indeed, diffuse stromal Leydig cell hyperplasia and Leydig cell tumours (usually small) may escape imaging and in some cases diagnosis can only be made on pathology. As these clinical entities represent a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge, oophorectomy should be considered in postmenopausal women with hirsutism and elevated testosterone levels, after the exclusion of adrenal causes. The procedure is relatively safe and effective. Follow-up remains indicated.
22862926	Incretin and pancreatic hormone secretion in Caucasian non-diabetic carriers of the TCF7L2 rs7903146 risk T allele. We characterised 62 non-diabetic, middle-aged, Caucasians with and without the T risk allele of rs7903146 in transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF7L2) with regard to secretion of insulin, glucagon, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) as well as insulin sensitivity and endogenous glucose production. All participants had a 3-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), an intravenous glucose tolerance test and a euglycaemic, hyperinsulinaemic clamp. After adjustment for age and sex, risk T allele carriers had higher haemoglobin A1c levels (p = 0.030), reduced first-phase insulin response (p = 0.048), higher peripheral insulin sensitivity (p = 0.050) and lower fasting GIP concentrations (p = 0.003) than CC allele carriers. The latter was also reflected by lower total GIP secretion during the OGTT (p = 0.018). We found no significant differences in endogenous glucose production, hepatic insulin sensitivity or fasting concentrations of glucose, insulin, glucagon and GLP-1 between the groups. The findings suggest that the effect of TCF7L2 on diabetes risk may include reduced secretion of GIP.
22876943	Anti-inflammatory trends of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) are constituted by a three CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN system. The biosynthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN is initiated by CHEMICALNOTIN. Notable pharmacological activities of CHEMICALNOTIN and its derivatives include anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antibacterial, antimalarial, antituberculosis, antitumor, antimicrobial and antiviral effects respectively. Owing to simplicity of the chemical structures and a huge variety of pharmacological actions exhibited, the entities derived from CHEMICALNOTIN are subjected to extensive consideration. This review article is an effort to sum up the anti-inflammatory activities of CHEMICALNOTIN derived chemical entities. Effect of CHEMICALIN on lipid peroxidation, GENEIN(GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and expression of cell adhesion molecules (CAM) is summarized stepwise.
22884520	CHEMICALNOTIN generation and GENENOTIN-dependent reverse CHEMICALNOTIN transport: not all roads lead to Rome. Cell CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism is a tightly regulated process, dependent in part on activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) to increase expression of genes mediating removal of excess CHEMICALNOTIN from cells in the reverse CHEMICALNOTIN transport pathway. GENEIN are thought to be activated predominantly by CHEMICALIN generated enzymatically from CHEMICALNOTIN in different cell organelles. Defects resulting in slowed release of CHEMICALNOTIN from late endosomes and lysosomes or reduction in GENEIN activity lead to specific blocks in CHEMICALIN production and impaired GENENOTIN-dependent gene activation. This block does not appear to be compensated by CHEMICALNOTIN production in other cell compartments. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge about CHEMICALIN-dependent activation by GENEIN of genes involved in reverse CHEMICALNOTIN transport, and what these defects of cell CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis can teach us about the critical pathways of CHEMICALIN generation for expression of GENEIN-dependent genes.
22898132	Assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryo teratogenicity assay. In this study we analyzed some aspects of the assessment of developmental delay in the zebrafish embryotoxicity/teratogenicity test and explored the suitability of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity as a biochemical marker and as a higher throughput alternative to morphological endpoints such as head-trunk angle, tail length and morphological score. Embryos were exposed from 4 to 52 h post-fertilization (hpf) to a selection of known embryotoxic/teratogen compounds (valproic acid, retinoic acid, caffeine, sodium salicylate, glucose, hydroxyurea, methoxyacetic acid, boric acid and paraoxon-methyl) over a concentration range. They were evaluated for AChE activity, head-trunk angle, tail length and several qualitative parameters integrated in a morphological score. In general, the different patterns of the concentration-response curves allowed distinguishing between chemicals that produced growth retardation (valproic and methoxyacetic acid) and chemicals that produced non-growth-delay related malformations. An acceptable correlation between the morphological score, AChE activity and head-trunk angle as markers of developmental delay was observed, being AChE activity particularly sensitive to detect delay in the absence of malformations.
22898212	CHEMICALIN makes multiple adducts on free CHEMICALNOTIN, but does not form an adduct on CHEMICALIN 438 of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a suspected causative agent of "aerotoxic syndrome", affecting pilots, crew members and passengers. CHEMICALNOTIN is produced in vivo from ortho-containing isomers of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a component of jet engine lubricants and hydraulic fluids. CHEMICALIN irreversibly inhibits GENEIN (GENEIN) in human plasma by forming adducts on the active site CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN-198). Inhibited GENENOTIN undergoes aging to release CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The active site CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN-438) was hypothesized to abstract CHEMICALNOTIN moiety from the initial adduct on CHEMICALNOTIN-198. Our goal was to test this hypothesis. Mass spectral analysis of CHEMICALIN-inhibited GENEIN digested with CHEMICALIN-C showed an CHEMICALIN adduct (+106amu) on CHEMICALIN 499, a residue far from the active site, but not on CHEMICALIN-438. Nevertheless, the CHEMICALNOTIN of the CHEMICALNOTIN ring of free CHEMICALNOTIN formed a variety of adducts upon reaction with CHEMICALNOTIN, including the CHEMICALNOTIN adduct, suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN adducts may form on other proteins.
22898566	The role of long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in reducing lipid peroxidation among elderly patients with mild cognitive impairment: a case-control study. The present work explores the effect of dietary omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) intake on lipid peroxidation among mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients. The plasma lipid hydroperoxide (LPO) levels in 67 MCI patients were compared to those of 134 healthy elderly controls. Omega-3 PUFA intake was assessed using an interviewer-administered food frequency questionnaire. Apolipoprotein E genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion. The association between various confounders and lipid peroxidation was evaluated using regression analysis. The influence of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) intake on LPO level was investigated. The results revealed that LPO levels were significantly higher in the MCI group than in the control group. Inverse correlations were found between DHA and EPA intake and LPO level among the MCI group. LPO levels decreased significantly with increasing DHA and EPA intake. In summary, the findings revealed that DHA and EPA can play a role in alleviating oxidative stress and reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases.
22902329	CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency impairs the GENENOTIN-effector system and leads to GENENOTIN overactivation and cell death in the rat hippocampus. CHEMICALNOTIN plays an essential role in maintaining the structure and function of the nervous system, and its deficiency, commonly associated with fat malabsorption diseases, may reduce neuronal survival. We previously demonstrated that the somatostatinergic system, implicated in neuronal survival control, can be modulated by CHEMICALIN in the rat dentate gyrus, increasing GENEIN phosphorylation. To gain a better understanding of the molecular actions of CHEMICALNOTIN and examine the link among CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and neuronal survival, we have investigated the effects of a deficiency and subsequent administration of CHEMICALNOTIN on the CHEMICALNOTIN signaling pathway and neuronal survival in the rat hippocampus. No changes in CHEMICALNOTIN expression were detected in CHEMICALNOTIN-deficient rats. These rats, however, showed a significant increase in the GENENOTIN density and dissociation constant, which correlated with a significant increase in the protein levels of GENENOTIN. Nevertheless, CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency impaired the ability of the GENENOTIN to couple to the effectors CHEMICALNOTIN cyclase and GENENOTIN by diminishing GENENOTIN functionality. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency significantly increased GENENOTIN activity and GENENOTIN expression, as well as GENENOTIN activation, and decreased GENENOTIN phosphorylation. All these changes were accompanied by an increase in neuronal cell death. Subsequent CHEMICALNOTIN administration partially or completely reversed all these values to control levels. Altogether, our results prove the importance of CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis in the GENENOTIN-effector system and suggest a possible mechanism by which this vitamin may regulate the neuronal cell survival in the adult hippocampus.
22918703	GENEIN sensitizes to CHEMICALIN by modulating GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN signal pathway in FRO anaplastic thyroid carcinoma cells. CHEMICALNOTIN, vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor inhibitor, suppresses hypoxia-induced angiogenesis, growth, proliferation, and metastasis in cancer cells. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has pivotal roles in regulation of growth and survival. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on cell survival, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signal pathway in FRO anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) cells. Moreover, we investigated the roles of GENEIN in cell survival under condition of CHEMICALIN treatment in FRO ATC cells. After CHEMICALIN treatment, cell viability, GENEIN, and GENEIN protein levels were not changed. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein levels decreased while GENENOTIN protein levels increased. GENENOTIN protein levels were not altered. In CHEMICALNOTIN-treated situation, cell viability was not different before and after administration of either GENENOTIN siRNA or CHEMICALNOTIN whereas it was lessened after co-administration of GENENOTIN siRNA and CHEMICALNOTIN. Compared to CHEMICALNOTIN treatment alone, cell viability was reduced with GENENOTIN plasmid but it was unchanged with GENENOTIN siRNA. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein levels with GENENOTIN plasmid were elevated whereas the protein levels with GENENOTIN siRNA were similar. While GENENOTIN plasmid transfection diminished GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein levels, GENENOTIN siRNA transfection did not alter the protein levels. In conclusion, these results suggest that GENENOTIN may sensitize FRO ATC cells to CHEMICALIN thereby inhibiting cell survival by modulating GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN signal pathway. Furthermore, these findings imply that GENEIN may be a possible candidate as the chemosensitizing factor for induction of cytotoxicity in ATC cells exposed to CHEMICALIN.
22926699	An overview of transcriptional regulation in response to toxicological insult. The completion of the human genome project and the subsequent advent of DNA microarray and high-throughput sequencing technologies have led to a renaissance in molecular toxicology. Toxicogenomic data sets, from both in vivo and in vitro studies, are growing exponentially, providing a wealth of information on regulation of stress pathways at the transcriptome level. Through such studies, we are now beginning to appreciate the diversity and complexity of biological responses to xenobiotics. In this review, we aim to consolidate and summarise the major toxicologically relevant transcription factor-governed molecular pathways. It is becoming clear that different chemical entities can cause oxidative, genotoxic and proteotoxic stress, which induce cellular responses in an effort to restore homoeostasis. Primary among the response pathways involved are NFE2L2 (Nrf2), NFE2L1 (Nrf1), p53, heat shock factor and the unfolded protein response. Additionally, more specific mechanisms exist where xenobiotics act as ligands, including the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, metal-responsive transcription factor-1 and the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. Other pathways including the immunomodulatory transcription factors NF-κB and STAT together with the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF are also implicated in cellular responses to xenobiotic exposure. A less specific but equally important aspect to cellular injury controlled by transcriptional activity is loss of tissue-specific gene expression, resulting in dedifferentiation of target cells and compromise of tissue function. Here, we review these pathways and the genes they regulate in order to provide an overview of this growing field of molecular toxicology.
22931533	Cholinergic modulation by GENENOTIN ligands: potential application to Alzheimer's disease. CHEMICALNOTIN have a storied history in medicinal chemistry as pain management drugs but have received attention as modulators of cholinergic signaling for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). CHEMICALIN is a reversible, competitive GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor and allosteric potentiating ligand of GENEIN (GENEIN-APL) that shares many common structural elements with CHEMICALNOTIN-based opioids. The structurally diverse opioids CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, like CHEMICALIN, are also GENEIN-APL that have greatly diminished affinity for GENEIN, representing potential lead compounds for selective GENEIN-APL development. In accordance with the emerging repurposing trend of evaluating known compounds for novel pharmacological activity, ongoing research on augmentation of cholinergic signaling that has been aided by the use of opioids will be reviewed.
22931535	Adhesion of osteoblasts to a vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube surface. The adhesion of cells to vertically aligned TiO2 nanotubes is reviewed. The attraction between a negatively charged nanotube surface and a negatively charged osteoblast is facilitated by charged protein-mediators like proteins with a quadrupolar internal charge distribution, fibronectin and vitronectin. It is shown that adhesion and spreading of osteoblasts on vertically aligned TiO2 nanotube surfaces depend on the diameter of the nanotubes. Apparently, a small diameter nanotube surface has on average more sharp convex edges per unit area than a large one, leading to stronger binding affinity on its surface.
22946701	Abnormal uterine bleeding and dysfunctional uterine bleeding in pediatric and adolescent gynecology. Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), which is defined as excessively heavy, prolonged and/or frequent bleeding of uterine origin, is a frequent cause of visits to the Emergency Department and/or health care provider. While there are many etiologies of AUB, the one most likely among otherwise healthy adolescents is dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB), which is characterizing any AUB when all possible underlying pathologic causes have been previously excluded. The most common cause of DUB in adolescence is anovulation, which is very frequent in the first 2-3 post-menarchal years and is associated with immaturity of the hypothalamic - pituitary - ovarian axis. Management of AUB is based on the underlying etiology and the severity of the bleeding and primary goals are prevention of complications, such as anemia and reestablishment of regular cyclical bleeding, while the management of DUB can in part be directed by the amount of flow, the degree of associated anemia, as well as patient and family comfort with different treatment modalities. Treatment options for DUB are: combined oral contraceptives (COCs), CHEMICALNOTIN, non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), CHEMICALNOTIN (anti-fibrinolytic), GENEIN analogues, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN releasing intra uterine system (LNG IUS).
22967140	Role of GENENOTIN on the modulation of GENENOTIN-positive cell number in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of ovariectomised female rats. Modulation of the CHEMICALIN producing system (demonstrated via the GENEIN histochemical reaction) by CHEMICALNOTIN has been established in several structures of the rat brain. The present study aimed to explore the possible regulation of GENENOTIN activity by CHEMICALNOTIN in neurones of the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei and the role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) in this regulation. Adult ovariectomised rats were divided into six groups and injected either with vehicle or a single dose of CHEMICALNOTIN, a selective GENEIN agonist-CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], a selective GENEIN agonist-CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], a selective GENEIN antagonist-CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN]-CHEMICALIN] or a selective GENEIN antagonist-CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). The number of GENENOTIN positive elements in the SON and the PVN was modulated by both GENENOTIN but, depending on the nucleus, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN ligands induced different effects. These results suggest that the regulation of nitrergic system by GENEIN may play a role in the control of CHEMICALIN-dependent physiological mechanisms regulated by the SON and the PVN.
22981459	GENENOTIN as a stoichiometric bioscavenger for treatment of nerve agent poisoning. Potent CHEMICALNOTIN (OP) agents, such as VX, are hazardous by absorption through the skin and are resistant to conventional pharmacological antidotal treatments. The residence time of a stoichiometric bioscavenger, GENEIN (GENEIN), in the plasma more closely matches that of VX than do the residence times of conventional therapy drugs (CHEMICALIN, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant). Intramuscular (i.m.) GENENOTIN afforded almost complete protection when administered prior to the onset of observable cholinergic signs of VX poisoning, but once signs of poisoning became evident the efficacy of i.m. GENENOTIN decreased. A combination of nerve agent therapy drugs (CHEMICALIN, anti-muscarinic, anticonvulsant) with GENEIN (i.m.) protected 100% (8/8) of guinea-pigs from a lethal dose of VX (0.74mg/kg) to 48h, even when administered on signs of poisoning. Survival was presumed to be due to immediate alleviation of the cholinergic crisis by the conventional pharmacological treatment drugs, in conjunction with bioscavenger that prevented further absorbed agent reaching the GENENOTIN targets. Evidence to support this proposed mechanism of action was obtained from PKPD experiments in which multiple blood samples and microdialysate samples were collected from individual conscious ambulatory animals. Plasma concentrations of intramuscularly-administered CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN reached a peak within 15min and were eliminated rapidly within 4h. Plasma concentrations of GENENOTIN administered by the i.m. route took approximately 24h to reach a peak, but were well-maintained over the subsequent 7days. Thus, the pharmacological therapy rapidly treated the initial signs of poisoning, whilst the bioscavenger provided prolonged protection by neutralising further nerve agent entering the bloodstream and preventing it from reaching the target organs.
22982206	CHEMICALIN sensitizes GENEIN-induced apoptosis via the upregulation of GENEIN in an GENEIN/GENEIN-dependent manner. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is one of the most promising candidates for new cancer therapeutics. However, resistance to GENENOTIN in some cancers remains a current problem in recent. The protein-folding compartment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is particularly sensitive to disturbances, which, if severe, may trigger apoptosis. Therefore, we examined whether CHEMICALIN (VA) sensitize GENEIN-induced apoptosis in cancer cells by induction of ER stress. We first found that VA induces a major molecule of ER stress, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-dependent GENENOTIN induction and subsequently increases GENENOTIN-induced cleavage of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN-resistant Hep3B cells. Importantly, the transient knockdown using siRNA for GENENOTIN abrogated VA-induced GENENOTIN expression and attenuated GENENOTIN-induced apoptosis. Treatment with VA also increased the levels of phosphorylation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which is a common cellular response of ER stress. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN, a specific GENEIN phosphorylation-inducing agent, increased GENEIN and GENEIN expression in the presence of VA. In contrast, transfection of mutant-GENENOTIN significantly reversed VA-induced apoptosis with downregulation of GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN expression. Therefore, VA-induced GENENOTIN phosphorylation seemed to be important for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN upregulation and GENENOTIN-induced apoptosis. In addition, generation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) is an effector molecular in sensitization of VA-induced ER stress. We concluded that VA triggers GENENOTIN-induced apoptosis by GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN induction via ROS generation.
22991293	Proteolytic processing of osteopontin by PHEX and accumulation of osteopontin fragments in Hyp mouse bone, the murine model of X-linked hypophosphatemia. X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH/HYP)-with renal phosphate wasting, hypophosphatemia, osteomalacia, and tooth abscesses-is caused by mutations in the zinc-metallopeptidase PHEX gene (phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidase on the X chromosome). PHEX is highly expressed by mineralized tissue cells. Inactivating mutations in PHEX lead to distal renal effects (implying accumulation of a secreted, circulating phosphaturic factor) and accumulation in bone and teeth of mineralization-inhibiting, acidic serine- and aspartate-rich motif (ASARM)-containing peptides, which are proteolytically derived from the mineral-binding matrix proteins of the SIBLING family (small, integrin-binding ligand N-linked glycoproteins). Although the latter observation suggests a local, direct matrix effect for PHEX, its physiologically relevant substrate protein(s) have not been identified. Here, we investigated two SIBLING proteins containing the ASARM motif-osteopontin (OPN) and bone sialoprotein (BSP)-as potential substrates for PHEX. Using cleavage assays, gel electrophoresis, and mass spectrometry, we report that OPN is a full-length protein substrate for PHEX. Degradation of OPN was essentially complete, including hydrolysis of the ASARM motif, resulting in only very small residual fragments. Western blotting of Hyp (the murine homolog of human XLH) mouse bone extracts having no PHEX activity clearly showed accumulation of an ∼35 kDa OPN fragment that was not present in wild-type mouse bone. Immunohistochemistry and immunogold labeling (electron microscopy) for OPN in Hyp bone likewise showed an accumulation of OPN and/or its fragments compared with normal wild-type bone. Incubation of Hyp mouse bone extracts with PHEX resulted in the complete degradation of these fragments. In conclusion, these results identify full-length OPN and its fragments as novel, physiologically relevant substrates for PHEX, suggesting that accumulation of mineralization-inhibiting OPN fragments may contribute to the mineralization defect seen in the osteomalacic bone characteristic of XLH/HYP.
22991447	Targeted disruption of inducible nitric oxide synthase protects against aging, S-nitrosation, and insulin resistance in muscle of male mice. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that S-nitrosation of proteins plays a critical role in several human diseases. Here, we explored the role of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the S-nitrosation of proteins involved in the early steps of the insulin-signaling pathway and insulin resistance in the skeletal muscle of aged mice. Aging increased iNOS expression and S-nitrosation of major proteins involved in insulin signaling, thereby reducing insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle. Conversely, aged iNOS-null mice were protected from S-nitrosation-induced insulin resistance. Moreover, pharmacological treatment with an iNOS inhibitor and acute exercise reduced iNOS-induced S-nitrosation and increased insulin sensitivity in the muscle of aged animals. These findings indicate that the insulin resistance observed in aged mice is mainly mediated through the S-nitrosation of the insulin-signaling pathway.
22992330	Genetic correlate of cognitive training response in schizophrenia. Intensive computerized auditory training results in improved cognition for schizophrenia patients, but participants show variation in their cognitive gains and the biological factors that affect the response to training are unknown. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene have been related to cognitive function. Here we asked if functional variation in this gene has an impact on the response of schizophrenia patients to cognitive training. We genotyped 48 schizophrenia patients who completed 50 h of computerized cognitive training and analyzed the association between DNA variants in the COMT gene and the improvement in global cognition. Although conventional analyses did not reveal any significant associations, a set-based analysis examining the aggregate effect of common variation in the COMT gene (42 SNPs) suggested association with improvement in global cognition. Eight SNPs, mostly located in the 3' end of the COMT gene, were nominally associated with improvement in cognition. These data suggest that genotype influences the response to intensive cognitive training in schizophrenia, and may indicate that cognitive training regimens need to be personalized to the underlying biosignatures of each individual patient. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
22996137	Microtubule network is required for GENENOTIN-induced signal transduction and actin remodeling. Both microtubule and GENENOTIN are required for GENENOTIN-induced CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. However, the roles of these two cytoskeletons and their relationship in GENENOTIN action still remain unclear. In this work, we examined the morphological change of microtubule/GENENOTIN and their involvement in GENENOTIN signal transduction using rat skeletal muscle cells. GENENOTIN rapidly led to microtubule clustering from ventral to dorsal surface of the cell. Microtubule filaments were rearranged to create space where new GENENOTIN structures formed. Disruption of microtubule prevented GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN remodeling and distal GENENOTIN signal transduction, with reduction in surface GENEIN (GENEIN) and CHEMICALIN uptake. Though microtubule mediated GENENOTIN remodeling through GENENOTIN, reorganization of microtubule depended on CHEMICALIN phosphorylation of GENEIN, the mechanism is different from GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN remodeling, which relied on the activity of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. We propose that microtubule network is required for GENENOTIN-induced signal transduction and GENENOTIN remodeling in skeletal muscle cells.
23007560	The influence of chronic fluorosis on mitochondrial dynamics morphology and distribution in cortical neurons of the rat brain. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of chronic fluorosis on the dynamics (including fusion and fission proteins), fragmentation, and distribution of mitochondria in the cortical neurons of the rat brain in an attempt to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying the brain damage associated with excess accumulation of fluoride. Sixty Sprague-Dawley rats were divided randomly into three groups of 20 each, that is, the untreated control group (drinking water naturally containing <0.5 mg fluoride/l, NaF), the low-fluoride group (whose drinking water was supplemented with 10 mg fluoride/l) and the high-fluoride group (50 mg fluoride/l). After 6 months of exposure, the expression of mitofusin-1 (Mfn1), fission-1 (Fis1), and dynamin-related protein-1 (Drp1) at both the protein and mRNA levels were detected by Western blotting, immunohistochemistry, and real-time PCR, respectively. Moreover, mitochondrial morphology and distribution in neurons were observed by transmission electron or fluorescence microscopy. In the cortices of the brains of rats with chronic fluorosis, the level of Mfn1 protein was clearly reduced, whereas the levels of Fis1 and Drp1 were elevated. The alternations of expression of the mRNAs encoding all three of these proteins were almost the same as the corresponding changes at the protein levels. The mitochondria were fragmented and the redistributed away from the axons of the cortical neurons. These findings indicate that chronic fluorosis induces abnormal mitochondrial dynamics, which might in turn result in a high level of oxidative stress.
23015691	Quantitative analysis of the interaction of GENENOTIN with chemicals and GENENOTIN using surface plasmon resonance biosensor systems: a case study of the Baikal seal (Pusa sibirica) and the mouse. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) not only displays a high basal transcriptional activity but also acts as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor. It is known that GENENOTIN exhibits different ligand profiles across species. However, the mechanisms underlying GENENOTIN activation by chemicals and the species-specific responses are not fully understood. The objectives of this study are to establish a high-throughput tool to screen GENENOTIN ligands and to clarify how GENENOTIN proteins from the Baikal seal (GENENOTIN) and the mouse (GENENOTIN) interact with chemicals and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). We developed the surface plasmon resonance (SPR) system to assess quantitatively the interaction of GENENOTIN with potential ligands and GENENOTIN. The ligand-binding domain (LBD) of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was synthesized in a wheat germ cell-free system. The purified GENENOTIN was then immobilized on the sensor chip for the SPR assay, and the kinetics of direct interaction of GENENOTIN with ligand candidates was measured. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN showed compound-specific but similar affinities for both GENEIN. The GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interaction was ligand dependent but exhibited a different ligand profile between the seal and the mouse. The results of GENENOTIN interaction assay accounted for those of our previous in vitro GENENOTIN-mediated transactivation assay. In silico analyses also supported the results of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interaction; there is little structural difference in the ligand-binding pocket of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, but there is a distinct discrimination in the helix 11 and 12 of these receptors, suggesting that the interaction of ligand-bound GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN is critical for determining species-specific and ligand-dependent transactivation over the basal activity. The SPR assays demonstrated a potential as a high-throughput screening tool of GENENOTIN ligands.
23017389	Studies on the antioxidant potential of flavones of Allium vineale isolated from its water-soluble fraction. The aim of this work was to examine the chemical constituents and antioxidant potential of water-soluble fractions from the commonly consumed vegetable, Allium vineale. The water-soluble fraction, containing phenolic compounds, was extracted with ethyl acetate to obtain flavonoids which were separated and purified by repeated column chromatography over Sephadex LH-20, RP C18 and silica gel. The isolated compounds were identified according to their physicochemical properties and spectral data (UV, HPLC-TOF/MS, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and 2D NMR). Three flavonoids were isolated and identified as chrysoeriol-7-O-[2″-O-E-feruloyl]-β-d-glucoside (1), chrysoeriol (2), and isorhamnetin-3-β-d-glucoside (3). Antioxidant studies of the aqueous extract and three isolated compounds, 1, 2, 3, were undertaken and they were found to have significant antioxidant activity. Antioxidant activities were evaluated for total antioxidant activity by the ferric thiocyanate method, ferric ion (Fe(3+)) reducing antioxidant power assay (FRAP), ferrous ion (Fe(2+)) metal chelating activity, and DPPH free radical-scavenging activity. The water-soluble ethyl acetate and methanol extraction methods were also compared using HPLC-TOF/MS.
23017415	Amino acid composition, antinutrients and allergens in the peanut protein fraction obtained by an aqueous enzymatic process. Enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction (EAE) of peanut kernel was used to extract oil and protein. The aqueous fraction (AF) obtained by EAE had a better essential amino acid profile than the residues obtained by solvent extraction (Rs) and cold pressing (Rc). No major difference in the trypsin inhibitor activity among AF, Rs and Rc was observed; however, the trypsin inhibitor activity was drastically reduced in the residue obtained after EAE. AF was subjected to MALDI-TOF/MS, revealing it to be rich in peptides (107) with molecular masses from m/z 700 to 2369Da. AF had an extremely low phytate content and was rich in peptides, which could be used as a food supplement. ESI-MS/MS data were used for the identification of major peanut allergens, viz., Ara h1, h3, h6-8. Their allergenic potential needs to be established.
23022398	GENENOTIN blockade impairs the muscarinic conversion of sub-threshold transient depression into long-lasting LTD in the hippocampus-prefrontal cortex pathway in vivo: correlation with gamma oscillations. Cholinergic fibers from the brainstem and basal forebrain innervate the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) modulating neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity responses to hippocampal inputs. Here, we investigated the muscarinic and glutamatergic modulation of long-term depression (LTD) in the intact projections from CA1 to mPFC in vivo. Cortical-evoked responses were recorded in CHEMICALNOTIN-anesthetized rats for 30 min during baseline and 4 h following LTD. In order to test the potentiating effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), independent groups of rats received either a microinjection of CHEMICALNOTIN (40 nmol; i.c.v.) or vehicle, immediately before or 20 min after a sub-threshold LTD protocol (600 pulses, 1 Hz; LFS600). Other groups received either an infusion of the selective GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN; 10 nmol; intra-mPFC) or vehicle, 10 min prior to CHEMICALIN preceding LFS600, or prior to a supra-threshold LTD protocol (900 pulses, 1 Hz; LFS900). Our results show that CHEMICALNOTIN converts a transient cortical depression induced by LFS600 into a robust LTD, stable for at least 4 h. When applied after LFS600, CHEMICALNOTIN does not change either mPFC basal neurotransmission or late LTD. Our data also indicate that GENEIN pre-activation is essential to the muscarinic enhancement of mPFC synaptic depression, since CHEMICALIN microinjection into the mPFC blocked the conversion of transient depression into long-lasting LTD produced by CHEMICALIN. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN effectively blocked the long-lasting LTD induced by LFS900. Therefore, our findings suggest that the glutamatergic co-activation of prefrontal neurons is important for the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on mPFC synaptic depression, which could play an important role in the control of executive and emotional functions.
23024204	Metabolism of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN by the GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN; Merck Rahway, NJ), a drug for Wilson's disease, is a CHEMICALNOTIN chelator and a charge-deficient analog of CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN. We recently showed that CHEMICALIN is metabolized in vitro by CHEMICALIN catabolic enzyme GENEIN (GENEIN) and by GENEIN (GENEIN) to its monoacetylated derivative (MAT). The acetylation of CHEMICALIN is increased in GENEIN-overexpressing mice compared with wild-type mice. However, GENENOTIN-deficient mice metabolize CHEMICALIN at the same rate as the wild-type mice, indicating the existence of another GENEIN respons 2ible for its metabolism in mice. Here, we show that siRNA-mediated knockdown of GENEIN in HEPG2 cells and in primary hepatocytes from the GENENOTIN-deficient or wild-type mice reduced the metabolism of CHEMICALIN to MAT. By contrast, CHEMICALIN(CHEMICALIN), a charge-deficient CHEMICALIN analog, was an extremely poor substrate of GENEIN and was metabolized by GENEIN in HEPG2 cells and in wild-type primary hepatocytes. Thus, despite the similar structures of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN is the main acetylator of CHEMICALIN, whereas CHEMICALIN is primarily acetylated by GENEIN.
23030680	In vitro metabolism of the GENEIN receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN. The metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN has been examined in vitro using hepatic microsomes from human and recombinant heterologously expressed GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Metabolism occurs primarily via oxidative CHEMICALNOTIN-demethylation to form M4 and oxidation reactions to form CHEMICALNOTIN (M5) and CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite (M3). Additionally, CHEMICALNOTIN was shown to be metabolized to the novel cyclized CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite (M6) which undergoes subsequent oxidation to form the CHEMICALNOTIN ion metabolite (M3a). The GENENOTIN data was normalized relative to the levels of each GENENOTIN form in native human liver microsomes to better assess the contribution of each GENEIN in the metabolism of CHEMICALIN. Results demonstrated the involvement of GENENOTIN in the pathways leading to M3a, M3, M5 and M6 and GENENOTIN in the formation of M4. Kinetic constants for the formation of M3 were determined and correlation and inhibition studies suggested that GENENOTIN is primarily responsible for the formation of M3 and GENENOTIN plays a very minor role in its formation. GENEIN has shown to be an essential component in GENEIN catalyzed CHEMICALIN formation and provides insights on the disconnect between human liver microsomes data and that of GENENOTIN. Furthermore, GENENOTIN containing b5 are useful models for predicting the rates for liver microsomes GENENOTIN-dependent drug oxidations and should be utilized routinely.
23030766	Effective phagocytosis of low GENENOTIN tumor cell lines with engineered, GENENOTIN displaying high GENENOTIN affinity and selectivity. Glycans anchored to residue N297 of the antibody GENENOTIN are critical in mediating binding toward GENENOTIN to direct both adaptive and innate immune responses. However, using a full length GENENOTIN display system, we have isolated GENENOTIN with mutations that confer up to a 160-fold increase in the affinity toward the low affinity GENENOTIN-R131 allele as well as high selectivity against binding to the remarkably homologous human inhibitory receptor, GENENOTIN. The mutant GENEIN (GENEIN) contained a total of 5 CHEMICALIN substitutions that conferred an activating to inhibitory ratio of 25 (A/I ratio; GENEIN-R131:GENEIN). Incorporation of this engineered GENENOTIN into trastuzumab, an anti-GENENOTIN antibody, resulted in a 75% increase in tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages compared to that of the parental glycosylated trastuzumab with both medium and low GENENOTIN-expressing cancer cells. A mathematical model has been developed to help explain how receptor affinity and the A/I ratio relate to improved antibody dependent cell-mediated phagocytosis. Our model provides guidelines for the future engineering of GENENOTIN with enhanced effector function.
23042728	Exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in mid-organogenesis mouse limbs. In utero exposure to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, causes neural tube, heart, and limb defects. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), the CHEMICALIN derivative of CHEMICALIN, does not inhibit GENEIN activity and is a weak teratogen in vivo. The detailed mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN as a teratogen is not known. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that CHEMICALNOTIN disrupts regulation of the expression of genes that are critical in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis during limb development. Murine gestation day-12 embryonic forelimbs were excised and exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN in a limb bud culture system. CHEMICALIN caused a significant concentration- dependent increase in limb abnormalities, which was correlated with its GENEIN inhibitory effect. The signaling of both GENEIN and GENEIN, key regulators of chondrogenesis, was downregulated by CHEMICALIN. In contrast, CHEMICALIN had little effect on limb morphology and no significant effect on GENEIN activity or the expression of marker genes. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN exposure dysregulated the expression of target genes directly involved in chondrogenesis and osteogenesis in the developing limb. Disturbances in these signaling pathways are likely to be a consequence of GENEIN inhibition because CHEMICALIN did not affect their expressions.
23042730	GENENOTIN potentiates the cytotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN in Hepa1c1c7 cells: roles of GENENOTIN activation and oxidative stress. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a class III antiarrhythmic drug, causes idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity in human patients. We demonstrated previously that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) plays an important role in a rat model of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatotoxicity under inflammatory stress. In this study, we developed a model in vitro to study the roles of GENENOTIN activation and oxidative stress in GENENOTIN potentiation of CHEMICALNOTIN cytotoxicity. CHEMICALNOTIN caused cell death in Hepa1c1c7 cells, and GENENOTIN cotreatment potentiated its toxicity. Activation of GENENOTIN was observed in CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN-cotreated cells, and caspase inhibitors provided minor protection from cytotoxicity. Intracellular reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation were observed after treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN and were further elevated by GENENOTIN cotreatment. Adding water-soluble antioxidants (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN) produced only minor attenuation of CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN-induced cytotoxicity and did not influence the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN alone. On the other hand, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which reduced lipid peroxidation and ROS generation, prevented CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity and caused pronounced reduction in cytotoxicity from CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN cotreatment. CHEMICALIN plus a GENEIN inhibitor completely abolished CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN-induced cytotoxicity. In summary, activation of GENEIN and oxidative stress were observed after CHEMICALIN/GENENOTIN cotreatment, and GENENOTIN inhibitors and a lipid-soluble free-radical scavenger attenuated CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN-induced cytotoxicity.
23044488	CHEMICALIN residues at the N- and C-termini are essential for the folding of active GENEIN polypeptide. GENEIN (GENEIN) is currently the most suitable bioscavenger for the prophylaxis of highly toxic CHEMICALIN (OP) nerve agents. A dose of 200mg of GENENOTIN is envisioned as a prophylactic treatment that can protect humans from an exposure of up to 2×LD50 of soman. The limited availability and administration of multiple doses of this stoichiometric bioscavenger make this pretreatment difficult. Thus, the goal of this study was to produce a smaller enzymatically active GENENOTIN polypeptide (HBP) that could bind to nerve agents with high affinity thereby reducing the dose of enzyme. Studies have indicated that the three-dimensional structure and the domains of GENEIN (CHEMICALIN pocket, lip of the active center gorge, and the anionic substrate-binding domain) that are critical for the binding of substrate are also essential for the selectivity and binding of inhibitors including OPs. Therefore, we designed three HBPs by deleting some N- and C-terminal residues of GENENOTIN by maintaining the folds of the active site core that includes the three active site residues (S198, E325, and H438). GENENOTIN that lacks 45 residues from C-terminus but known to have GENENOTIN activity was used as a control. The cDNAs for the HBPs containing signal sequences were synthesized, cloned into different mammalian expression vectors, and recombinant polypeptides were transiently expressed in different cell lines. No GENENOTIN activity was detected in the culture media of cells transfected with any of the newly designed HBPs, and the inactive polypeptides remained inside the cells. Only enzymatically active GENENOTIN was secreted into the culture medium. These results suggest that residues at the N- and C-termini are required for the folding and/or maintenance of HBP into an active stable, conformation.
23053666	GENEIN and GENEIN regulate sensitivity to CHEMICALIN by controlling expression of the GENEIN GENEIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are the major structural molecules that form tight junctions (TJs) between epithelial cells. We found that knockdown of the expression of either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN produced marked changes in the phenotype of ovarian cancer cells, including an increase in resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN (cDDP). The effect of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN on cDDP cytotoxicity, cDDP cellular accumulation, and DNA adduct formation was compared in the GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN-expressing parental human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells and GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN knockdown sublines (GENENOTINKD and GENENOTINKD, respectively). Knockdown of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN rendered human ovarian carcinoma 2008 cells resistant to cDDP in both in vitro culture and in vivo xenograft model. The net accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and the CHEMICALNOTIN-DNA adduct levels were reduced in GENENOTINKD and GENENOTINKD cells. The endogenous mRNA levels of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN were found to be significantly reduced in the knockdown cells, and exogenous expression of GENENOTIN restored their sensitivity to cDDP. Reexpression of an shRNAi-resistant GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN up-regulated GENENOTIN levels, reversed the cDDP resistance, and enhanced TJ formation in the knockdown cells. Baseline CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) level, CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, and CHEMICALNOTIN cytotoxicity were also reduced in GENENOTINKD and GENENOTINKD cells. CHEMICALIN-dependent GENEIN activity was also markedly reduced in both types of GENENOTIN knockdown cells when incubated with the substrate CHEMICALIN. These results indicate that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN affect sensitivity of the ovarian cancer cells to the cytotoxic effect of cDDP by regulating expression of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN.
23055538	Regulation of hepatic phase II metabolism in pregnant mice. Phase II enzymes, including GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, are critical for the disposition and detoxification of endo- and xenobiotics. In this study, the mRNA and protein expression of major phase II enzymes, as well as key regulatory transcription factors, were quantified in livers of time-matched pregnant and virgin control C57BL/6 mice on gestation days (GD) 7, 11, 14, 17, and postnatal days (PND) 1, 15, and 30. Compared with virgin controls, the mRNA expression of GENENOTIN decreased 40 to 80% in pregnant dams. Protein expression of GENEIN also decreased and corresponded with reduced in vitro glucuronidation of CHEMICALIN in S9 fractions from livers of pregnant mice. Similar to GENENOTIN levels, GENENOTIN mRNAs were reduced in pregnant dams in mid to late gestation; however no change in protein expression was observed. Conversely, GENENOTIN mRNAs increased 100 to 500% at various time points in pregnant and lactating mice and corresponded with enhanced in vitro sulfation of CHEMICALNOTIN in liver S9 fractions. Coinciding with maximal decreases in GENENOTIN as well as increases in GENENOTIN, the expression of transcription factors GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN and their target genes were downregulated, whereas GENENOTIN mRNA was upregulated. Collectively, these data demonstrate altered regulation of hepatic phase II metabolism in mice during pregnancy and suggest that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN signaling pathways may be candidate signaling pathways responsible for these changes.
23056222	CHEMICALIN attenuates renal fibrosis via GENEIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN/GENEIN signaling. GENENOTIN plays a key role in the development of renal fibrosis. Suppressing the GENENOTIN signaling pathway is a possible therapeutic approach for preventing this disease, and reports have suggested that GENENOTIN protects against renal fibrosis by inhibiting GENENOTIN signaling. This study examines whether CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which stimulates GENENOTIN, prevents renal fibrosis via the GENENOTIN-mediated suppression of GENENOTIN signaling. Results showed that CHEMICALIN increased nuclear levels of GENEIN, and both CHEMICALIN and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of GENEIN (Ad-GENENOTIN) decreased GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN and GENEIN expression in GENEIN-treated rat mesangial cells (RMCs) and renal fibroblast cells (NRK-49F). Additionally, CHEMICALIN and Ad-GENENOTIN repressed GENEIN-stimulated GENEIN activity by inhibiting GENEIN phosphorylation, which was restored by siRNA-mediated knockdown of GENENOTIN expression. However, downregulation of the GENEIN (GENEIN)-driven GENEIN target genes such as GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN) did not reverse the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-induced upregulation of profibrotic genes or extracellular matrix proteins, suggesting an GENEIN-independent anti-fibrotic activity of CHEMICALIN. Finally, CHEMICALIN suppressed unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO)-induced renal fibrosis and GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN expression in the obstructed kidneys from UUO mice, along with increased and decreased expression of GENEIN and GENEIN, respectively. In summary, CHEMICALIN attenuated renal fibrosis via the GENEIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN/GENEIN signaling in an GENEIN-independent manner, suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN could be used to treat renal fibrosis.
23059626	The effect of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in bone remodeling induced by mechanical loading during orthodontic tooth movement in mice. Bone remodeling is affected by mechanical loading and inflammatory mediators, including GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is involved in bone remodeling by binding to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) expressed on osteoclasts and osteoblasts. Our group has previously demonstrated that GENENOTIN down-regulates mechanical loading-induced bone resorption. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the role of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in bone remodeling induced by mechanical loading during orthodontic tooth movement in mice. Our results showed that bone remodeling was significantly decreased in GENENOTIN(-/-) and GENENOTIN(-/-) mice and in animals treated with CHEMICALIN-RANTES (an antagonist of GENEIN and GENEIN). mRNA levels of GENEIN (GENEIN), its ligand GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN/GENEIN (GENEIN) ratio were diminished in the periodontium of GENENOTIN(-/-) mice and in the group treated with CHEMICALIN-RANTES. CHEMICALIN-RANTES treatment also reduced the levels of GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN). The expression of the osteoblast markers GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN was decreased, while GENEIN (GENEIN) was augmented in GENENOTIN(-/-) and CHEMICALIN-RANTES-treated mice. Altogether, these findings show that GENENOTIN is pivotal for bone remodeling induced by mechanical loading during orthodontic tooth movement and these actions depend, at least in part, on GENENOTIN.
23059655	Nano-graphene in biomedicine: theranostic applications. Owing to their unique physical and chemical properties, graphene and its derivatives such as graphene oxide (GO), reduced graphene oxide (RGO) and GO-nanocomposites have attracted tremendous interest in many different fields including biomedicine in recent years. With every atom exposed on its surface, single-layered graphene shows ultra-high surface area available for efficient molecular loading and bioconjugation, and has been widely explored as novel nano-carriers for drug and gene delivery. Utilizing the intrinsic near-infrared (NIR) optical absorbance, in vivo graphene-based photothermal therapy has been realized, achieving excellent anti-tumor therapeutic efficacy in animal experiments. A variety of inorganic nanoparticles can be grown on the surface of nano-graphene, obtaining functional graphene-based nanocomposites with interesting optical and magnetic properties useful for multi-modal imaging and imaging-guided cancer therapy. Moreover, significant efforts have also been devoted to study the behaviors and toxicology of functionalized nano-graphene in animals. It has been uncovered that both surface chemistry and sizes play key roles in controlling the biodistribution, excretion, and toxicity of nano-graphene. Biocompatibly coated nano-graphene with ultra-small sizes can be cleared out from body after systemic administration, without rendering noticeable toxicity to the treated mice. In this review article, we will summarize the latest progress in this rapidly growing field, and discuss future prospects and challenges of using graphene-based materials for theranostic applications.
23061466	GENENOTIN channel blockers and its structural analysis for drug design. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a GENENOTIN protein mainly expressed in the heart and the nervous systems and its blockade by non-cardiovascular acting drugs resulted in tachycardia and sudden death. In this present review, we have focused the physicochemical properties responsible for the GENENOTIN blocking activity of structurally different compounds. The reported research works showed that the hydrophobicity on the van der Waals (vdW) surface of the molecules (aroused from the aromatic ring) necessary for the GENENOTIN blocking activity along with topological and electronic properties. The CHEMICALIN (natural products) such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN carry the common molecular structure of CHEMICALIN that possessed positive ionotropic effect and GENEIN blocking activity. CHEMICALNOTIN (previously named CHEMICALNOTIN) was isolated from the root of Aconitum coreanum (Levl.), is an anti-arrhythmic drug in phase IV clinical trial. The CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) induces a concentration-dependent decrease in current amplitude (IC50 of 7.419 MM). Most of these natural product compounds contain non-flexible aromatic structures but have significant activity due to the presence of optimum hydrophobicity. Recent research works revealed that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN channels are expressed by a variety of cancer cell lines and tissues. The GENENOTIN channel showed an oncogenic potential while GENENOTIN channels are associated with more aggressive tumors and have a role in mediating invasion. This review concluded that the consideration of physicochemical properties necessary for the GENENOTIN blocking activity will guide to develop novel drugs with less cardiotoxicity.
23063595	Multifunctional targets of dietary CHEMICALIN in disease: a case for the GENEIN network and energy metabolism. Chronic, non-acute inflammation is behind conditions that represent most of the disease burden in humans and is clearly linked to immune and metabolic mechanisms. The convergence of pathways involving the immune response, oxidative stress, increased circulating lipids and aberrant GENENOTIN signaling results in GENENOTIN-associated macrophage recruitment and altered energy metabolism. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway and the energy sensor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are attractive therapeutic targets as a part of preventive management of disease. Several effects of CHEMICALIN are useful in this scenario, including a reduction in the activities of GENEIN and modulation of cellular metabolism through GENEIN inhibitors, GENEIN activators, calorie-restriction mimetics or epigenetic regulators. Research is currently underway to develop orally active drugs with these effects, but it is convenient to examine more closely what we are eating. If a lack of relevance in terms of toxicity and substantial effectiveness are confirmed, plant-derived components may provide useful druggable components and dietary supplements. We consider therapeutic actions as a combination of synergistic and/or antagonistic interactions in a multi-target strategy. Hence, improvement in food through enrichment with CHEMICALNOTIN with demonstrated activity may represent a major advance in the design of diets with both industrial and sanitary value.
23064031	Inhibition of GENEIN/GENEIN activation with CHEMICALIN blocks migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a bioactive component of Avicennia marina, has been demonstrated to display anti-cancer activity. Activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-induced signaling pathway has been correlated with cancer metastasis in various tumors, including breast carcinoma. We use GENENOTIN as a metastatic inducer of MDA-MB-231 cells to investigate the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on cell migration and invasion. CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN-mediated protein levels of GENEIN and GENEIN, and reduced GENEIN expression and activity, concomitantly with a marked inhibition on cell migration and invasion without obvious cellular cytotoxicity. CHEMICALIN abrogated GENEIN-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN)/GENEIN. The specific GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, blocked significantly GENEIN-induced cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-induced GENEIN expression, cell migration and invasion, as well as the activation of GENEIN/GENEIN, suggesting that GENEIN/GENEIN activation occur downstream of GENEIN activation. These findings suggest that CHEMICALIN inhibited the GENEIN-induced invasion and migration of MDA-MB-231 cells via GENEIN-dependent GENEIN/GENEIN signaling, leading to the down-regulation of GENEIN expression. These results provide a novel mechanism to explain the role of CHEMICALNOTIN as a potent anti-metastatic agent in MDA-MB-231 cells.
23066090	A novel GENENOTIN-specific inhibitor suppresses pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are two intracellular receptors that mediate the effects of the prototypic second messenger CHEMICALNOTIN. Identifying pharmacological probes for selectively modulating GENENOTIN activity represents a significant unmet need within the research field. Herein, we report the identification and characterization of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a novel noncyclic CHEMICALIN GENEIN antagonist that is capable of specifically blocking intracellular GENEIN-mediated GENEIN activation and GENEIN phosphorylation, as well as GENEIN-mediated GENEIN secretion in pancreatic β cells. Using this novel GENENOTIN-specific inhibitor, we have probed the functional roles of overexpression of GENENOTIN in pancreatic cancer cells. Our studies show that GENENOTIN plays an important role in pancreatic cancer cell migration and invasion, and thus represents a potential target for developing novel therapeutic strategies for pancreatic cancer.
23066988	CHEMICALIN directly inhibits GENEIN secretion through GENEIN in rat primary gastric cells. The antidiabetic drug CHEMICALNOTIN causes weight loss in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. CHEMICALIN treatment is also associated with lower circulating levels of the GENEIN GENEIN. To test whether CHEMICALNOTIN directly affects GENENOTIN cells, rat primary stomach cells were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN and the levels of GENENOTIN secretion, GENENOTIN gene expression and activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were examined. CHEMICALIN significantly reduced GENEIN secretion and GENEIN mRNA production and both these effects were blocked by co-incubation with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, the GENEIN activator CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) significantly inhibited GENEIN secretion. Additionally, GENENOTIN cells were shown to express GENENOTIN. Finally, CHEMICALIN treatment caused a significant increase in the level of GENEIN. Our results show that CHEMICALIN directly inhibits stomach GENEIN production and secretion through GENEIN. This reduction in ghrelin secretion may be one of the key components in CHEMICALNOTIN's mechanism of weight loss.
23081912	Fungicide CHEMICALIN and environmental pollutant CHEMICALIN induce the GENEIN transporter in bovine mammary epithelial cells by the GENEIN signaling pathway. The molecular mechanisms by which environmental pollutants including CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) or widely used CHEMICALNOTIN fungicide CHEMICALNOTIN display their toxic effects in vertebrates are still not well understood. Using computer analysis, we recently identified nuclear GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) binding sites termed "GENENOTIN" (GENENOTIN) in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (Accession No. GENENOTIN) from the bovine mammary gland. As these regulatory motifs mediate regulation of target genes by GENEIN agonists including CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, we have systematically investigated the effect of both contaminants on functional GENENOTIN transport activity in primary bovine mammary epithelial cells. CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN doubled GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN secretion. This effect was almost completely reversed by specific GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. In further mechanistic studies, we showed that this induction was due to binding of activated GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN sequences in the GENENOTIN 5'-UTR. Receptor binding was significantly reduced by specific GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN. Induction of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN resulted in a time- and dose-dependent increase of GENEIN gene expression and transporter protein levels. As GENENOTIN represents the main mammary transporter for xenobiotics including drugs and toxins, exposure to prevalent GENENOTIN agonists may enhance transporter-mediated secretion of potential harmful compounds into milk. Through identification of mammary GENEIN as a novel target gene of pesticide CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, our results may therefore help to improve the protection of breast-feeding infants and the consumer of dairy products.
23085295	Molecular analyses of dinosaur osteocytes support the presence of endogenous molecules. The discovery of soft, transparent microstructures in dinosaur bone consistent in morphology with osteocytes was controversial. We hypothesize that, if original, these microstructures will have molecular features in common with extant osteocytes. We present immunological and mass spectrometry evidence for preservation of proteins comprising extant osteocytes (Actin, Tubulin, PHEX, Histone H4) in osteocytes recovered from two non-avian dinosaurs. Furthermore, antibodies to DNA show localized binding to these microstructures, which also react positively with DNA intercalating stains propidium iodide (PI) and 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). Each antibody binds dinosaur cells in patterns similar to extant cells. These data are the first to support preservation of multiple proteins and to present multiple lines of evidence for material consistent with DNA in dinosaurs, supporting the hypothesis that these structures were part of the once living animals. We propose mechanisms for preservation of cells and component molecules, and discuss implications for dinosaurian cellular biology.
23086748	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN nanoparticles on the liver and hepatocytes in vitro. With the increasing use and incorporation of nanoparticles (NPs) into consumer products, screening for potential toxicity is necessary to ensure customer safety. NPs have been shown to translocate to the bloodstream following inhalation and ingestion, and such studies demonstrate that the liver is an important organ for accumulation. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) NPs are highly relevant for human exposure due to their use in food contact materials, dietary supplements, and antibacterial wound treatments. Due to the large number of different NPs already used in various products and being developed for new applications, it is essential that relevant, quick, and cheap methods of in vitro risk assessment suitable for these new materials are established. Therefore, this study used a simple hepatocytes model combined with an in vivo injection model to simulate the passage of a small amount of NPs into the bloodstream following exposure, e.g., via ingestion or inhalation, and examined the potential of CHEMICALNOTIN NPs of 20 nm diameter to cause toxicity, inflammation, and oxidative stress in the liver following in vivo exposures of female Wistar rats via iv injection to 50 μg of NPs and in vitro exposures using the human hepatocyte cell line C3A. We found that CHEMICALIN NPs were highly cytotoxic to hepatocytes (LC(50) GENEIN: 2.5 μg/cm(2)) and affected hepatocyte homeostasis by reducing GENEIN release. At sublethal concentrations with normal cell or tissue morphology, CHEMICALNOTIN NPs were detected in cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes. We observed similar effects of CHEMICALIN NPs on inflammatory mediator expression in vitro and in vivo with increase of GENEIN (GENEIN)/GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN expression in both models and increased GENEIN protein release in vitro. This article presents evidence of the potential toxicity and inflammogenic potential of CHEMICALNOTIN NPs in the liver following ingestion. In addition, the similarities between in vitro and in vivo responses are striking and encouraging for future reduction, refinement, and replacement of animal studies by the use of hepatocyte cell lines in particle risk assessment.
23087260	GENEIN modulates CHEMICALIN sensitivity of the GENEIN. Unlike the majority of GENENOTIN, the GENEIN binds agonist with high affinity that is insensitive to the presence of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). We report the identification of mutations that confer CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity to agonist binding. Seven point mutations were introduced into the conserved motif in the GENEIN (GENEIN) of GENEIN, resulting in acquisition of CHEMICALIN-sensitive agonist binding. One receptor mutation GENENOTIN was studied in detail. Loss of agonist binding was observed on intact human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the GENEIN receptor, conditions where high CHEMICALIN levels are present; however, high affinity binding CHEMICALIN was observed in broken cell preparations washed free of CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALIN binding of GENEIN in broken cell membrane fractions was inhibited by addition of CHEMICALIN (IC(50) 21 ± 1.8 nM). Taken together, these results suggest that the wild-type GENENOTIN receptor displays unusual characteristics of the complex coupled equilibria between agonist-receptor and receptor-GENENOTIN interaction. Moreover, mutation of GENEIN can alter this coupled equilibrium from CHEMICALIN-insensitive agonist binding to more conventional CHEMICALIN-sensitive binding. This suggests that for the mutant receptors, GENENOTIN plays a critical role in linking the agonist bound receptor conformation to the GENEIN CHEMICALIN bound state.
23091169	Identification of Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster noncoding RNAs as novel candidate biomarkers for liver tumor promotion. The molecular events during nongenotoxic carcinogenesis and their temporal order are poorly understood but thought to include long-lasting perturbations of gene expression. Here, we have investigated the temporal sequence of molecular and pathological perturbations at early stages of phenobarbital (PB) mediated liver tumor promotion in vivo. Molecular profiling (mRNA, microRNA [miRNA], DNA methylation, and proteins) of mouse liver during 13 weeks of PB treatment revealed progressive increases in hepatic expression of long noncoding RNAs and miRNAs originating from the Dlk1-Dio3 imprinted gene cluster, a locus that has recently been associated with stem cell pluripotency in mice and various neoplasms in humans. PB induction of the Dlk1-Dio3 cluster noncoding RNA (ncRNA) Meg3 was localized to glutamine synthetase-positive hypertrophic perivenous hepatocytes, suggesting a role for β-catenin signaling in the dysregulation of Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs. The carcinogenic relevance of Dlk1-Dio3 locus ncRNA induction was further supported by in vivo genetic dependence on constitutive androstane receptor and β-catenin pathways. Our data identify Dlk1-Dio3 ncRNAs as novel candidate early biomarkers for mouse liver tumor promotion and provide new opportunities for assessing the carcinogenic potential of novel compounds.
23092877	GH improves spatial memory and reverses certain anabolic androgenic steroid-induced effects in intact rats. GH has previously been shown to promote cognitive functions in GH-deficient rodents. In this study we report the effects of GH on learning and memory in intact rats pretreated with the anabolic androgenic steroid nandrolone. Male Wistar rats received nandrolone decanoate (15 mg/kg) or peanut oil every third day for 3 weeks and were subsequently treated with recombinant human GH (1.0 IU/kg) or saline for 10 consecutive days. During the GH/saline treatment spatial learning and memory were tested in the Morris water maze (MWM). Also, plasma levels of IGF1 were assessed and the gene expression of the GH receptors (Ghr), Igf1 and Igf2, in hippocampus and frontal cortex was analyzed. The results demonstrated a significant positive effect of GH on memory functions and increased gene expression of Igf1 in the hippocampus was found in the animals treated with GH. In addition, GH was demonstrated to increase the body weight gain and was able to attenuate the reduced body weight seen in nandrolone-treated animals. In general, the rats treated with nandrolone alone did not exhibit any pronounced alteration in memory compared with controls in the MWM, and in many cases GH did not induce any alteration. Regarding target zone crossings, considered to be associated with spatial memory, the difference between GH- and steroid-treated animals was significant and administration of GH improved this parameter in the latter group. In conclusion, GH improves spatial memory in intact rats and can reverse certain effects induced by anabolic androgenic steroid.
23093023	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN contribute to GENENOTIN constriction and elevated blood pressure in intermittent hypoxia. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with cardiovascular complications including hypertension. Previous findings from our laboratory indicate that exposure to intermittent hypoxia (IH), to mimic sleep apnea, increases blood pressure in rats. IH also increases GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) constrictor sensitivity in a GENENOTIN-dependent manner in mesenteric arteries. Because GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) regulates GENENOTIN activity, we hypothesized that GENENOTIN contributes to the augmented GENENOTIN constrictor sensitivity and elevated blood pressure following IH. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to either sham or IH (cycles between 21% CHEMICALNOTIN/0% CHEMICALNOTIN and 5% CHEMICALNOTIN/5% CHEMICALNOTIN) conditions for 7 h/day for 14 or 21 days. The contribution of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN-mediated vasoconstriction was assessed in mesenteric arteries using pharmacological inhibitors. Constrictor sensitivity to GENENOTIN was enhanced in arteries from IH-exposed rats. Inhibition of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN blunted GENENOTIN constriction in arteries from IH but not sham group rats. Western analysis revealed similar levels of total and GENENOTIN in arteries from sham and IH group rats but decreased protein-protein interaction between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in arteries from IH- compared with sham-exposed rats. Blood pressure was increased in rats exposed to IH, and treatment with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN] (33 mg/day) lowered blood pressure in IH but not sham group rats. Our results suggest that exposure to IH unmasks a role for GENENOTIN in regulating GENENOTIN constrictor sensitivity and blood pressure that is not present under normal conditions. These novel findings suggest that GENENOTIN may be a uniquely effective antihypertensive therapy for OSA patients.
23097088	GENENOTIN is involved in apical ectoplasmic specialization dynamics during spermatogenesis in the rat. In this study, we investigated the role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in the testis. GENENOTIN is a cell adhesion protein having important roles in cell migration, especially during inflammation when leukocytes cross the endothelium. Herein, we showed GENENOTIN to be expressed by germ and Sertoli cells in the rat testis. When a monospecific antibody was used for immunolocalization experiments, GENENOTIN was found to surround the heads of elongating/elongated spermatids in all stages of the seminiferous epithelial cycle. To determine whether GENENOTIN is a constituent of apical ectoplasmic specialization (ES), co-immunoprecipitation and dual immunofluorescence staining were performed. Interestingly, GENENOTIN was found to associate with GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. Following CHEMICALIN treatment, GENEIN was found to be upregulated during restructuring of the seminiferous epithelium, with round spermatids becoming increasingly immunoreactive for GENENOTIN by 6-16 h. Interestingly, there was a loss in the binding of GENEIN to GENEIN during CHEMICALIN-induced germ cell loss, suggesting that a loss of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interactions might have facilitated junction restructuring. Taken collectively, these results illustrate that GENENOTIN plays an important role in apical ES dynamics during spermatogenesis.
23098818	The catalytic competence of GENEIN in the synthesis of CHEMICALIN from CHEMICALIN in the brain: an in vitro study. Brain CHEMICALNOTIN has been implicated in the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders, as well as in the mechanism of action of psychotropic drugs. The aim of present study was to identify GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) isoforms which can catalyze the CHEMICALNOTIN-demethylation of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN, and to find out whether that alternative pathway of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis may take place in the brain. The study was conducted on cDNA-expressed GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), on rat brain and liver microsomes and on human liver microsomes (the wild-type GENENOTIN or the allelic variant GENENOTIN*4*4). Of the GENENOTIN isoforms studied, GENEIN isoforms were the most efficient in catalyzing the CHEMICALIN-demethylation of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN, but they were less effective than the GENEIN. Microsomes from different brain regions were capable of metabolizing CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN. The reaction was inhibited by the specific GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Human liver microsomes of the wild-type GENEIN metabolized CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN more effectively than did the defective GENEIN*4*4 ones. The obtained results indicate that GENEIN isoforms catalyze the formation of CHEMICALIN from CHEMICALIN, and that the deficit or genetic defect of GENEIN may affect CHEMICALIN metabolism in the brain. The results are discussed in the context of their possible physiological and pharmacological significance in vivo.
23103568	GENENOTIN signaling as a target for novel breast cancer therapeutics. In breast cancer (BC) epithelial cells, the mitogenic action of CHEMICALIN is transduced through binding to two receptors, GENEIN and GENEIN, which act as transcription factors. Anti-CHEMICALNOTIN (AEs) and GENENOTIN inhibitors (AIs) are used clinically to arrest the CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent growth of BC. In the case of AE or AI resistance, Herceptin or CHEMICALNOTIN may be used to inhibit growth factors. CHEMICALIN effects are mediated not only through nuclear GENEIN but also through cytoplasmic/membrane GENEIN and GENEIN-coupled GENEIN. These CHEMICALNOTIN-binding systems associate with various proteins that direct cell cycle signaling, proliferation and survival. The partners of nuclear GENENOTIN include GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN itself as well as newly identified proteins, such as GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The partners of extra-nuclear GENENOTIN include GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. These various factors are all potential targets for therapeutic intervention. In addition, BC proliferation is enhanced by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, which stimulate signaling through the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathways by activation of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN axes, respectively. These pathways are tightly interconnected with GENENOTIN-activated signaling, and membrane GENENOTIN forms complexes with GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN-mediated signaling also modulates the CHEMICALNOTIN response. Inhibiting these pathways with specific inhibitors or activating some of the pathways by gene manipulation may be therapeutically valuable for arresting BC cell cycle progression and for inducing apoptosis to antagonize hormone-resistance. Here, we review some newly identified putatively targetable GENENOTIN partners and highlight the need to develop tumor-targeting drug carrier systems affecting both the tumor cells and the tumor environment.
23111283	CHEMICALIN induces apoptosis through suppression of GENEIN signaling pathway in HL-60 cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a CHEMICALNOTIN isolated from Melia toosendan Sieb. et Zucc., has been found to suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis in a variety of human cancer cells. However, the mechanism how CHEMICALNOTIN induces apoptosis remains poorly understood. In this study, we examined the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the growth, cell cycle arrest, induction of apoptosis and the involved signaling pathway in human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells. Proliferation of HL-60 cells was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with the IC(50 (48 h)) of 28 ng/mL. The growth inhibition was due primarily to the S phase arrest and cell apoptosis. Cell apoptosis induced by CHEMICALNOTIN was confirmed by Annexin V-CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN staining. The increase of the pro-apoptotic protein GENENOTIN, cleaved GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and the decrease of anti-apoptotic protein GENENOTIN were observed. Western blot analysis indicated that CHEMICALIN inhibits the GENEIN/GENEIN/GENEIN pathway. Taken together, our study suggested, for the first time, that the pro-apoptotic effects of CHEMICALIN on HL-60 cells were mediated through GENEIN signaling pathway.
23115221	Novel insights on the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in a murine colitis model. Studies showed that CHEMICALNOTIN has a positive influence on symptoms of ulcerative colitis. In the present study, we explored the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment using different routes of administration in the dextran CHEMICALNOTIN (DSS) colitis mouse model. We also investigated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, a major metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN, in the model. C57BL6 adult male mice were given DSS solution freely in the drinking water for seven consecutive days, and tap water was given thereafter. Disease severity, length of the colon, colon tissue histology, and inflammatory markers, including GENENOTIN activity and GENENOTIN levels, were evaluated. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN treatments via various different routes of administration were examined the DSS model. In addition, we measured the plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in our treatment protocols. Administration of low, but not high, doses of oral CHEMICALIN in DSS-treated mice resulted in a significant decrease in disease severity, histologic damage scores, as well as colonic level of GENEIN. However, the anti-inflammatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was not seen after chronic s.c. or minipump infusion of the drug. Differences in plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN do not seem to account for this lack of effect. Finally, oral CHEMICALNOTIN alone failed to show a significant effect in the DSS model of colitis. These results highlight that dose and route of administration play a critical role in the protective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in the DSS mouse colitis model.
23117207	The GENENOTIN mutation of GENENOTIN links GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signalling to Paget's disease of bone. Mutations affecting the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) gene commonly occur in patients with the skeletal disorder Paget's disease of bone (PDB), a condition characterised by defective osteoclast differentiation and function. Whilst most mutations cluster within the GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN protein, and are associated with dysregulated GENENOTIN signalling, several non-GENENOTIN mutations have also been identified. GENENOTIN is a GENENOTIN-interacting protein that regulates the levels and activity of the GENENOTIN transcription factor. This in turn controls the expression of numerous cytoprotective genes that contribute to the cell's capacity to defend itself against chemical and oxidative stress, through binding to the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The PDB-associated GENENOTIN mutation maps to the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of GENENOTIN, however the effects of PDB mutant GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN function have not been investigated. Here we show that unlike other GENENOTIN mutations, the GENENOTIN mutation results in neither impaired GENENOTIN-binding function in pull-down assays, nor dysregulated GENENOTIN signalling in luciferase reporter assays. GENENOTIN is expressed in differentiating osteoclast-like cells and the GENENOTIN mutation selectively impairs the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interaction in co-immunoprecipitations, which molecular modelling indicates results from effects on critical CHEMICALIN bonds required to stabilise the GENEIN-GENEIN complex. Further, GENENOTIN mutant GENENOTIN, but not other PDB-associated mutants, showed reduced ability to activate GENENOTIN signalling as assessed by GENENOTIN-luciferase reporter assays. Thus, GENENOTIN-mediated dysregulation of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN axis, which could potentially lead to aberrant production of oxidative response genes, may contribute to disease aetiology in a subset of PDB patients.
23117790	GENENOTIN suppresses postischemic CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance and neuronal damage through hypothalamic GENENOTIN. GENEIN (a CHEMICALIN-sensing neuropeptide in the hypothalamus) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN; a member of the GENENOTIN family) play roles in many physiologic functions, including regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. We previously showed that the development of postischemic CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance is one of the triggers of ischemic neuronal damage. The aim of this study was to determine whether there was an interaction between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN functions in the hypothalamus after cerebral ischemic stress. Male ddY mice were subjected to 2 hours of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO). Neuronal damage was estimated by histologic and behavioral analyses. Expression of protein levels was analyzed by Western blot. Small interfering RNA directed GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN; a specific GENEIN antagonist] were administered directly into the hypothalamus. The level of hypothalamic GENENOTIN, detected by immunohistochemistry, was decreased on day 1 after MCAO. Intrahypothalamic administration of GENENOTIN (1 or 5 pmol/mouse) significantly and dose-dependently suppressed the development of postischemic CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance on day 1 and development of neuronal damage on day 3. The MCAO-induced decrease in GENEIN levels in the liver and skeletal muscle on day 1 was recovered to control levels by GENENOTIN, and this effect of GENEIN was reversed by the administration of CHEMICALIN as well as by hypothalamic GENENOTIN knockdown. These results suggest that suppression of postischemic CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance by GENENOTIN assists in the prevention of cerebral ischemic neuronal damage. In addition, hypothalamic GENENOTIN may play an important role in this effect of GENENOTIN.
23146664	CHEMICALIN modulates intercellular adhesion through inhibition of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is widely used for the treatment of ulcerative colitis, a remitting condition characterized by chronic inflammation of the colon. Knowledge about the molecular and cellular targets of CHEMICALNOTIN is limited and a clear understanding of its activity in intestinal homeostasis and interference with neoplastic progression is lacking. We sought to identify molecular pathways interfered by CHEMICALNOTIN, using CRC cell lines with different genetic background. Microarray was performed for gene expression profile of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated and untreated cells (HCT116 and HT29). Filtering and analysis of data identified three oncogenic pathways interfered by CHEMICALIN: GENEIN/GENEIN pathway, cell adhesion and GENEIN/GENEIN signaling. GENEIN emerged as a consensus target of CHEMICALIN, orchestrating these pathways. We further investigated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on cell adhesion. CHEMICALNOTIN increased cell adhesion which was measured by cell adhesion assay and transcellular-resistance measurement. Moreover, CHEMICALIN treatment restored membranous expression of adhesion molecules GENEIN and GENEIN. Role of GENENOTIN as a mediator of mesalamine activity was validated in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of GENENOTIN by RNA interference also increased cell adhesion. GENEIN expression was elevated in APC(min) polyps and CHEMICALIN treatment reduced its expression. Our data demonstrates novel pharmacological mechanism of CHEMICALIN in modulation of cell adhesion and role of GENEIN in APC(min) polyposis. We propose that inhibition of GENEIN expression by CHEMICALIN can impede with neoplastic progression in colorectal carcinogenesis. The mechanism of GENEIN inhibition and induction of membranous translocation of adhesion proteins by CHEMICALIN might be independent of its known anti-inflammatory action.
23146761	Cholestatic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in rats is mediated via decreased expression of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been shown to be protective in various experimental models of liver injury, although opposite effects have also been reported. Since its effect on biliary physiology has not been thoroughly investigated, the present study evaluated effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on bile flow and CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis in rats. Compared to controls, CHEMICALNOTIN treatment decreased bile flow by 23%. Hepatic paracellular permeability and biliary CHEMICALNOTIN excretion were not altered by CHEMICALNOTIN administration, but biliary CHEMICALNOTIN excretion was reduced by 70%. Accordingly, the main GENENOTIN on the hepatocyte canalicular membrane, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), was significantly decreased at the protein level. CHEMICALNOTIN administration also doubled plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels compared to controls. While protein levels of the main GENENOTIN were unchanged, the rate-limiting enzyme in the CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis, GENENOTIN, was significantly increased by CHEMICALNOTIN. Enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis in these animals was also confirmed by a 2-fold increase in plasma marker CHEMICALNOTIN. In contrast, CHEMICALIN markedly downregulated major GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN) and regulatory molecules (GENEIN and GENEIN) in the ileum. When CHEMICALNOTIN was coadministered with CHEMICALNOTIN, a potent cholestatic agent, it did not show any additional effect on the induced cholestasis. This study shows ability of CHEMICALIN to raise plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations, mainly through GENEIN upregulation, and to decrease bile production through reduction in GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN-independent bile flow. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that under certain conditions CHEMICALNOTIN may induce cholestasis.
23147987	Effects-based marine ecological risk assessment at a polychlorinated biphenyl-contaminated site in Saglek, Labrador, Canada. Although the presence and distribution of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in Arctic marine environments has been well documented, the implications for the health of biota are poorly understood. In the present study, multiple lines of evidence, including site-specific effects data, were used to assess PCB-related risks to marine biota at a contaminated military site in Saglek Bay, Labrador, Canada, from 1997 to 1999. Risks were evaluated for three components of the ecosystem: benthic invertebrates, a bottom-feeding fish (shorthorn sculpin, Myoxocephalus scorpius), and a diving seabird (black guillemot, Cepphus grylle). Average sediment PCB concentrations exceeded the Canadian interim sediment quality guideline level by 41-fold. However, sediment toxicity testing and a benthic community survey showed no evidence of adverse effects. In contrast, shorthorn sculpin and black guillemot PCB exposures (measured as sum of 55 congeners) were elevated enough to pose risks to survival or reproduction. Based on the collective evidence, the authors estimated that risks were posed by sediment PCB concentrations greater than 77 ng/g dry weight for black guillemots and 750 ng/g dry weight for shorthorn sculpins. The present study, along with two parallel studies, provided information to support the management decisions concerning potential remedial action on the contaminated sediments. This ecological risk assessment describes the steps and rationale taken to evaluate the risk posed by an area of PCB-contaminated marine sediments in an otherwise relatively pristine northern coastal environment.
23150495	Ablation of Egr2-positive cells in male mouse anterior pituitary leads to atypical isolated GH deficiency. In this study, we have investigated the expression and function of the transcription factor early growth response factor 2 (Egr2)/Krox20 in the developing anterior pituitary. Egr2 is initially expressed in all differentiating hormonal cells types, but its expression is mostly restricted to the somatotroph lineage after birth. Egr2 knockout results in anterior pituitary hypoplasia. However, the analysis of a conditional mutant demonstrates that this phenotype does not originate from a lack of Egr2 expression in the pituitary. Using an Egr2 allele driving a Cre-activable toxin gene, we performed a genetic ablation of Egr2-positive cells in the pituitary. During the postnatal period, this ablation leads to specific and progressive depletion of the somatotroph population, creating a novel model of early-onset isolated GH deficiency (GHD). Mutant animals were subjected to a complete metabolic analysis, revealing atypical and expected features. Consistent with an adult-onset isolated GHD model, mutant animals are hypoglycemic and display increased insulin sensitivity and glucose clearance. This latter phenotype is in contrast to the glucose intolerance observed in another early-onset GHD model. Surprisingly, increased insulin sensitivity is not accompanied by a modified balance between fat and lean tissues, but by reduced metabolic adaptability between glucose and lipid oxidation conditions. This suggests that the relationship between these metabolic features and insulin sensitivity should be reconsidered. In conclusion, our mutant may be a valuable genetic model with which to study the effects of long-term GH deficiency, in conditions of normal pancreatic function and unaffected balance between fat and glucose metabolism.
23155201	The scintigraphic evaluation and genetic correlation of joint involvements in pediatric patients with familial Mediterranean fever. Purpose: We aimed to evaluate the articular involvements in pediatric patients with familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) with joint symptoms by bone scintigraphy and to correlate the involved joints with the gene mutations. Materials and methods: A total of 41 newly diagnosed patients in pediatric age group (28 girls and 13 boys; mean age 9.14 ± 2.91 years) with joint involvement symptoms were included in this study. Scintigraphic images were obtained at 5th min (blood pool or early phase) and starting at 3 h (late phase) after (after tracer injection) intravenous administration of technetium-99m (99mTc)-methylendiphosphonate (MDP). Genomic DNA was isolated from leukocytes using standard salting out procedure. The sequencing data were analyzed. Results: Of the 41 patients, arthritis was found in 21 (51.2%) patients. Of the 21 patients, there was single joint involvement in 15 (71.4%) patients and multiple joint involvement in six (28.6%) patients. The mean age of patients with joint involvement (8 ± 2.3 years) were considerably lower than the patients without joint involvement (10.35 ± 3.04 years), and this was statistically significant (p = 0.008). The most commonly involved joints were ankles and knees. Multiple joint involvements were most frequently observed in the M694V and M694I gene mutations (16.7%). Conclusions: We use and recommend the bone scintigraphy in patients with FMF to determine the presence and distribution of arthritis, since bone scintigraphy is inexpensive, noninvasive, easy-to-use, and also is more sensitive in the diagnosis and distribution of arthritis than conventional radiological methods and clinical examination.
23157629	GENENOTIN of type 6 (GENENOTIN): from neuroscience to clinical pharmacology. The GENEIN of type 6 (GENEIN) are quite different from all other GENENOTIN, as they include a short third cytoplasmatic loop and a long CHEMICALIN-terminal tail, and one intron located in the middle of the third cytoplasmatic loop. A lot of controversies still exist regarding their binding affinity, effects of GENENOTIN ligands on brain CHEMICALNOTIN, behavioral syndromes regulated by them, and brain distribution. In spite of the lack of information on metabolic pattern of the various compounds, some of GENENOTIN receptor ligands entered the clinical development as potential anti-dementia, antipsychotic, antidepressant and anti-obese drugs. The present paper is a comprehensive review on the state of art of the GENENOTIN receptors, while highlighting the potential clinical applications of GENENOTIN receptor agonists/antagonists.
23159887	Expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in fast- and slow-twitch muscles: A signaling pathway to account for the synaptic expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of GENENOTIN at the rat neuromuscular junction. The gene encoding the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) contains two distinct promoters that drive the production of two GENENOTIN mRNAs, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, in slow- and fast-twitch muscles, respectively. GENEIN is expressed at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in fast-twitch muscle, and this expression depends on trophic factors supplied by motor neurons signaling via a CHEMICALIN-dependent pathway in muscle. To further elucidate the molecular basis of GENENOTIN synaptic expression, here we investigated the expression and localization of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) at the synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of fast- and slow-twitch muscles from adult rats. The total amount of active, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) present in slow-twitch soleus muscle was higher than that in fast-twitch tibialis muscle, but GENENOTIN was predominantly expressed in the fast-twitch muscle at NMJs. In contrast, GENENOTIN was detected in both synaptic and extra-synaptic regions of slow-twitch muscle. These results reveal, for the first time, the differential distribution of GENENOTIN in fast- and slow-twitch muscles, which might support the crucial role of CHEMICALIN-dependent signaling in controlling the synapse-specific expression of GENEIN in fast-twitch muscles.
23159888	Analysis of mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5): characterisation of rat ADH5 with comparisons to the corresponding human variant. Alcohol dehydrogenase 5 (ADH5) is a member of the mammalian alcohol dehydrogenase family of yet undefined functions. ADH5 was first identified at the DNA level in human and deer mouse. A rat alcohol dehydrogenase structure of similar type has been isolated at the cDNA level using human ADH5 as a screening probe, where the rat cDNA structure displayed several atypical properties. mRNA for rat ADH5 was found in multiple tissues, especially in the kidney. In vitro translation experiments indicated that rat ADH5 is expressed as efficiently as ADH1 and furthermore, rat ADH5 was readily expressed in COS cells fused to Green Fluorescent Protein. However, no soluble ADH5 protein could be heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli cells with expression systems successfully used for other mammalian ADHs, including fused to glutathione-S-transferase. Molecular modelling of the enzyme indicated that the protein does not fold in a productive way, which can be the explanation why no stable and active ADH5 has been isolated. These results indicate that ADH5, while readily expressed at the mRNA level, does not behave similarly to other mammalian ADHs investigated. The results, in vitro and in silico, suggest an unstable ADH5 structure, which can explain for why no active and stable protein can be isolated. Further possibilities are conceivable: the ADH5 protein may have to interact with a stabiliser, or the gene is actually a pseudogene.
23161844	Combining quantum mechanical ligand conformation analysis and protein modeling to elucidate GPCR-ligand binding modes. SAR beyond protein-ligand interactions: By combining structure-affinity relationships, protein-ligand modeling studies, and quantum mechanical calculations, we show that ligand conformational energies and basicity play critical roles in ligand binding to the histamine H4 receptor, a GPCR that plays a key role in inflammation.
23164921	CHEMICALIN inhibits LPS plus GENEIN-induced inflammatory response in astrocytes primary cultures. A large body of evidence suggests that the inflammatory reaction plays an important role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Our previous studies described the neuroprotective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory models, in which CHEMICALNOTIN was shown to prevent mesencephalic neuron death and ameliorate cognitive ability animals. To further investigate the protective effect and underlying mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN, astrocytes were pretreated with low (0.1mM) and high dose (0.5mM) CHEMICALNOTIN for 1h prior to LPS plus GENENOTIN stimulation. Biochemical analyses showed that CHEMICALNOTIN and ROS production and GENEIN activity were significantly reduced by CHEMICALIN. Data at transcriptional level also demonstrated that CHEMICALIN potently attenuated gene expressions involved in inflammation, such as GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN. In addition, our exploration further revealed that the suppressive action of CHEMICALIN on inflammation was mediated via inhibiting GENEIN (GENEIN) activation. Collectively, these results suggest that CHEMICALIN can exert inhibitory effects on the inflammatory reaction in astrocytes and that inactivation of GENEIN could be the major determinant for its anti-inflammatory mechanism. Therefore, CHEMICALNOTIN may potentially be a highly effective therapeutic agent in treating neurodegenerative diseases associated with inflammation.
23172229	Cardiolipin-dependent reconstitution of respiratory supercomplexes from purified Saccharomyces cerevisiae complexes III and IV. Here, we report for the first time in vitro reconstitution of the respiratory supercomplexes from individual complexes III and IV. Complexes III and IV were purified from Saccharomyces cerevisiae mitochondria. Complex III contained eight molecules of cardiolipin, and complex IV contained two molecules of cardiolipin, as determined by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. Complex IV also contained Rcf1p. No supercomplexes were formed upon mixing of the purified complexes, and low amounts of the supercomplex trimer III(2)IV(1) were formed after reconstitution into proteoliposomes containing only phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. Further addition of cardiolipin to the proteoliposome reconstitution mixture resulted in distinct formation of both the III(2)IV(1) supercomplex trimer and III(2)IV(2) supercomplex tetramer. No other anionic phospholipid was as effective as cardiolipin in supporting tetramer formation. Phospholipase treatment of complex IV prevented trimer formation in the absence of cardiolipin. Both trimer and tetramer formations were restored by cardiolipin. Analysis of the reconstituted tetramer by single particle electron microscopy confirmed native organization of individual complexes within the supercomplex. In conclusion, although some trimer formation occurred dependent only on tightly bound cardiolipin, tetramer formation required additional cardiolipin. This is consistent with the high cardiolipin content in the native tetramer. The dependence on cardiolipin for supercomplex formation suggests that changes in cardiolipin levels resulting from changes in physiological conditions may control the equilibrium between individual respiratory complexes and supercomplexes in vivo.
23177789	GENEIN inhibitory effect by CHEMICALIN-type CHEMICALIN from hydrolyzate of total Gynostemma pentaphyllum CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is an important factor in non-GENENOTIN-dependent diabetes mellitus (type-2 diabetes), and a promising target for treatment of diabetes and obesity. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the inhibitory activities of constituents (three new together with twelve known CHEMICALNOTIN compounds) isolated from the hydrolyzate of total CHEMICALNOTIN from Gynostemma pentaphyllum. Their structures were accomplished mainly base on the spectroscopic methods, and then were further confirmed by X-ray crystal diffraction. All the compounds were evaluated for inhibitory activity against GENENOTIN. Current data suggested that the compounds 1, 3, 12, 13 and 14 were considered to be potential as antidiabetic agents, in which they could significantly inhibit the GENENOTIN enzyme activity in a dose-dependent manner.
23182946	Disrupted cytoskeletal homeostasis, astrogliosis and apoptotic cell death in the cerebellum of preweaning rats injected with CHEMICALNOTIN. In the present report 15 day-old rats were injected with 0.3μmol of CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN/kg body weight and parameters of neurodegeneration were analyzed in slices from cerebellum 3 and 6 days afterwards. The earlier responses, at day 3 after injection, included hyperphosphorylation of intermediate filament (IF) proteins from astrocyte (GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN - and GENENOTIN) and neuron (GENENOTIN: GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN); increased GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activities. Also, reactive astrogliosis takes part of the early responses to the insult with CHEMICALIN, evidenced by upregulated GENEIN in Western blot, PCR and immunofluorescence analysis. Six days after CHEMICALNOTIN injection we found persistent astrogliosis, increased CHEMICALNOTIN (PI) positive cells in GENENOTIN positive population evidenced by flow cytometry and reduced immunofluorescence for GENEIN, suggesting that the in vivo exposure to CHEMICALIN progressed to neuronal death. Moreover, activated GENENOTIN suggested apoptotic neuronal death. Neurodegeneration was related with decreased CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and decreased GENEIN immunoreactivity, however GENEIN (CHEMICALIN9) was not altered in CHEMICALIN injected rat. Therefore, the present results show that the earlier cerebellar responses to CHEMICALIN include disruption of cytoskeletal homeostasis that could be related with GENEIN and GENEIN activation and reactive astrogliosis. GENENOTIN inhibition observed at this time could also play a role in the neuronal death evidenced afterwards. The later events of the neurodegenerative process are characterized by persistent astrogliosis and activation of apoptotic neuronal death through GENENOTIN mediated mechanisms, which could be related with CHEMICALNOTIN excitotoxicity. The progression of these responses are therefore likely to be critical for the outcome of the neurodegeneration provoked by CHEMICALNOTIN in rat cerebellum.
23194529	The presence of D-fagomine in the human diet from buckwheat-based foodstuffs. Buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) groats contain the iminosugar D-fagomine as a minor component that might contribute to the alleged health benefits of this pseudo-cereal. This study presents analysis of D-fagomine in buckwheat-based foodstuffs by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and an estimation of its presence in the human diet based on a published population-based cross-sectional nutrition survey. D-fagomine is present in common buckwheat-based foodstuffs in amounts ranging from 1 to 25 mg/kg or mg/L, it is stable during boiling, baking, frying and fermentation, and it is biosynthesised upon sprouting. The estimated total intake of D-fagomine resulting from a diet that includes such foodstuffs would be between 3 and 17 mg per day (mean for both genders; range from P5 to P95). A diet rich in buckwheat products would provide a daily amount of D-fagomine that may in part explain the beneficial properties traditionally attributed to buckwheat consumption.
23198810	Profluorogenic reductase substrate for rapid, selective, and sensitive visualization and detection of human cancer cells that overexpress GENENOTIN. Achieving the vision of identifying and quantifying cancer-related events and targets for future personalized oncology is predicated on the existence of synthetically accessible and economically viable probe molecules fully able to report the presence of these events and targets in a rapid and highly selective and sensitive fashion. Delineated here are the design and evaluation of a newly synthesized turn-on probe whose intense fluorescent reporter signature is revealed only through probe activation by a specific intracellular enzyme present in tumor cells of multiple origins. Quenching of molecular probe fluorescence is achieved through unique photoinduced electron transfer between the CHEMICALNOTIN dye reporter and a covalently attached, CHEMICALNOTIN-based enzyme substrate. Fluorescence of the reporter dye is turned on by rapid removal of the CHEMICALNOTIN quencher, an event that immediately occurs only after highly selective, two-electron reduction of the sterically and conformationally restricted CHEMICALIN substrate by the cancer-associated GENEIN (GENEIN). Successes of the approach include rapid differentiation of GENENOTIN-expressing and -nonexpressing cancer cell lines via the unaided eye, flow cytometry, fluorescence imaging, and two-photon microscopy. The potential for use of the turn-on probe in longer-term cellular studies is indicated by its lack of influence on cell viability and its in vitro stability.
23199028	Synthesis, biological evaluation, and molecular modeling of CHEMICALIN derivatives as potent GENEIN inhibitors with anti-heart-failure activity in vivo. Novel CHEMICALNOTIN (GL) derivatives were designed and synthesized by introducing various CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN residues into the CHEMICALNOTIN chain and at C-30. Their inhibitory effects on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were evaluated using a cell-based lipopolysaccharide (LPS) induced GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) release study. Compounds 10, 12, 18-20, 23, and 24, which had substituents introduced at C-30, demonstrated moderate GENENOTIN inhibition with ED₅₀ values ranging from 337 to 141 μM, which are values comparable to that of the leading GL compound (1) (ED₅₀ = 70 μM). Compounds 23 and 24 emerged as novel and interesting GENENOTIN inhibitors. These compounds were able to extend the survival of mice with chronic heart failure (CHF) and acute heart failure (AHF), respectively. In addition, molecular modeling studies were performed to support the biological data.
23200253	Further exploration of M₁ allosteric agonists: subtle structural changes abolish M₁ allosteric agonism and result in pan-GENENOTIN orthosteric antagonism. This letter describes the further exploration of two series of M(1) allosteric agonists, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, previously reported from our lab. Within the CHEMICALIN scaffold, either electronic or steric perturbations to the central CHEMICALIN ring led to a loss of selective M(1) allosteric agonism and afforded pan-GENEIN antagonism, which was demonstrated to be mediated via the orthosteric site. Additional SAR around a related M(1) allosteric agonist family (CHEMICALIN) identified similar, subtle 'molecular switches' that modulated modes of pharmacology from allosteric agonism to pan-GENEIN orthosteric antagonism. Therefore, all of these ligands are best classified as bi-topic ligands that possess high affinity binding at an allosteric site to engender selective M(1) activation, but all bind, at higher concentrations, to the orthosteric ACh site, leading to non-selective orthosteric site binding and GENENOTIN antagonism.
23205514	Effects of single or repeated silymarin administration on pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN and its major metabolite, CHEMICALNOTIN in rats. 1. The interactions between herbal dietary supplements and therapeutic drugs have emerged as an important issue and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has been reported as one of the significant factors of these interactions. 2. The objective of this article is to examine the effects of single and repeated administrations of silymarin on pharmacokinetics of a GENEIN substrate, CHEMICALIN, and its major metabolite, CHEMICALIN, in rats. 3. To determine the plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in rats, a HPLC method was developed using a liquid-liquid acid back extraction. When CHEMICALNOTIN (6 mg/kg) was co-administered with silymarin (40 mg/kg) to rats orally, the C(max) of CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly increased to1.3-fold (p < 0.05), while the other pharmacokinetic parameters did not show any significant differences. Expanding the experiment where rats were repeatedly administered with silymarin for 5 days prior to giving CHEMICALNOTIN, the C(max) of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were significantly increased to 2.4-fold (p < 0.001) and 1.7-fold (p < 0.001), respectively, and the AUC(0-t), as well to 1.7-fold (p < 0.05) and 2.1-fold (p < 0.01), respectively. 4. The repeated exposures of silymarin, compared to single administration of silymarin, increased oral bioavailability and affected the pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, by inhibiting GENENOTIN.
23205571	Design, synthesis and structure-activity relationship of new CHEMICALNOTIN analogues containing CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives in position 2. In this study, we present the synthesis and pharmacological properties of new analogues of GENEIN modified in the CHEMICALIN-terminal part of the molecule with CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives: CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN. All the peptides were tested for pressor, antidiuretic and in vitro uterotonic activities. We also determined their binding affinity to the GENENOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN(2) substitution resulted in two moderately potent and selective antioxytocic agents: CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (pA(2) = 7.09 and 7.50, respectively). On the other hand, peptides modified with CHEMICALIN, apart from their moderate antioxytocic activity, turned out to be weak antagonists of the pressor response to GENEIN. The results of this study provide useful information about the structure-activity relationship of CHEMICALNOTIN analogues and can help to design compounds with desired biological properties.
23211426	GENENOTIN and female reproduction: when CHEMICALNOTIN meets fertility! The role of CHEMICALNOTIN in female reproductive physiology has been suspected for a long time, while the molecular bases were unknown. CHEMICALNOTIN is the precursor of ovarian CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis and is also essential for fertility. In the uterus, CHEMICALNOTIN is essential to achieve correct contractions at term, but an excessive uterine CHEMICALNOTIN concentration has been associated with contractility defects. GENEIN and GENEIN are nuclear receptors activated by CHEMICALIN, oxidized derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN. Since their discovery, the role of GENENOTIN in the control of CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis has been widely described. Beyond their CHEMICALNOTIN-lowering role, more recent data have linked these nuclear receptors to various physiological processes. In particular, they control ovarian endocrine and exocrine functions, as well as uterine contractility. Their contribution to female reproductive cancers will also be discussed. This review will try to enlighten on the GENENOTIN as a molecular link between dietary CHEMICALNOTIN and reproductive diseases in women. In the future, a better comprehension of the various physiological processes regulated by the GENENOTIN will help to develop new ligands to prevent or to cure these pathologies in women.
23211523	GENENOTIN regulates CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN gene expression. The regulation of GENENOTIN synthesis by GENENOTIN plays an essential role in the neuroendocrine control of reproduction. The known signaling mechanisms involved in GENENOTIN synthesis have been expanding. For example, involvement of GENEIN in LHβ induction by CHEMICALIN has been discovered. We examined the role of GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN gene expression in LβT2 gonadotrope cells. CHEMICALIN caused a sustained increase in nuclear GENEIN levels, which was significantly reduced by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibition. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of GENENOTIN mRNA demonstrated that induction of GENEIN mRNA by CHEMICALIN depended on GENENOTIN and that regulation of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN occurred independently of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN pathway. GENENOTIN depletion had no impact on GENENOTIN mRNA stability. In LβT2 cells transfected with GENENOTIN luciferase fusion constructs, GENENOTIN responsiveness was conferred by the proximal promoter (-944/-1) and was markedly decreased by GENENOTIN knockdown. However, none of the GENENOTIN in that region were required for promoter activation by GENENOTIN. Chromatin immunoprecipitation further corroborated the absence of direct interaction between GENENOTIN and the 1.8-kb GENENOTIN. To elucidate the mechanism for the GENENOTIN effect, we analyzed approximately 1 billion reads of next-generation RNA sequencing GENENOTIN knockdown assays and selected the nuclear cofactor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as one candidate for further study. Subsequent experiments confirmed that GENENOTIN mRNA expression was decreased by GENENOTIN knockdown as well as by GENENOTIN inhibition. Furthermore, knockdown of GENENOTIN significantly attenuated CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN expression. Thus, our findings indicate that the expression of GENENOTIN depends on GENENOTIN activity and contributes to GENEIN induction by CHEMICALIN.
23220037	CHEMICALNOTIN decreases CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation and toxicity in Caco-2 cells. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is an GENENOTIN belonging to the GENENOTIN superfamily expressed in several organs. Considering its potential protective effects, the induction of de novo synthesis of GENENOTIN could be used therapeutically in the treatment of intoxications by its substrates. The herbicide CHEMICALIN (PQ) is a GENEIN substrate responsible for thousands of fatal intoxications worldwide that still lacks an effective antidote. The aim of the present work was to evaluate the effectiveness of such an antidote by testing whether CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a known GENEIN inducer, could efficiently protect Caco-2 cells against PQ cytotoxicity, 6 h after the incubation with the herbicide, reflecting a real-life intoxication scenario. Cytotoxicity was evaluated by the CHEMICALNOTIN assay and PQ intracellular concentrations were measured by gas chromatography-ion trap-mass spectrometry (GC-IT-MS). Also, the CHEMICALNOTIN modulatory effect on CHEMICALNOTIN uptake transport system was assessed by measuring the uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN. The results show that CHEMICALNOTIN exerts protective effects against PQ cytotoxicity, preventing the intracellular accumulation of the herbicide. These protective effects were not completely prevented by the incubation with the UIC2 antibody, a specific GENENOTIN inhibitor, suggesting the involvement of alternative protection mechanisms. In fact, CHEMICALNOTIN also efficiently inhibited the CHEMICALNOTIN transport system that influences PQ cellular uptake. In conclusion, in this cellular model, CHEMICALIN effectively protects against PQ toxicity by inducing GENEIN and through the interaction with the GENEIN, suggesting that compounds presenting this double feature of promoting the efflux and limiting the uptake of PQ could be used as effective antidotes to treat intoxications.
23220641	Sirtuins as emerging anti-parasitic targets. Silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) enzymes or sirtuins are a family of NAD(+)-dependent protein N(ε)-acetyl-lysine (AcK) deacetylases. Sirtuins are also evolutionarily conserved proteins that are present in all kingdoms of life ranging from bacteria to humans. Interestingly, it was recently found that the sirtuins found in various human parasites (especially the Plasmodium, Trypanosoma, and Leishmania species) were pro-survival for the parasites under various conditions. Therefore, these parasitic sirtuins have emerged as novel anti-parasitic therapeutic targets. This article reviews the currently available structural, biochemical, pharmacological, and medicinal chemistry studies on these enzymes, and discusses the perspectives of selectively targeting the parasitic sirtuins as a novel therapeutic strategy for the human parasitic diseases.
23220742	The selective GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) inhibits B cell signaling and function in vitro and in vivo and augments the activity of CHEMICALNOTIN in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) associated GENENOTIN including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) contribute to the pathogenesis of B-cell malignancies. GENENOTIN is persistently phosphorylated in a subset of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), and GENENOTIN inhibition results in abrogation of downstream GENENOTIN activity and apoptosis. CHEMICALIN (also known as CHEMICALIN) is a novel, highly selective, and orally bioavailable small molecule GENEIN inhibitor (GENEIN IC(50) = 1 nM) with anti-GENEIN activity that is at least 80-fold greater than its affinity for other GENENOTIN. We evaluated the preclinical characteristics of CHEMICALNOTIN in models of NHL and CLL. CHEMICALIN successfully inhibited GENEIN-mediated GENEIN signaling and decreased cell viability in NHL and CLL. Oral dosing in mice prevented GENENOTIN-mediated splenomegaly and significantly inhibited NHL tumor growth in a xenograft model. In addition, combination treatment of primary CLL cells with CHEMICALNOTIN plus CHEMICALNOTIN produced synergistic enhancement of activity at nanomolar concentrations. Our findings support the ongoing development of CHEMICALNOTIN as a therapeutic agent for B-cell malignancies. A dose finding study in healthy volunteers has been completed.
23223234	The fidelity of transcription: GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mutations that increase transcriptional slippage in S. cerevisiae. The fidelity of RNA synthesis depends on both accurate template-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN selection and proper maintenance of register between template and RNA. Loss of register, or transcriptional slippage, is particularly likely on homopolymeric runs in the template. Transcriptional slippage can alter the coding capacity of mRNAs and is used as a regulatory mechanism. Here we describe mutations in the largest subunit of GENENOTIN that substantially increase the level of transcriptional slippage. Alleles of GENEIN (GENEIN) with elevated slippage rates were identified among CHEMICALIN-sensitive mutants and were also isolated using a slippage-dependent reporter gene. Biochemical characterization of GENENOTIN isolated from these mutants confirms elevated levels of transcriptional slippage.
23223414	Effect of nuclear vibrations, temperature, co-adsorbed water, and dye orientation on light absorption, charge injection and recombination conditions in organic dyes on TiO2. We study the effect of nuclear motions at different temperatures, including the effect of a dye molecule's orientation with respect to the oxide surface, on factors determining the performance of dye sensitized solar cells: light absorption, electron injection, and back-donation. We perform ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of aminophenyl acid dyes NK1 and NK7, differing by the electron donating group, in a vacuum and adsorbed in mono- and bi-dentate modes on a dry and a water-covered anatase (101) surface of TiO(2), at 300 and 350 K. Nuclear vibrations and an increase of temperature cause a red shift in the absorption spectra of free dyes. This effect is preserved in dyes on dry TiO(2) but largely disappears in the presence of water. Averaged over nuclear vibrations, the driving force to injection, ΔG, differs from the static estimate. It depends on the adsorption mode and the presence of H(2)O but is almost the same for 300 and 350 K. Recombination to the dye cation is expected to be much enhanced by the approach of the dye oxidation equivalent hole to the surface during dye wagging around TiO(2). This effect is somewhat mitigated by the co-adsorbed water. The dynamics of ΔG(t) are explained by uncorrelated evolution of the energies of the dye excited state and the conduction band minimum of the oxide due to their respective vibrations, and are almost independent of dye orientation. It may therefore be possible to independently control the conditions of recombination and of injection.
23224291	Proteomic and metabolomic responses to connexin43 silencing in primary hepatocyte cultures. Freshly established cultures of primary hepatocytes progressively adopt a foetal-like phenotype and display increased production of connexin43. The latter is a multifaceted cellular entity with variable subcellular locations, including the mitochondrial compartment. Cx43 forms hemichannels and gap junctions that are involved in a plethora of physiological and pathological processes, such as apoptosis. The present study was conducted with the goal of shedding more light onto the role of connexin43 in primary hepatocyte cultures. Connexin43 expression was suppressed by means of RNA interference technology, and the overall outcome of this treatment on the hepatocellular proteome and metabolome was investigated using tandem mass tag-based differential protein profiling and (1)H NMR spectroscopy, respectively. Global protein profiling revealed a number of targets of the connexin43 knock-down procedure, including mitochondrial proteins (heat shock protein 60, glucose-regulated protein 75, thiosulphate sulphurtransferase and adenosine triphosphate synthase) and detoxifying enzymes (glutathione S-transferase μ 2 and cytochrome P450 2C70). At the metabolomic level, connexin43 silencing caused no overt changes, though there was some evidence for a subtle increase in intracellular glycine quantities. Collectively, these data could further substantiate the established existence of a mitochondrial connexin pool and could be reconciled with the previously reported involvement of connexin43 signalling in spontaneously occurring apoptosis in primary hepatocyte cultures.
23229511	GENEIN is a target of CHEMICALIN and enhances its anticancer activity in lung adenocarcinoma cells. We have demonstrated that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (AD). GENENOTIN is usually associated with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in the cytoplasm. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an GENEIN inhibitor, is currently under evaluation for its anticancer activity in clinical trials. Here we investigated whether GENENOTIN plays a role in CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated anticancer activity by functioning as a downstream target or by modulating its anticancer efficacy. GENENOTIN expression in lung AD cells was modulated by siRNA interference or overexpression. Tumor growth was determined with colony formation in vitro or in vivo. Anticancer activity of CHEMICALNOTIN was determined by measuring cell viability, cell cycle distribution, and expression of cell cycle regulators. Proteins and mRNA levels were examined by immunoblotting and the real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. In this study, GENENOTIN overexpression positively modulated growth of lung AD cells, at least partially, via GENENOTIN-dependent mechanisms. Although treatment with CHEMICALIN reduced GENEIN levels and GENEIN-regulated gene expression in lung AD cells, GENENOTIN expression increased anticancer activity of CHEMICALNOTIN. In addition, CHEMICALIN treatment reduced cell viability, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN levels in GENENOTIN-expressing lung AD cells. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which is regulated by GENENOTIN, was shown to increase anticancer activity of CHEMICALNOTIN in cells. Knockdown of GENENOTIN expression attenuated the reduction of cell cycle regulators by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment in GENENOTIN overexpressed cells. We demonstrated that GENEIN protein not only functions as a downstream target of CHEMICALIN, but also enhances anticancer activity of CHEMICALNOTIN in lung AD cells.
23230131	Pharmacogenomics of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism: functional analysis of genetic variants in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is metabolized by GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN), but the contribution of genetic variation in these enzymes to the variability in systemic exposure and response observed in cancer patients is unclear. Wild-type enzymes and variants of GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN) were expressed in and purified from Escherichia coli, and enzyme kinetic parameters were estimated for CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN, and its metabolite CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) as substrates. All three GENEIN proteins showed similar K(m) and V(max) for CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN deamination, except for GENEIN70Thr, which had a 2.5-fold lower K(m) and 6-fold lower V(max) for CHEMICALIN deamination. All four GENEIN proteins yielded comparable metabolic activity for CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN monophosphorylation, except for GENEIN24Val, which demonstrated an approximately 2-fold increase (P < 0.05) in the intrinsic clearance of CHEMICALIN monophosphorylation due to a 40% decrease in K(m) (P < 0.05). GENEIN did not significantly contribute to CHEMICALIN monophosphorylation. In conclusion, the GENEIN substitution does not significantly modulate GENEIN activity toward CHEMICALIN, and therefore would not contribute to interindividual variability in response to CHEMICALIN. The higher in vitro catalytic efficiency of GENEIN24Val toward CHEMICALIN monophosphorylation may be relevant to CHEMICALIN clinical response. The substrate-dependent alterations in activities of GENENOTIN70Thr and GENENOTIN24Val in vitro were observed for the first time, and demonstrate that the in vivo consequences of these genetic variations should not be extrapolated from one substrate of these enzymes to another.
23232060	Discovery of CHEMICALIN based GENEIN inhibitors. A series of compounds based on a CHEMICALIN scaffold that are potent and selective inhibitors of GENEIN (GENEIN) activity are described. These compounds were used as tools to test the importance of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN activity in signaling and proliferation in GENENOTIN-activated colorectal cancer cells. The results indicate that pharmacological inhibition of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN activity has minimal effects on either GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-driven transcription or viability. The findings suggest that the GENENOTIN activity of GENENOTIN may be less important to GENENOTIN signaling than other aspects of GENENOTIN function, such as its putative role in stabilizing the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN transcriptional complex.
23234537	Hybrid carbon nanotube networks as efficient hole extraction layers for organic photovoltaics. Transparent, highly percolated networks of regioregular poly(3-hexylthiophene) (rr-P3HT)-wrapped semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (s-SWNTs) are deposited, and the charge transfer processes of these nanohybrids are studied using spectroscopic and electrical measurements. The data disclose hole doping of s-SWNTs by the polymer, challenging the prevalent electron-doping hypothesis. Through controlled fabrication, high- to low-density nanohybrid networks are achieved, with low-density hybrid carbon nanotube networks tested as hole transport layers (HTLs) for bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic photovoltaics (OPV). OPVs incorporating these rr-P3HT/s-SWNT networks as the HTL demonstrate the best large area (70 mm(2)) carbon nanotube incorporated organic solar cells to date with a power conversion efficiency of 7.6%. This signifies the strong capability of nanohybrids as an efficient hole extraction layer, and we believe that dense nanohybrid networks have the potential to replace expensive and material scarce inorganic transparent electrodes in large area electronics toward the realization of low-cost flexible electronics.
23238236	Chemical assessment and antioxidant capacity of pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) seeds. Capsicum annuum L. is reported to be the most widely cultivated species. Recently, waste of vegetable processing, like seeds, has been the subject of many studies as an attempt to find new, alternative and cheap resources of bioactive compounds with application in several industries. Despite their chemical, biological and ecological importance, C. annuum seeds are still poorly studied. To improve the knowledge on the metabolic profile of this matrix, a targeted metabolite analysis was performed in "sweet Italian" and "Reus long pairal" pepper seeds. Sterols, triterpenes, organic acids, fatty acids and volatile compounds were determined by different chromatographic methods. The antioxidant activity was assessed against DPPH(·), superoxide and nitric oxide radicals. A concentration-dependent activity was noticed against all radicals. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitory capacity was also evaluated, but no effect was found. Data provide evidence of great similarities between "sweet Italian" and "Reus long pairal" pepper seeds. The present study indicates that C. annuum seeds are a potential source of valuable bioactive compounds that could be used in food industry.
23239555	CHEMICALIN-based inhibitors of GENEIN. GENENOTIN proteins are of importance in cell proliferation, and hence their mutated forms play causative roles in many kinds of cancer in different tissues. Inhibition of the GENENOTIN-depalmitoylating enzyme GENENOTIN is a new approach to modulating the GENENOTIN cycle. Here we present CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN derivatives as a new class of potent and nontoxic GENEIN inhibitors. These compounds were detected by extensive library screening using chemical arrays and turned out to inhibit GENENOTIN in a competitive mode. Furthermore, one of the molecules was demonstrated to inhibit GENENOTIN phosphorylation significantly.
23239592	Three-Dimensional CdS-Titanate Composite Nanomaterials for Enhanced Visible-Light-Driven Hydrogen Evolution. 3D Hierarchical echinus-like titanate spheres (HETSs), serving as the supporting material for CdS nanoparticles, are synthesized via a fast one-step hydrothermal method. The obtained 3D CdS-HETS composite materials show enhanced H2 generation under visible light irradiation.
23246428	UPLC-Q-TOF/HSMS/MS(E)-based metabonomics for adenine-induced changes in metabolic profiles of rat faeces and intervention effects of ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one. Ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (ergone), isolated from the medicinal fungus Polyporus umbellatus, has been proven to prevent the progression of renal injury and the subsequent renal fibrosis. Ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight high-sensitivity mass spectrometry and a novel mass spectrometry(Elevated Energy) (MS(E)) data collection technique was employed to investigate metabonomic characters of chronic renal failure (CRF) induced adenine and the protective effects of ergosta-4,6,8(14),22-tetraen-3-one (ergone). Coupled with blood biochemistry and kidney histopathology results, the significant difference in metabolic profiling between adenine-induced CRF group and ergone-treated CRF group by using pattern recognition analysis indicated that changes in global faecal metabolites were occurred. Seven endogenous metabolites were identified by using metabonomic method combined with multivariate data analysis, the accurate mass, isotopic pattern, MS(E) fragments information and MassLynx i-FIT algorithm. These biochemical changes in faecal metabolites are related to the perturbations of bile acid metabolism and phospholipid metabolism, which may be helpful to further understand the CRF and therapeutic mechanisms of ergone. This research proved that MS(E) can simultaneous acquire precursor ion information and fragment ion data at high and low collision energy in one analytical run, which facilitated the fast structural characterization of metabolites.
23252799	Selective separation of similarly sized proteins with tunable nanoporous block copolymer membranes. An integral asymmetric membrane was fabricated in a fast and one-step process by combining the self-assembly of an amphiphilic block copolymer (PS-b-P4VP) with nonsolvent-induced phase separation. The structure was found to be composed of a thin layer of densely packed highly ordered cylindrical channels with uniform pore sizes perpendicular to the surface on top of a nonordered sponge-like layer. The as-assembled membrane obtained a water flux of more than 3200 L m(-2) h(-1) bar(-1), which was at least an order of magnitude higher than the water fluxes of commercially available membranes with comparable pore sizes, making this membrane particularly well suited to size-selective and charge-based separation of biomolecules. To test the performance of the membrane, we conducted diffusion experiments at the physiological pH of 7.4 using bovine serum albumin (BSA) and globulin-γ, two proteins with different diameters but too close in size (2-fold difference in molecular mass) to be efficiently separated via conventional dialysis membrane processes. The diffusion rate differed by a factor of 87, the highest value reported to date. We also analyzed charge-based diffusive transport and separation of two proteins of similar molecular weight (BSA and bovine hemoglobin (BHb)) through the membrane as a function of external pH. The membrane achieved a selectivity of about 10 at pH 4.7, the isoelectric point (pI) of BSA. We then positively charged the membrane to improve the separation selectivity. With the modified membrane BSA was completely blocked when the pH was 7.0, the pI of BHb, while BHb was completely blocked at pH 4.7. Our results demonstrate the potential of our asymmetric membrane to efficiently separate biological substances/pharmaceuticals in bioscience, biotechnology, and biomedicine applications.
23254196	Phytoestrogen CHEMICALIN protects against endothelial barrier dysfunction in vascular endothelial cells through GENEIN-mediated suppression of GENEIN signaling. The soy-derived phytoestrogen CHEMICALNOTIN has received attention for its potential to improve vascular function, but its mechanism remains unclear. Here, we report that CHEMICALIN at physiologically relevant concentrations (0.1-10 μM) significantly inhibited GENEIN-induced increase in endothelial monolayer permeability. CHEMICALIN also reduced the formation of stress fibers by GENEIN and suppressed GENEIN-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN) on CHEMICALIN(19)/CHEMICALIN(18) in endothelial cells (ECs). CHEMICALIN had no effect on resting intracellular [CHEMICALNOTIN] or GENEIN-induced increase in CHEMICALNOTIN mobilization. Addition of the inhibitors of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN did not alter the protective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. GENENOTIN is a small GENENOTIN that plays an important role in GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN contraction and endothelial barrier dysfunction. GENENOTIN inhibitor blocked the protective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on endothelial permeability and also ablated GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN-phosphorylation in ECs. Inhibition of GENENOTIN significantly attenuated the effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-induced EC permeability, GENEIN phosphorylation, and GENEIN membrane translocation in ECs. Furthermore, GENEIN diminished CHEMICALNOTIN production in ECs, which were prevented by treatment with CHEMICALIN. These findings demonstrated that CHEMICALIN improves GENEIN-induced endothelial barrier dysfunction in ECs through GENEIN-mediated suppression of GENEIN signaling.
23256446	Metabolic effects of honey in type 1 diabetes mellitus: a randomized crossover pilot study. The aim of this study was to evaluate the metabolic effects of 12-week honey consumption on patients suffering from type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM). This was a randomized crossover clinical trial done in the National Institute for Diabetes and Endocrinology, Cairo, Egypt. Twenty patients of both sexes aged 4-18 years with type 1 DM and HbA1C<10% participated in the study. They were randomized into two equal groups (intervention to control and control to intervention). The dietary intervention was 12-week honey consumption in a dose of 0.5 mL/kg body weight per day. The main outcome measures were serum glucose, lipids, and C-peptide, and anthropometric measurements. None of participants were lost in follow-up. The intervention resulted in significant decreases in subscapular skin fold thickness (SSFT; P=.002), fasting serum glucose (FSG; P=.001), total cholesterol (P=.0001), serum triglycerides (TG; P=.0001), and low-density lipoprotein (P=.0009), and significant increases in fasting C-peptide (FCP; P=.0004) and 2-h postprandial C-peptide (PCP; P=.002). As possible long-term effects of honey after its withdrawal, statistically significant reductions in midarm circumference (P=.000), triceps skin fold thickness (P=.006), SSFT (P=.003), FSG (P=.005), 2-h postprandial serum glucose (P=.000), TG (P=.003), and HbA1C (P=.043), and significant increases in FCP (P=.002) and PCP (P=.003) were observed. This small clinical trial suggests that long-term consumption of honey might have positive effects on the metabolic derangements of type 1 DM.
23256625	Evaluation of drug interactions of CHEMICALIN (a GENEIN agonist) with statins: from in vitro data to clinical study design. 1. This work investigated the drug interaction potential of CHEMICALIN, a novel GENEIN agonist, with the GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. 2. In vitro experiments assessed the inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN enzymes by CHEMICALIN, and a clinical drug interaction study investigated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN (300 mg BID) on the pharmacokinetic profile of CHEMICALNOTIN (40 mg single dose) and CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg single dose). 3. In vitro, CHEMICALIN demonstrated little/weak inhibition (IC50 values >30 μM) towards GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN), GENEIN, GENEIN, or GENEIN. However, CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN and GENEIN, which are transporters involved in statin disposition. 4. In the clinical study, small increases in the AUC(0-inf) of CHEMICALNOTIN [mean ratio (90% CI) of 1.34 (1.22, 1.48)] and CHEMICALNOTIN [mean ratio (90% CI) of 1.39 (1.30, 1.49)] were observed when co-administered with CHEMICALIN, which is consistent with an inhibitory effect on intestinal GENEIN and GENEIN. In contrast, CHEMICALIN did not inhibit GENEIN based on the lack of changes in CHEMICALNOTIN acid exposure [mean AUC(0-inf) ratio (90% CI) of 1.05 (0.91, 1.21)]. 5. CHEMICALNOTIN has a weak drug interaction with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. This study provides a mechanistic understanding of the in vivo inhibition of GENEIN and enzymes by CHEMICALIN.
23256719	Antioxidants and mucolytics in COPD management: when (if ever) and in whom? Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Oxidative stress is an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of this disease. The oxidant/ antioxidant imbalance occurring in smokers and patients with COPD is well established. Thus, therapeutic strategies targeting oxidative stress with pharmacological antioxidant agents or boosting the endogenous levels of antioxidants is likely to be beneficial as an adjunctive tool in the treatment of COPD patients. Thiol compounts such as N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), carbocysteine, erdosteine, and fudosteine have been extensively studied. Although some results remain controversial, NAC and carbocysteine seem to have beneficial effect in patients not receiving inhaled corticosteroids who suffer from frequent exacerbations. In addition, other antioxidants like superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimetics and nuclear factor-erythroid 2 related factor 2 (Nrf2) are shown to decrease markers of oxidative stress in patients with emphysema, while others like glutathione peroxidase (GPx) mimetics and NO synthase (iNOS) can prevent both inflammation and oxidative stress in clinical trials in vivo (or in mouse models). In this article we review the effectiveness of various antioxidant factors in COPD and their potential beneficial effect in the treatment of the disease.
23257178	CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity and detoxification in ascomycetous fungi. In the last couple of decades fungal infections have become a significant clinical problem. A major interest into fungal CHEMICALNOTIN action has been provoked since research has proven that CHEMICALNOTIN hormones are toxic to fungi and affect the host/fungus relationship. CHEMICALNOTIN hormones were found to differ in their antifungal activity in ascomycetous fungi Hortaea werneckii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Aspergillus oryzae. Dehydroepiandrosterone was shown to be the strongest inhibitor of growth in all three varieties of fungi followed by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. For their protection, fungi use several mechanisms to lower the toxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN. The efficiency of biotransformation in detoxification depended on the microorganism and CHEMICALNOTIN substrate used. Biotransformation was a relatively slow process as it also depended on the growth phase of the fungus. In addition to biotransformation, CHEMICALNOTIN extrusion out of the cells contributed to the lowering of the active intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentration. Plasma membrane GENENOTIN transporter was found to be the most effective, followed by GENENOTIN transporter and vacuolar transporters GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Proteins GENEIN and GENEIN were not found to be involved in CHEMICALIN import. The research of possible targets of CHEMICALNOTIN hormone action in fungi suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN hormones inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae and H. werneckii. Results of this inhibition caused changes in the CHEMICALNOTIN content of the cellular membrane. The presence of CHEMICALIN hormones most probably causes the degradation of the GENEIN permease and impairment of CHEMICALNOTIN import.
23261051	Cell-cycle and DNA damage regulation of the GENENOTIN occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. DNA mismatch repair during replication is a conserved process essential for maintaining genomic stability. Mismatch repair is also implicated in cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis after DNA damage. Because yeast and human mismatch repair systems are well conserved, we have employed the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to understand the regulation and function of the mismatch repair gene GENENOTIN. Using a luciferase-based transcriptional reporter, we defined a 218-bp region upstream of GENENOTIN that contains GENENOTIN. The 5' end of the GENENOTIN transcript was mapped by primer extension and was found to encode a small GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Mutagenesis of the GENENOTIN or of the GENENOTIN, which creates a continuous reading frame with GENENOTIN, increased GENENOTIN steady-state protein levels ∼2-fold. Furthermore, we found that the cell-cycle transcription factors GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN-along with GENENOTINs upstream of GENENOTIN-are all required for full basal expression of GENENOTIN. Mutagenesis of the GENENOTIN resulted in a minor reduction in basal GENENOTIN levels and a 3-fold defect in mismatch repair. Disruption of the GENENOTIN also affected growth in a GENENOTIN-defective strain background where mismatch repair is essential, particularly in the presence of the DNA damaging agent CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Promoter replacements conferring constitutive expression of GENEIN revealed that the transcriptional induction in response to CHEMICALIN is required to maintain induced levels of GENEIN. Turnover experiments confirmed an elevated rate of degradation in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. Taken together, the data show that the DNA damage regulation of GENENOTIN occurs at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. The transcriptional and translational control elements identified are conserved in mammalian cells, underscoring the use of yeast as a model system to examine the regulation of GENENOTIN.
23261528	Inhibition of Th1/Th17 responses via suppression of GENEIN and GENEIN activation contributes to the amelioration of murine experimental colitis by a natural CHEMICALIN glucoside CHEMICALIN. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder in the intestine which involves overproduction of pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN and excessive functions of inflammatory cells. However, current treatments for IBD may have potential adverse effects including CHEMICALNOTIN dependence, infections and lymphoma. Therefore new therapies or drug candidates for the treatment of IBD are desperately needed. In the present study we found that CHEMICALNOTIN, a major bioactive compound from plants in Epimedium family, exerted protective effect on intestinal inflammation in mice induced by dextran CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN. Oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN significantly attenuated the disease progression and alleviated the pathological changes of colitis. It also inhibited the production of pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN and expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in colon tissues. Further study showed that CHEMICALIN dose-dependently inhibited the proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes, and suppressed pro-inflammatory GENEIN levels of activated T cells. Moreover, CHEMICALIN treatment inhibited the phosphorylations of GENEIN and GENEIN in CD4(+) T cells, which were the crucial transcription factors for Th1 and Th17 respectively. Taken together, these results indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN is a potential therapeutic agent for IBD.
23261705	Stimulatory effect of GENENOTIN on theca-interstitial cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins through GENENOTIN dependent pathway. The present study examined the effect of GENENOTIN-mediated activation of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) signaling network on the proliferation of primary culture of theca-interstitial (T-I) cells. Our results show that insulin treatment increased proliferation of the T-I cells through the GENENOTIN-dependent signaling pathway by increasing cell cycle regulatory proteins. Inhibition of GENENOTIN signaling caused partial reduction of GENENOTIN-induced phosphorylation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN whereas inhibition of GENENOTIN signaling completely blocked the GENENOTIN response. Pharmacological inhibition of GENEIN with CHEMICALIN abrogated the GENEIN-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN, GENEIN and its downstream effector, GENEIN. These results were further confirmed by demonstrating that knockdown of GENENOTIN using siRNA reduced the GENENOTIN-stimulated GENENOTIN signaling. Furthermore, GENEIN-stimulated T-I cell proliferation and the expression of GENEIN GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN were also blocked by CHEMICALIN. Taken together, the present studies show that insulin stimulates cell proliferation and cell cycle regulatory proteins in T-I cells via activation of the GENENOTIN signaling pathway.
23263989	The conserved GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN is a discrete functional module essential for viability in Caenorhabditis elegans. GENENOTIN play an important role in recognizing chromatin modifications and recruiting regulatory proteins to specific genes. A specific module containing a conventional GENENOTIN followed by an extended GENENOTIN exists in the mammalian GENENOTIN protein, among a few others. GENENOTIN has mostly been studied in the context of the leukemic GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN fusion protein, which lacks the CHEMICALIN-terminal PHD fingers of GENEIN. Although this domain of GENENOTIN is the most conserved region of the protein, its biological significance has not been elucidated. In this study, we used genetic and biochemical approaches to examine the GENENOTIN region of the Caenorhabditis elegans ortholog of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). We demonstrate that the GENENOTIN region is essential for viability and that the first GENENOTIN contributes to the preferred binding of GENEIN to CHEMICALIN 4-methylated histone H3 tails. Moreover, we show that GENENOTIN localization peaks overlap with H3K4 methylation-enriched promoters of actively expressed genes genomewide and that H3K4 methylation is important for GENENOTIN localization to promoters in the embryo. We predict that the essential biological role of the GENENOTIN module of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN is connected to the regulation of actively expressed genes during early development.
23265873	Novel limonene and citral based 2,5-disubstituted-1,3,4-oxadiazoles: a natural product coupled approach to semicarbazones for antiepileptic activity. Two novel series of N(4)-(5-(2/3/4-substituted-phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N(1)-(2-methyl-5-(prop-1-en-2-yl)cyclohex-2-enylidene)semicarbazide and N(4)-(5-(2/3/4-substituted-phenyl)-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)-N(1)-(3,7-dimethylocta-3,6-dienylidene)-semicarbazide were synthesized to meet structural prerequisite indispensable for anticonvulsant activity. The anticonvulsant activities of the compounds were investigated using maximal electroshock seizure (MES), subcutaneous pentylenetrtrazole (scPTZ) and subcutaneous strychnine (scSTY) models. The rotorod test was conducted to evaluate neurotoxicity. Some of the selected active compounds were subjected to GABA assay to confirm their mode of action. The outcome of the present investigations proved that the four binding sites pharmacophore model is vital for anticonvulsant activity. The efforts were also made to establish structure-activity relationships among test compounds.
23265901	Synthesis and evaluation of CHEMICALIN derivatives as potent GENEIN agonists with high water solubility. We report the discovery of novel series of highly potent GENEIN agonists based on CHEMICALIN, 1 and 2 by introducing and optimizing various CHEMICALIN onto the CHEMICALIN(9)-position of the CHEMICALIN moiety. The introduction of the CHEMICALIN group resulted in not only improved water solubility but also enhanced GENEIN agonistic activity. In particular compound 20 (CHEMICALNOTIN) indicated an optimal balance between the agonistic potency and high water solubility. It also demonstrated a strong antitumor effect in vivo by intravenous administration in a tumor bearing mice model.
23265904	Discovery of liver-targeted inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Inhibitors based on a CHEMICALIN scaffold were discovered for GENEIN (GENEIN) and subsequently optimized to potent compounds with favorable pharmacokinetic profiles and in vivo efficacy in reducing the desaturation index in a mouse model. Initial optimization revealed potency preferences for the CHEMICALNOTIN core and CHEMICALNOTIN positions, while substituents on the CHEMICALNOTIN portions were more tolerant and allowed for tuning of potency and PK properties. After preparation and testing of a range of functional groups on the CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, three classes of analogs were identified with single digit nanomolar potency: CHEMICALNOTIN, heterocycle-linked CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Responding to concerns about target localization and potential mechanism-based side effects, an initial effort was also made to improve liver concentration in an available rat PK model. An advanced compound 17m with a CHEMICALNOTIN substructure appended to the CHEMICALNOTIN scaffold was developed which satisfied the in vitro and in vivo requirements for more detailed studies.
23266452	N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized mixed micellar nanoparticles for targeted delivery of siRNA to liver. Due to its efficient and specific gene silencing ability, RNA interference has shown great potential in the treatment of liver diseases. However, achieving in vivo delivery of siRNA to critical liver cells remains the biggest obstacle for this technique to be a real clinic therapeutic modality. Here, we describe a promising liver targeting siRNA delivery system based on N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized mixed micellar nanoparticles (Gal-MNP), which can efficiently deliver siRNA to hepatocytes and silence the target gene expression after systemic administration. The Gal-MNP were assembled in aqueous solution from mixed N-acetylgalactosamine functionalized poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone) and cationic poly(ε-caprolactone)-b-poly(2-aminoethyl ethylene phosphate) (PCL-b-PPEEA); the properties of nanoparticles, including particle size, zeta potential and the density of poly(ethylene glycol) could be easily regulated. The hepatocyte-targeting effect of Gal-MNP was demonstrated by significant enriching of fluorescent siRNA in primary hepatocytes in vitro and in vivo. Successful down-regulation of liver-specific apolipoprotein B (apoB) expression was achieved in mouse liver, at both the transcriptional and protein level, following intravenous injection of Gal-MNP/siapoB to BALB/c mice. Systemic delivery of Gal-MNP/siRNA did not induce the innate immune response or positive hepatotoxicity. The results of this study suggested therapeutic potential for the Gal-MNP/siRNA system in liver disease.
23266732	Effects of Yerba Mate tea (Ilex paraguariensis) on vascular endothelial function and liver lipoprotein receptor gene expression in hyperlipidemic rats. Yerba Mate tea (Mate), an infusion made from the leaves of the tree Ilex paraguariensis, is a widely consumed beverage in South America. This study was performed to investigate the effect of Mate tea on vascular endothelial dysfunction and liver lipoprotein receptor gene expression in hyperlipidemic rats, with the aim of gaining insight into its known lipid-lowering protective mechanisms. Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into five groups: a normal control group (NC), a high-fat diet group (HC), and three Mate tea-treated groups. In the NC group, rats were fed with standard diet while in the other groups the rats were fed a high-fat diet for 8weeks. In the Mate tea-treated groups, the rats were fed a high-fat diet supplemented with low, moderate or high concentrations of aqueous Mate tea extract for the final 4weeks. Compared to the HC group, aqueous Mate tea extract significantly reduced endothelin (ET) and thromboxane B(2) (TXB(2)) levels and increased nitric oxide (NO) and 6-keto prostaglandin F(1α) (6-keto-PGF(1α)) levels in the blood, reduced the pathological damage of vascular endothelial cells, decreased intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) protein expression in the thoracic aorta, and upregulated mRNA expression of hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1). These findings indicate that Mate tea administration might have a regulatory effect on blood fat and endothelial function in hyperlipidemia rats. The mechanism may involve protecting vascular endothelial cell function and upregulating the expression of LDLR and SR-B1 genes, thereby inhibiting the occurrence of atherosclerosis.
23267767	Development of GENENOTIN inhibitors: effect of CHEMICALNOTIN substituents on GENENOTIN transcriptional activity under hypoxia. A series of substituted CHEMICALNOTIN were synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit hypoxia-induced GENENOTIN transcriptional activity using a cell-based reporter assay in HeLa cells expressing the GENENOTIN-dependent firefly luciferase reporter construct (GENENOTIN-Luc) and constitutively expressing CMV-driven Renilla luciferase reporter, and their ability to inhibit cell growth (GI(50)) using the CHEMICALNOTIN assay. Among the compounds synthesized, 1g and 1l showed significant inhibition of hypoxia-induced GENENOTIN transcriptional activity (IC(50): 1.9 ± 0.4 and 1.4 ± 0.2 μM, respectively). Both compounds suppressed GENENOTIN accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) refolding assay revealed that compound 1l inhibited GENEIN chaperone activity (IC(50): 6.80 ± 0.25 μM) and this inhibition activity was higher than that of CHEMICALIN (IC(50): 10.9 ± 0.63 μM).
23270704	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN alleviate intermittent hypoxia induced abnormal GENEIN and GENEIN and low CHEMICALNOTIN by suppressing endoplasmic reticulum stress and activated GENEIN in rat testes. We hypothesized that hypoxia induced testicular damage is mediated by an activated GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), therefore, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) an inhibitor of GENEIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (RS), a CHEMICALNOTIN influx inhibitor were tested if they could attenuate hypoxic toxicity to the testis. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to hypoxia (10±0.5% O2) for 17d and intervened with CHEMICALNOTIN and RS in the last 6d. Histological changes and expression of pro-inflammation factors were evaluated in vivo. Biomarkers in isolated Leydig cells incubated with CHEMICALNOTIN were also assayed in vitro. Hypoxic rats displayed lower serum CHEMICALNOTIN and higher GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Upregulation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was associated with downregulation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in the hypoxia testis, revealed by Western blot and immunohistochemical assay, respectively. CHEMICALIN and RS at least partially normalize hypoxia caused male hypogonadism by suppressing ER stress, and GENEIN in testes.
23270805	Coming full circle: contributions of central and peripheral oxytocin actions to energy balance. The neuropeptide oxytocin has emerged as an important anorexigen in the regulation of energy balance. Its effects on food intake have largely been attributed to limiting meal size through interactions in key regulatory brain regions such as the hypothalamus and hindbrain. Pharmacologic and pair-feeding studies indicate that its ability to reduce body mass extends beyond that of food intake, affecting multiple factors that determine energy balance such as energy expenditure, lipolysis, and glucose regulation. Systemic administration of oxytocin recapitulates many of its effects when administered centrally, raising the questions of whether and to what extent circulating oxytocin contributes to energy regulation. Its therapeutic potential to treat metabolic conditions remains to be determined, but data from diet-induced and genetically obese rodent models as well as application of oxytocin in humans in other areas of research have revealed promising results thus far.
23271742	CHEMICALIN suppresses cell survival via GENEIN-mediated proteasomal degradation of GENEIN protein. GENENOTIN, a member of the GENENOTIN family, shares a high degree of sequence similarity with GENENOTIN. Because of transcription from two distinct promoters, the GENENOTIN gene encodes two isoforms, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Although GENENOTIN acts as a tumor suppressor, GENENOTIN functions as an oncogene and is often overexpressed in squamous cell carcinomas. Thus, therapeutic agents targeting GENENOTIN might be used to manage tumors that overexpress GENENOTIN. Here we found that CHEMICALIN, a frontline agent for acute promyelocytic leukemia, inhibits GENEIN but not GENEIN expression in time- and dose-dependent manners. In addition, we found that CHEMICALIN decreases the stability of GENEIN protein via a GENEIN-dependent pathway but has little effect on the level of GENEIN transcript. Furthermore, we found that CHEMICALIN activates the GENEIN and consequently induces GENEIN expression. Consistent with this, we found that knockdown of GENENOTIN inhibits, whereas ectopic expression of GENENOTIN enhances, CHEMICALIN-induced degradation of GENEIN protein. Importantly, we found that knockdown of GENENOTIN sensitizes, whereas ectopic expression of GENENOTIN inhibits, growth suppression induced by CHEMICALNOTIN. Together, these data suggest that CHEMICALIN degrades GENEIN protein at least in part via GENEIN-dependent proteolysis and that inhibition of GENEIN expression facilitates tumor cells to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced death.
23274058	CHEMICALIN, isolated from dietary mugwort (Artemisia princeps), induces G2/M cell cycle arrest by inactivating GENEIN-GENEIN via GENEIN-GENENOTIN activation. CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN derived from Artemisia princeps (Japanese mugwort), has been shown to inhibit the growth of several human cancer cells, However, the exact mechanism for the cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN is not completely understood. In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism involved in the antiproliferative effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in human endometrial cancer cells. We demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN is a more potent inhibitor of cell growth than CHEMICALNOTIN in human endometrial cancer cells. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cytotoxicity in normal endometrial cells was lower than that observed for CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN induced G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and modulated the levels of GENEIN and GENEIN in Hec1A cells. Knockdown of GENENOTIN using specific siRNAs partially abrogated CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cell growth inhibition. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN-GENENOTIN. Ku55933, an GENENOTIN inhibitor, reversed CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cell growth inhibition, in part. Moreover, CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in phosphorylation of GENEIN, and pretreatment with the GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, attenuated cell growth inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN. These data suggest that CHEMICALIN, isolated from Japanese mugwort, modulates the GENEIN/GENEIN/GENENOTIN pathway, leading to inactivation of the GENEIN-GENEIN complex, followed by G2/M cell cycle arrest in endometrial cancer cells.
23274893	EphA5-EphrinA5 interactions within the ventromedial hypothalamus influence counterregulatory hormone release and local glutamine/glutamate balance during hypoglycemia. Activation of β-cell EphA5 receptors by its ligand ephrinA5 from adjacent β-cells has been reported to decrease insulin secretion during hypoglycemia. Given the similarities between islet and ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) glucose sensing, we tested the hypothesis that the EphA5/ephrinA5 system might function within the VMH during hypoglycemia to stimulate counterregulatory hormone release as well. Counterregulatory responses and glutamine/glutamate concentrations in the VMH were assessed during a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic glucose clamp study in chronically catheterized awake male Sprague-Dawley rats that received an acute VMH microinjection of ephrinA5-Fc, chronic VMH knockdown, or overexpression of ephrinA5 using an adenoassociated viral construct. Local stimulation of VMH EphA5 receptors by ephrinA5-Fc or ephrinA5 overexpression increased, whereas knockdown of VMH ephrinA5 reduced counterregulatory responses during hypoglycemia. Overexpression of VMH ephrinA5 transiently increased local glutamate concentrations, whereas ephrinA5 knockdown produced profound suppression of VMH interstitial fluid glutamine concentrations in the basal state and during hypoglycemia. Changes in ephrinA5/EphA5 interactions within the VMH, a key brain glucose-sensing region, act in concert with islets to restore glucose homeostasis during acute hypoglycemia, and its effect on counterregulation may be mediated by changes in glutamate/glutamine cycling.
23274898	Electrical Stimuli Release CHEMICALIN to Increase GENEIN Translocation and CHEMICALIN Uptake via GENEIN-GENEIN-GENEIN in Skeletal Muscle Cells. Skeletal muscle CHEMICALNOTIN uptake in response to exercise is preserved in GENENOTIN-resistant conditions, but the signals involved are debated. CHEMICALIN is released from skeletal muscle by contractile activity and can autocrinely signal through GENEIN, and we hypothesized it may influence CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. Electrical stimulation, CHEMICALNOTIN, and GENENOTIN each increased fluorescent CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) uptake in primary myotubes, but only electrical stimulation and CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN uptake were inhibited by GENEIN and by GENEIN blockade (CHEMICALIN). Electrical stimulation transiently elevated extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN and caused GENEIN phosphorylation that was additive to GENENOTIN and inhibited by CHEMICALIN. Exogenous CHEMICALIN transiently activated GENEIN and, inhibiting GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) or GENENOTIN as well as dominant-negative GENENOTIN mutant, reduced CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and GENENOTIN phosphorylation. CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN uptake was also inhibited by the GENENOTIN subunit-interacting peptide βark-ct and by the GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN caused translocation of GENEINmyc-eGFP to the cell surface, mechanistically mediated by increased exocytosis involving GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN reduced by dominant-negative GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN GENENOTIN-dead mutants, and potentiated by GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN uptake in normal and GENENOTIN-resistant adult muscle fibers, resembling the reported effect of exercise. Hence, the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced pathway may be tapped to bypass GENENOTIN resistance.
23275442	The GENENOTIN interacts with and regulates GENENOTIN stability. The transcription factor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) exerts crucial functions in the regulation of host immunity against extracellular pathogens, DNA damage-induced apoptosis, GENENOTIN signaling, and macrophage polarization. Tight regulation of GENENOTIN is thus warranted for an efficient response toward extracellular stressors and for limiting autoimmune and inflammatory responses. Here we report that the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a general modulator of diverse cellular and developmental processes, associates constitutively with GENENOTIN and promotes its protein stability. The constitutive GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interaction was identified using proteomics and confirmed by endogenous immunoprecipitations. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interaction occurred on the CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN termini of GENEIN; a single internal deletion from CHEMICALIN 455 to 466 (Δ455-466) was found to significantly reduce GENEIN protein stability. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was identified as a direct interacting partner of GENENOTIN, and knockdown of this subunit with small interfering RNAs resulted in enhanced degradation. Degradation was further augmented by knockdown of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN together. The GENENOTIN inhibitor UBEI-41 or the GENENOTIN inhibitor MG132 prevented GENENOTIN degradation, supporting the idea that its stability is regulated by the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN system. Importantly, activation of GENENOTIN by the GENENOTIN ligand GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) resulted in enhanced degradation via loss of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interaction. This study defines GENENOTIN to be a new interacting partner of GENENOTIN that controls its stability.
23279865	Structure-based design, synthesis and evaluation of novel CHEMICALIN derivatives as GENEIN inhibitors and potential for cancer polypharmacology. A series of CHEMICALIN derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for GENEIN inhibition, GENEIN expression and suppression of cancer cell growth in vitro. All of the compounds tested, except for compounds 4, 7, 16, 24, 27 and 28 were selected by the NCI screening system. Among them, compounds 16, 39, and 40 repressed GENENOTIN expression without greatly affecting cell growth, suggesting for the selectivity toward GENENOTIN expression. Taken together, our findings indicated that the analysis of cytotoxicity and GENENOTIN inhibition might provide information applicable for further developing potential GENENOTIN and polypharmacological targeting strategy.
23282999	Zinc sulphate and vitamin E alleviate reproductive toxicity caused by aluminium sulphate in male albino rats. This study was designed to investigate the reproductive toxicity of aluminium sulphate and the therapeutic effects of administration of zinc sulphate and vitamin E individually or in combination against the toxic effect caused by aluminium (Al) in male albino rats. The animals were divided into five groups: group 1 received distilled water and served as control; group 2 received only aluminium sulphate (50 mg/kg body weight (b.w.)); group 3 received aluminium sulphate (50 mg/kg b.w.) plus zinc sulphate (50 mg/kg b.w.); group 4 received aluminium sulphate (50 mg/kg b.w.) and vitamin E (15 mg/kg b.w.); group 5 received aluminium sulphate plus a combination of zinc sulphate and vitamin E in similar doses as above. Doses were administered orally once daily for 45 consecutive days. The results revealed that aluminium sulphate induced significant decrease in body weight gain and testis weight and significant increase in Al level in both serum and testes of male rats. Biochemical analysis showed significant decrease in serum total protein and phospholipids levels, while serum total lipid was significantly elevated post Al treatment. In addition, significant decrease in total protein, phospholipids and cholesterol levels in the testes of Al-treated rats was recorded. The data also showed significant decrease in the levels of serum testosterone, leutinizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone and significant increase in the level of serum prolactin in Al-intoxicated rats. Moreover, histological examination showed that aluminium sulphate caused apparent alterations in the testicular structure of the treated animals. Treatment with zinc sulphate and vitamin E individually or in combination ameliorated the harmful effects of Al, which was proved histopathologically by the noticeable improvement in the testicular tissues. We can conclude that the tested dose of aluminium sulphate induced toxic effect on the reproductive system of male albino rats and the treatment with zinc sulphate and/or vitamin E alleviated these toxic effects. In some cases, vitamin E exerted a more potent effect, while in other cases, the more potent effect is related to zinc sulphate and the combination of both at most of the recorded data.
23284002	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN-induced reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species accumulation and myofibroblast differentiation via enhanced GENEIN-GENEIN signaling. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been shown to prevent fibrosis in vitro and in vivo. The present study aimed at investigating the role of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) scavenging by CHEMICALIN on GENEIN (GENENOTIN-induced myofibroblast differentiation of corneal fibroblasts in vitro. Human immortalized corneal fibroblasts were treated with GENENOTIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), the antioxidant CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), the GENEIN-GENEIN (GENEIN-GENEIN) activator CHEMICALIN, or small interfering RNA. Myofibroblast differentiation was assessed by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression, GENENOTIN bundle formation, and GENENOTIN gel contraction. ROS, CHEMICALNOTIN, intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) level, cellular total antioxidant capacity, and the activation of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN signaling were determined with various assays. Treatment with CHEMICALIN and the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN activator resulted in increased inhibition of the GENEIN-induced myofibroblast differentiation as compared with treatment with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN also decreased cellular ROS and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation induced by GENEIN, whereas it elevated intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN level and cellular total antioxidant capacity. In addition, CHEMICALIN induced GENEIN nuclear translocation and up-regulated the expression of GENEIN-GENEIN downstream antioxidant genes, whereas GENENOTIN knockdown by RNA interference blocked the inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN on myofibroblast differentiation. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence implicating that CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN-induced ROS accumulation and myofibroblast differentiation via enhanced GENEIN-GENEIN signaling.
23287700	CHEMICALNOTIN discrimination and antagonism by GENENOTIN neutral and inverse agonist antagonists. GENEIN (GENEIN) inverse agonists (e.g., CHEMICALIN) have been reported to produce adverse effects including nausea, emesis, and anhedonia that limit their clinical applications. Recent laboratory studies suggest that the effects of GENENOTIN neutral antagonists differ from those of such inverse agonists, raising the possibility of improved clinical utility. However, little is known regarding the antagonist properties of neutral antagonists. In the present studies, the GENEIN inverse agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and the GENEIN neutral antagonist CHEMICALIN were compared for their ability to modify GENEIN-mediated discriminative stimulus effects in nonhuman primates trained to discriminate the novel GENEIN full agonist CHEMICALIN. Results indicate that CHEMICALIN serves as an effective GENEIN discriminative stimulus, with an onset and time course of action comparable with that of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN, and that the inverse agonist CHEMICALIN and the neutral antagonist CHEMICALIN produce dose-related rightward shifts in the CHEMICALIN dose-effect curve, indicating that both drugs surmountably antagonize the discriminative stimulus effects of CHEMICALIN. Schild analyses further show that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN produce highly similar antagonist effects, as evident in comparable pA(2) values (6.9). Taken together with previous studies, the present data suggest that the improved safety profile suggested for GENENOTIN neutral antagonists over inverse agonists is not accompanied by a loss of antagonist action at GENENOTIN.
23292170	Marked decline in beta cell function during pregnancy leads to the development of CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance in Japanese women. The aim of this study is to investigate CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism longitudinally during pregnancy to explore mechanisms underlying gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). We reviewed a total of 62 pregnant Japanese women who underwent a 75g oral CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance test (OGTT) twice during pregnancy (median: early, 13; late, 28 weeks' gestation) because of positive GDM screening. All showed normal OGTT results in early pregnancy. Based on late OGTT, 15 had GDM (late-onset GDM) and 47 normal CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance (NGT). In early pregnancy, there were no significant differences in GENEIN sensitivity (GENENOTIN sensitivity index derived from OGTT [ISOGTT] and homeostasis model assessment for GENENOTIN resistance [HOMA-IR]) and GENENOTIN secretion (a ratio of the total area-under-the-GENENOTIN-curve to the total area-under-the-CHEMICALIN-curve [AUCins/glu] and insulinogenic index [IGI]) between the NGT and late-onset GDM groups. In each group, GENENOTIN sensitivity significantly decreased from early to late pregnancy, most in the late-onset GDM group (each p < 0.05). The GENENOTIN secretion showed no significant changes with advancing pregnancy in both of the groups, although late-onset GDM showed significantly lower IGI compared with NGT in late OGTT (p < 0.05). When assessed beta cell function by OGTT-derived disposition index (i.e. GENENOTIN Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 and IGI/fasting GENENOTIN), the indices significantly decreased from early to late pregnancy in the both groups (each p < 0.05). Women with late-onset GDM showed significantly lower indices compared with NGT (each p < 0.05). The failure of beta cell to compensate for decreased GENENOTIN sensitivity could contribute to the development of the late-onset GDM.
23292752	New oral anticoagulants: comparative pharmacology with CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists. New oral anticoagulants (OACs) that directly inhibit GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) or GENENOTIN have been developed for the long-term prevention of thromboembolic disorders. These novel agents provide numerous benefits over older CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists (VKAs) due to major pharmacological differences. VKAs are economical and very well characterized, but have important limitations that can outweigh these advantages, such as slow onset of action, narrow therapeutic window and unpredictable anticoagulant effect. VKA-associated dietary precautions, monitoring and dosing adjustments to maintain international normalized ratio (INR) within therapeutic range, and bridging therapy, are inconvenient for patients, expensive, and may result in inappropriate use of VKA therapy. This may lead to increased bleeding risk or reduced anticoagulation and increased risk of thrombotic events. The new OACs have rapid onset of action, low potential for food and drug interactions, and predictable anticoagulant effect that removes the need for routine monitoring. GENEIN inhibitors, e.g. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, are potent, oral direct inhibitors of GENEIN-bound, clot-associated or free GENEIN. Both agents have a rapid onset of action, a wide therapeutic window, little or no interaction with food and other drugs, minimal inter-patient variability, and display similar pharmacokinetics in different patient populations. Since both are substrates, co-administration of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN with strong GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors and inducers can result in substantial changes in plasma concentrations due to altered clearance rates; consequently, their concomitant use is contraindicated and caution is required when used concomitantly with strong GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN inducers. Although parenteral oral direct GENEIN inhibitors (DTIs), such as CHEMICALIN and bivalirudin, have been on the market for years, DTIs such as CHEMICALIN are novel synthetic GENEIN antagonists. CHEMICALNOTIN is a low-molecular-weight non-active pro-drug that is administered orally and converted rapidly to its active form, CHEMICALNOTIN--a potent, competitive and reversible DTI. CHEMICALIN has an advantage over the indirect GENEIN inhibitors, unfractionated heparin and low-molecular-weight heparin, in that it inhibits free and GENEIN-bound GENEIN. The reversible binding of CHEMICALIN may provide safer and more predictable anticoagulant treatment than seen with irreversible, non-covalent GENEIN inhibitors, e.g. hirudin. CHEMICALNOTIN shows a very low potential for drug-drug interactions. However, co-administration of CHEMICALNOTIN with other anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents can increase the bleeding risk. Although the new agents are pharmacologically better than VKAs--particularly in terms of fixed dosing, rapid onset of action, no INR monitoring and lower risk of drug interactions--there are some differences between them: the bioavailability of CHEMICALNOTIN is lower than CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and so the CHEMICALNOTIN dosage required is higher; lower protein binding of CHEMICALNOTIN reduces the variability related to albuminaemia. The risk of metabolic drug-drug interactions also appears to differ between OACs: VKAs > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN. The convenience of the new OACs has translated into improvements in efficacy and safety as shown in phase III randomized trials. The new anticoagulants so far offer the greatest promise and opportunity for the replacement of VKAs.
23293126	Effects of smoking on the oxidant/antioxidant balance and the blood lipids in pesticide sprayers. The present study was conducted on 80 pesticide male sprayers (42 nonsmokers and 38 smokers). Our aim was to estimate the smoking effects on blood lipids and oxidant/antioxidant status in pesticide sprayers. Results revealed that cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and glutathion peroxidase (GPx) enzyme were significantly higher in the 38 smoker sprayers than in the 42 nonsmoker sprayers. Cholesterol and LDL were correlated with smoking index and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme and zinc (Zn) were inversely correlated with duration of pesticides' exposure. In nonsmokers, LDL and cholesterol were negatively correlated with SOD and correlated with malondialdehyde (MDA), and cholesterol was negatively correlated with Zn. HDL was negatively correlated with MDA in all the sprayers, but was correlated with GPx in smokers and with Zn in nonsmokers. In smokers, LDL was negatively correlated with GPx, HDL was negatively correlated with MDA and triglycerides and very-low-density lipoprotein were negatively correlated with Zn. MDA was negatively correlated with SOD, GPx and Zn. Smoking and pesticide exposure could be responsible for hyperlipidemia and oxidative stress. Therefore, improvement in the antioxidant status is mandatory for pesticide sprayers especially the ones who smoke.
23295229	Fluorescence lifetime analysis and effect of CHEMICALNOTIN ions on binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyzes the oxidation of toxic CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN. Physiologic levels of CHEMICALIN ions decrease GENEIN activity in part by increasing CHEMICALIN binding affinity to the enzyme. By using time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy, we have resolved the fluorescent lifetimes (τ) of free CHEMICALNOTIN in solution (τ=0.4 ns) and two enzyme-bound CHEMICALNOTIN states (τ=2.0 ns and τ=7.7 ns). We used this technique to investigate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN ions on the GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN binding characteristics and enzyme catalysis. From the resolved free and bound CHEMICALNOTIN fluorescence signatures, the KD values for both CHEMICALIN conformations in GENEIN ranged from about 24 μM to 1 μM for CHEMICALIN ion concentrations of 0-6000 μM, respectively. The rate constants for dissociation of the enzyme-CHEMICALNOTIN complex ranged from 0.03 s(-1) (6000 μM CHEMICALNOTIN) to 0.30s(-1) (0 μM CHEMICALNOTIN) as determined by addition of excess CHEMICALNOTIN to prevent re-association of CHEMICALNOTIN and resolving the real-time CHEMICALNOTIN fluorescence signal. During the initial reaction of enzyme with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, there was an immediate rise in the CHEMICALNOTIN fluorescence, due to the formation of bound CHEMICALNOTIN complexes, with a constant steady-state rate of production of free CHEMICALNOTIN. As the CHEMICALIN ion concentration was increased, there was a consistent decrease of the enzyme catalytic turnover from 0.31 s(-1) (0 μM CHEMICALNOTIN) to 0.050 s(-1) (6000 μM CHEMICALNOTIN) and a distinct shift in steady-state conformational population from one that favors the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN complex with the shorter fluorescence lifetime (33% excess) in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN ion to one that favors the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN complex with the longer fluorescence lifetime (13% excess) at 6000 μM CHEMICALNOTIN. This shift in conformational population at higher CHEMICALIN ion concentrations and to lower enzyme activity may be due to longer residence time of the CHEMICALIN in the GENEIN pocket. The results from monitoring enzyme catalysis in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN suggests that the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN complex with the shorter fluorescence lifetime is the form initially produced, and the complex with the longer fluorescence lifetime is produced through isomerization.
23296102	CHEMICALNOTIN induces Alzheimer's disease-like pathologies in vitro and in vivo. The pathologic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have not been fully uncovered. CHEMICALNOTIN, a ubiquitous dietary pollutant and by-product of oxidative stress, can induce cytotoxicity in neurons, which might play an important role in the etiology of AD. Here, we examined the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the AD pathologies in vitro and in vivo. We found CHEMICALNOTIN induced HT22 cells death in concentration- and time-dependent manners. Interestingly, CHEMICALIN increased proteins' levels of GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN) and the GENEIN GENEIN, and decreased GENEIN levels. In vivo, chronic oral exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (2.5 mg/kg/day by intragastric gavage for 8 weeks) induced mild cognitive declination and pyknosis/atrophy of hippocampal neurons. The activity of GENENOTIN was down-regulated while the level of CHEMICALNOTIN was up-regulated in rat brain. Moreover, CHEMICALIN resulted in activation of astrocytes, up-regulation of GENEIN in cortex and down-regulation of GENEIN in hippocampus and cortex. Taken together, our findings suggest that exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN induces AD-like pathology in vitro and in vivo. Scavenging CHEMICALNOTIN might be beneficial for the therapy of AD.
23296142	Membrane-initiated CHEMICALNOTIN signaling in immortalized hypothalamic N-38 neurons. Regulation of sexual reproduction by CHEMICALIN involves the activation of GENEIN (GENEIN) in the hypothalamus. Of the two classical GENENOTIN involved in reproduction, GENENOTIN appears to be the critical isoform. The role of GENENOTIN in reproduction has been found to involve a nuclear GENENOTIN that induces a genomic mechanism of action. More recently, a plasma membrane GENENOTIN has been shown to trigger signaling pathways involved in reproduction. Mechanisms underlying membrane-initiated estradiol signaling are emerging, including evidence that activation of plasma membrane GENENOTIN involves receptor trafficking. The present study examined the insertion of GENENOTIN into the plasma membrane of N-38 neurons, an immortalized murine hypothalamic cell line. We identified, using western blotting and PCR that N-38 neurons express full-length 66kDa GENENOTIN and a 52kDa GENENOTIN spliced variant missing the fourth exon - GENENOTIN. Using surface biotinylation, we observed that treatment of N-38 neurons with CHEMICALIN or with a membrane impermeant CHEMICALIN elevated plasma membrane GENEIN protein levels, indicating that membrane signaling increased receptor insertion into the cell membrane. Insertion of GENEIN was blocked by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN or with the GENEIN (GENEIN) pathway inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Downstream membrane-initiated signaling was confirmed by CHEMICALNOTIN activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and the release of intracellular calcium. These results indicate that membrane GENEIN levels in N-38 neurons are dynamically autoregulated by CHEMICALIN.
23296837	Neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties of a coffee component in the CHEMICALNOTIN model of Parkinson's disease. Consumption of coffee is associated with reduced risk of Parkinson's disease (PD), an effect that has largely been attributed to caffeine. However, coffee contains numerous components that may also be neuroprotective. One of these compounds is CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which ameliorates the phenotype of GENEIN transgenic mice associated with decreased protein aggregation and phosphorylation, improved neuronal integrity and reduced neuroinflammation. Here, we sought to investigate if CHEMICALNOTIN has an effect in the CHEMICALNOTIN model of PD. Mice fed a diet containing CHEMICALNOTIN for four weeks exhibited dose-dependent preservation of nigral dopaminergic neurons following CHEMICALNOTIN challenge compared to animals given control feed. Reductions in striatal CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN content were also less pronounced with CHEMICALIN treatment. The neuroinflammatory response to CHEMICALNOTIN was markedly attenuated, and indices of oxidative stress and GENEIN activation were significantly prevented with CHEMICALIN. In cultured primary microglia and astrocytes, CHEMICALIN had a direct anti-inflammatory effect demonstrated by repression of lipopolysaccharide-induced GENEIN activation, GENEIN induction, and CHEMICALNOTIN production. CHEMICALNOTIN also exhibited a robust anti-oxidant activity in vitro. Additionally, in SH-SY5Y cells, CHEMICALIN-induced demethylation of GENEIN (GENEIN), the master regulator of the cellular phosphoregulatory network, and cytotoxicity were ameliorated by CHEMICALIN. These findings indicate that the neuroprotective effect of CHEMICALIN against CHEMICALIN is through several mechanisms including its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities as well as its ability to modulate the methylation and hence activity of GENEIN. Our data, therefore, reveal a strong beneficial effect of a novel component of coffee in multiple endpoints relevant to PD.
23297346	CHEMICALNOTIN, the next potent preventive and therapeutic agent in aging and age-associated diseases. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is the third endogenous signaling gasotransmitter, following CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. It is physiologically generated by GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN has been gaining increasing attention as an important endogenous signaling molecule because of its significant effects on the cardiovascular and nervous systems. Substantial evidence shows that CHEMICALIN is involved in aging by inhibiting free-radical reactions, activating GENEIN, and probably interacting with the age-related gene GENEIN. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to have therapeutic potential in age-associated diseases. This article provides an overview of the physiological functions and effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in aging and age-associated diseases, and proposes the potential health and therapeutic benefits of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23298677	Induction of GENEIN through GENEIN GENEIN/GENENOTIN signaling pathway by CHEMICALIN extract of Inula helenium L. reduces inflammation in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells and CLP-induced septic mice. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) plays a crucial mediator in the pathogenesis of many inflammatory diseases. We recently proposed that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) negatively regulates GENENOTIN in inflammatory conditions. We investigated whether CHEMICALNOTIN extract of Inula helenium L. (EIH) activates GENENOTIN GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathways in RAW264.7 cells and reduces inflammation in CLP-induced septic mice. EIH induced expression of GENENOTIN protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. EIH significantly diminished GENENOTIN expression in GENENOTIN RNA-transfected cells. As expected, the inhibited expression of GENENOTIN/NO, GENENOTIN/PGE2, GENENOTIN release by EIH in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells was significantly reversed by GENENOTINRNA transfection. Furthermore, EIH not only inhibited GENENOTIN luciferase activity, phosphorylation of GENENOTIN in LPS-activated cells but also significantly suppressed expression of adhesion molecules (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) in GENENOTIN activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells. The induction of GENEIN by EIH was inhibited by CHEMICALIN but not by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, nor CHEMICALIN. Most importantly, administration of EIH significantly reduced not only increase in blood GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, BUN, CHEMICALNOTIN levels but also decrease macrophage infiltrate in the liver of septic mice, which were reversed by ZnPPIX, a GENENOTIN inhibitor. We concluded that EIH has anti-inflammatory effect via the induction of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN signaling pathway.
23307185	Protease-activated receptor (PAR) 1 and PAR4 differentially regulate factor V expression from human platelets. With the recent interest of protease-activated receptors (PAR) 1 and PAR4 as possible targets for the treatment of thrombotic disorders, we compared the efficacy of protease-activated receptor (PAR)1 and PAR4 in the generation of procoagulant phenotypes on platelet membranes. PAR4-activating peptide (AP)-stimulated platelets promoted thrombin generation in plasma up to 5 minutes earlier than PAR1-AP-stimulated platelets. PAR4-AP-mediated factor V (FV) association with the platelet surface was 1.6-fold greater than for PAR1-AP. Moreover, PAR4 stimulation resulted in a 3-fold greater release of microparticles, compared with PAR1 stimulation. More robust FV secretion and microparticle generation with PAR4-AP was attributable to stronger and more sustained phosphorylation of myosin light chain at serine 19 and threonine 18. Inhibition of Rho-kinase reduced PAR4-AP-mediated FV secretion and microparticle generation to PAR1-AP-mediated levels. Thrombin generation assays measuring prothrombinase complex activity demonstrated 1.5-fold higher peak thrombin levels on PAR4-AP-stimulated platelets, compared with PAR1-AP-stimulated platelets. Rho-kinase inhibition reduced PAR4-AP-mediated peak thrombin generation by 25% but had no significant effect on PAR1-AP-mediated thrombin generation. In conclusion, stimulation of PAR4 on platelets leads to faster and more robust thrombin generation, compared with PAR1 stimulation. The greater procoagulant potential is related to more efficient FV release from intracellular stores and microparticle production driven by stronger and more sustained myosin light chain phosphorylation. These data have implications about the role of PAR4 during hemostasis and are clinically relevant in light of recent efforts to develop PAR antagonists to treat thrombotic disorders.
23311608	Diels-Alder mediated controlled release from a poly(ethylene glycol) based hydrogel. A synthetic amino acid bearing a furan functionality was developed and incorporated into peptide sequences using solid phase synthesis. Peptides expressing the furan moiety were attached to poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels through a thermally reversible covalent bond formed by a Diels-Alder reaction. Reactions of thiol and maleimide PEG macromers in an off-stoichiometric Michael addition were performed, such that the maleimide moiety was in excess, to create hydrogel networks with pendant Diels-Alder compatible tethering sites, that is, the maleimide. By making use of the Diels-Alder reaction, it was possible to control the release rate of reversibly bound moieties from the hydrogel by changing the temperature; higher temperatures favor a faster retro-Diels-Alder reaction and, therefore, a faster release from the polymer network. This concept was demonstrated by incorporating a fluorescently labeled furan-RGDS sequence into a hydrogel possessing excess maleimide functionalities and monitoring the subsequent liberation of RGDS at various temperatures, illustrating a Diels-Alder mediated release mechanism. The release profile was quantified at temperatures ranging from physiological (37 °C) to 80 °C. By changing the temperature, varying extents of release were attained over the time course of several days, ranging from 40% release for lower temperatures to complete release for the highest temperature considered. Further confirmation of a reaction-diffusion controlled release mechanism was obtained through comparison of experimental release data to a reaction-diffusion model of the release. In addition to thermal modulation, tuning of the release rate was accomplished by altering the number of possible Diels-Alder tethering sites present in the hydrogel. Increasing the amount of free maleimide and, therefore, the number of potential Diels-Alder reaction sites, effectively slowed the release of peptide from the polymer. For instance, doubling the amount of maleimide sites present in the hydrogel system decreased the amount of peptide released from approximately 60% to about 40% in the same span of time.
23312283	CHEMICALNOTIN, a metabolite associated with atherosclerosis, exhibits complex genetic and dietary regulation. Circulating CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels are strongly associated with atherosclerosis. We now examine genetic, dietary, and hormonal factors regulating CHEMICALNOTIN levels. We demonstrate that two GENEIN family members, GENEIN and GENEIN, oxidize CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), derived from gut flora metabolism of CHEMICALIN, to CHEMICALIN. Further, we show that GENENOTIN exhibits 10-fold higher specific activity than GENENOTIN. GENEIN overexpression in mice significantly increases plasma CHEMICALIN levels while silencing GENEIN decreases CHEMICALIN levels. In both humans and mice, hepatic GENENOTIN expression is reduced in males compared to females. In mice, this reduction in GENEIN expression is due primarily to downregulation by CHEMICALIN. GENEIN expression is induced by dietary CHEMICALIN by a mechanism that involves the GENEIN (GENEIN), a CHEMICALIN-activated nuclear receptor. Analysis of natural genetic variation among inbred strains of mice indicates that GENEIN and CHEMICALIN are significantly correlated, and CHEMICALNOTIN levels explain 11% of the variation in atherosclerosis.
23313270	Tricycloalternarenes F-H: three new mixed terpenoids produced by an endolichenic fungus Ulocladium sp. using OSMAC method. Three new mixed terpenoids, tricycloalternarenes (TCAs) F-H (1-3), together with ten known tricycloalternarenes (4-13), were isolated from the Czapek's culture of an endophytic fungus Ulocladium sp. Their structures were identified by extensive spectroscopic experiments (NMR and MS) and comparison with literature data. TCA 1b (5) showed weak activity against the Bacille Calmette-Guerin strain with the MIC of 125μg/mL. TCA 9b (10) exhibited strong cytotoxic activity against Hela cell line with IC50 of 8.58μM.
23313336	What are the physiological CHEMICALNOTIN? CHEMICALNOTIN (E2) is the principal physiological estrogen in mammals. E2 and its active metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN have a characteristic phenolic A ring, unlike CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, which have an A ring containing a C3-CHEMICALNOTIN, a Δ(4) bond and a C19 CHEMICALNOTIN group. Crystal structures of E2 in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) confirm the importance of the A ring in stabilizing E2 in the GENENOTIN. However, other CHEMICALIN, including CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, which have a saturated A ring containing a CHEMICALIN and a C19 CHEMICALIN group, also mediate physiological responses through binding to GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN. Moreover, selective CHEMICALIN response modulators (SERMs) with diverse structures also regulate transcription of GENEIN and GENEIN. Our understanding of the physiological responses mediated by these "alternative" CHEMICALNOTIN is in its infancy. Further studies of the role of these CHEMICALIN and SERMs in regulating responses mediated by GENEIN and GENEIN a variety of tissues, during different stages of development, are likely to uncover additional estrogenic activities.
23313637	Synthesis of CHEMICALIN derivatives: discovery of a potent and selective GENEIN inhibitor for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. GENEIN (GENEIN) mediates the degradation of CHEMICALIN in a variety of tissues including brain. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathway to the process of learning and memory. Thus, GENENOTIN inhibitors (PDE5Is) are thought to be promising new therapeutic agents for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by memory loss. To explore this possibility, a series of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives were synthesized and evaluated. We found that compound 7a selectively inhibits GENENOTIN with an IC(50) of 0.27 nM and readily crosses the blood brain barrier. In an in vivo mouse model of AD, compound 7a rescues synaptic and memory defects. CHEMICALNOTIN-based, CNS-permeant PDE5Is have potential for AD therapeutic development.
23314054	Fragment-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of CHEMICALIN derivatives as novel GENEIN inhibitors. We have previously reported a nanomolar inhibitor of antiapoptotic GENEIN protein, CHEMICALIN (S1). S1 plays its function by binding to the BH3 groove of GENENOTIN. Basing on this spacial structural characteristic, we developed a novel class of GENENOTIN inhibitor using fragment-based drug discovery approach. By dissecting S1, we identified the compound 4 with a CHEMICALNOTIN core as the starting fragment. In the following molecular growth, we used the ligand efficiency evaluation and fit quality score to assess the fragments. A novel potent compound, CHEMICALIN (12c), which binds GENEIN with an IC(50) value of 54 nM was obtained. Compound 12c demonstrated a better aqueous solubility than S1.
23315216	Transaldolase deficiency: report of 12 new cases and further delineation of the phenotype. PURPOSE: Transaldolase deficiency is a recently described inborn error of pentose phosphate pathway. We conducted this study to further delineate the associated phenotype. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report on 12 new cases representing six families with this metabolic defect that were observed over an 8 year span. None of these cases received the correct diagnosis initially because of significant overlap in the presenting symptoms (growth retardation, dysmorphic features, cutis laxa, congenital heart disease, hepatosplenomegaly, pancytopenia, and bleeding tendency) with a wide range of genetic disorders. However, the consanguineous nature of these families allowed us to pursue autozygome analysis, which highlighted TALDO as the likely candidate gene and sequencing confirmed segregation of a novel homozygous mutation with the disease in all the studied families. Biochemical analysis was also consistent with transaldolase deficiency. CONCLUSION: This study expands the clinical definition of transaldolase deficiency, and adds to its allelic heterogeneity. In addition, we emphasize the diagnostic challenge posed by this rare and pleiotropic metabolic disorder.
23317163	Cellular signaling crosstalk between multiple receptors for investigation of pathophysiology in multifactorial diseases--what is clinically-relevant crosstalk? Recently, genomics and proteomics have been utilized as advanced tools for investigation of cellular signaling pathways and molecular interactions, and elucidated promiscuous networks composed of numerous interactions among pathways. However, some of these interactions are considered to be simply contributing to background 'noise' and others are as 'crosstalk' biologically-relevant to cellular physiology, leading to synergy effects more than additive responses in an entire organism. Effort is now required to determine which interactions truly contribute to final physiological output. A receptor is the prime example of connectors among the networks. It functions, not simply as a signaling gateway, but also as an active trader by forming inter-receptor dimers. Furthermore, various receptors can modulate the function of the other receptors by input to common intracellular signaling pathways, establishing functional crosstalk among networks. Our findings by combined analyses of gene polymorphisms of two separate genes present evidences that such is the case with human body in a clinical setting: 1) an integrated effect of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and protease activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) on susceptibility to airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and 2) a crosstalk effect between muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChRs) and β(2) adrenoceptor (β(2)AR) on bronchodilatory response to anticholinergic agents in patients with COPD. These results indicate that these interactions are unlikely to be 'noise' but functionally-relevant 'crosstalk' in a human body. This review attempts to highlight the clinically-relevant 'crosstalk' paradigm in a human body which provides us a novel insight necessary to investigate pathophysiology in common multifactorial diseases and to develop new drugs.
23318685	CHEMICALNOTIN clearance, distribution, metabolism, and excretion in monkeys following intravenous administration. CHEMICALIN, a CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)ylated peptide-based erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, stimulates the GENEIN dimer that governs erythropoiesis. Studies were designed to determine the erythropoietic response, pharmacokinetics (PK), tissue distribution, metabolism, and excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN in nonhuman primates following a single i.v. dose. The PK profile of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1-5 mg/kg) is characterized by low, dose-dependent plasma clearance; small volume of distribution; and long half-life. The CHEMICALNOTIN PK profile following a single i.v. dose is consistent with the sustained erythropoiesis. Biodistribution quantitative whole-body autoradiography demonstrated high CHEMICALNOTIN levels in bone marrow (i.e., primary hematopoietic site) as well as other known hematopoietic sites persisting through at least 3 weeks at 2.1 mg/kg. Microautoradiography analysis at 48 hours postdose revealed uniform and high distribution of radioactivity in the bone marrow and splenic red pulp with less extensive distribution in the renal cortex (glomeruli, associated ducts, interstitial cells). Radioactivity in the kidney was most prominent in the outer medullary and papillary interstitium. At 2 weeks after dosing, cumulative radioactivity recovery in the urine and feces was 60 and 7% of the administered dose, respectively, with most of the radioactivity associated with the parent molecule. In conclusion, the PK characteristics are consistent with a PEGylated peptide of a 45-kDa molecular mass, specifically low volume of distribution and long half-life. Drug was localized principally to hematopoietic sites, and nonspecific tissue retention was not observed. The nonhuman primate data indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN is metabolically stable and primarily excreted in the urine.
23319584	Comparison of orientation and rotational motion of skeletal muscle cross-bridges containing GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN binding to thin filaments is a major element controlling active force generation in striated muscles. Recent evidence suggests that processes other than CHEMICALNOTIN binding, such as phosphorylation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) also controls contraction of vertebrate striated muscle (Cooke, R. (2011) Biophys. Rev. 3, 33-45). Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies using CHEMICALIN analog spin label probes showed that GENEIN heads are highly ordered in the relaxed fibers and have very low GENEIN activity. This ordered structure of GENENOTIN cross-bridges disappears with the phosphorylation of RLC (Stewart, M. (2010) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 107, 430-435). The slower GENENOTIN activity in the dephosporylated moiety has been defined as a new super-relaxed state (SRX). It can be observed in both skeletal and cardiac muscle fibers (Hooijman, P., Stewart, M. A., and Cooke, R. (2011) Biophys. J. 100, 1969-1976). Given the importance of the finding that suggests a novel pathway of regulation of skeletal muscle, we aim to examine the effects of phosphorylation on cross-bridge orientation and rotational motion. We find that: (i) relaxed cross-bridges, but not active ones, are statistically better ordered in muscle where the GENENOTIN is dephosporylated compared with GENENOTIN; (ii) relaxed phosphorylated and dephosphorylated cross-bridges rotate equally slowly; and (iii) active phosphorylated cross-bridges rotate considerably faster than dephosphorylated ones during isometric contraction but the duty cycle remained the same, suggesting that both phosphorylated and dephosphorylated muscles develop the same isometric tension at full CHEMICALNOTIN saturation. A simple theory was developed to account for this fact.
23322166	GENENOTIN-induced cytoskeleton reorganization drives fibrosis through GENENOTIN-dependent fibroblast proliferation. There has been much recent interest in CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) signaling through one of its receptors, GENEIN, in fibrotic diseases, but the mechanisms by which CHEMICALIN-GENEIN signaling promotes pathological fibrosis remain to be fully elucidated. Using a mouse peritoneal fibrosis model, we demonstrate central roles for CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN in fibroblast proliferation. Genetic deletion or pharmacological antagonism of GENENOTIN protected mice from peritoneal fibrosis, blunting the increases in peritoneal GENENOTIN by 65.4 and 52.9%, respectively, compared to control animals and demonstrated that peritoneal fibroblast proliferation was highly GENENOTIN dependent. Activation of GENENOTIN on mesothelial cells induced these cells to express GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), driving fibroblast proliferation in a paracrine fashion. Activation of mesothelial cell GENENOTIN induced GENENOTIN expression by inducing cytoskeleton reorganization in these cells, causing nuclear translocation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Pharmacological inhibition of GENENOTIN-induced transcription also diminished GENENOTIN expression and fibrosis in the peritoneal fibrosis model, mitigating the increase in peritoneal GENENOTIN content by 57.9% compared to controls. GENENOTIN-induced cytoskeleton reorganization therefore makes a previously unrecognized but critically important contribution to the profibrotic activities of CHEMICALIN by driving GENEIN-dependent GENEIN expression, which, in turn, drives fibroblast proliferation.-Sakai, N., Chun, J., Duffield, J. S., Wada, T., Luster, A. D., Tager, A. M. GENENOTIN-induced cytoskeleton reorganization drives fibrosis through GENENOTIN-dependent fibroblast proliferation.
23327532	Cooperative effects for GENEIN differ between CHEMICALIN and its metabolites. Abstract 1. Cooperative interactions are frequently observed in the metabolism of drugs and pollutants by GENENOTIN; nevertheless, the molecular determinants for cooperativity remain elusive. Previously, we demonstrated that steady-state styrene metabolism by GENENOTIN exhibits positive cooperativity. 2. We hypothesized that CHEMICALIN metabolites have lower affinity than CHEMICALIN toward GENEIN and limited ability to induce cooperative effects during metabolism. To test the hypothesis, we determined the potency and mechanism of inhibition for CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolites toward oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN using GENENOTIN Supersomes® and human liver microsomes. 3. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the reaction through a mixed cooperative mechanism with high affinity for the catalytic site (67 µM) and lower affinity for the cooperative site (1100 µM), while increasing substrate turnover at high concentrations. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN possessed similar affinity for GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN behaved cooperatively like CHEMICALNOTIN, but CHEMICALNOTIN decreased turnover at high concentrations. CHEMICALNOTIN was a very poor competitive inhibitor. Among all compounds, there was a positive correlation with binding and hydrophobicity. 4. Taken together, these findings for GENENOTIN further validate contributions of cooperative mechanisms to metabolic processes, demonstrate the role of molecular structure on those mechanisms and underscore the potential for heterotropic cooperative effects between different compounds.
23329465	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: current issues and novel treatment approaches. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is considered the most common liver disorder in the Western world. It is commonly associated with insulin resistance, obesity, dyslipidaemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular disease. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by steatosis with necroinflammation and eventual fibrosis, which can lead to end-stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. Its pathogenesis is complex, and involves a state of 'lipotoxicity' in which insulin resistance, with increased free fatty acid release from adipose tissue to the liver, play a key role in the onset of a 'lipotoxic liver disease' and its progression to NASH. The diagnosis of NASH is challenging, as most affected patients are symptom free and the role of routine screening is not clearly established. A complete medical history is important to rule out other causes of fatty liver disease (alcohol abuse, medications, other). Plasma aminotransferase levels and liver ultrasound are helpful in the diagnosis of NAFLD/NASH, but a liver biopsy is often required for a definitive diagnosis. However, there is an active search for plasma biomarkers and imaging techniques that may non-invasively aid in the diagnosis. The treatment of NASH requires a multifaceted approach. The goal is to reverse obesity-associated lipotoxicity and insulin resistance via lifestyle intervention. Although there is no pharmacological agent approved for the treatment of NAFLD, vitamin E (in patients without T2DM) and the thiazolidinedione pioglitazone (in patients with and without T2DM) have shown the most consistent results in randomized controlled trials. This review concentrates on our current understanding of the disease, with a focus on the existing therapeutic approaches and potential future pharmacological developments for NAFLD and NASH.
23330546	GENENOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. CHEMICALIN are signaling molecules that activate GENEIN, such as GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, and play a critical role in the regulation of lipid, CHEMICALNOTIN, energy, and drug metabolism. These GENENOTIN regulate phase I oxidation, phase II conjugation, and phase III transport in CHEMICALNOTIN and drug metabolism in the digestive system. Integration of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism with drug metabolism controls absorption, transport, and metabolism of nutrients and drugs to maintain metabolic homeostasis and also protects against liver injury, inflammation, and related metabolic diseases, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and obesity. CHEMICALNOTIN-based drugs targeting nuclear receptors are in clinical trials for treating cholestatic liver diseases and fatty liver disease.
23333093	Green tea catechin leads to global improvement among Alzheimer's disease-related phenotypes in NSE/hAPP-C105 Tg mice. Amyloid β (Αβ) has been reported to be responsible for the functional and structural abnormalities of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the induction of oxidative stress. The aim of this study was to determine whether or not treatment of transgenic (Tg) mice with green tea catechin (GTC), a radical scavenger, improves AD phenotypes. To test this, 7-month-old Tg mice were treated with a low (1 mg) or high (10 mg) dose of GTC for 6 months. Surprisingly, GTC-treated Tg mice exhibited significant decreases in behavioral impairment, Aβ-42 production, APP-C99/89 expression, γ-secretase component and Wnt protein levels, γ-secretase activity and MAPK activation. In contrast, the levels of APP-C83 protein and enzyme activities (α-secretase, neprilysin and Pin1) were elevated in the GTC-treated groups. Moreover, GTC-treated groups showed lower levels of total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, whereas the level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol increased. These results provide the first experimental evidence that GTC improves AD phenotypes, thereby suggesting that GTC can be used in the prevention of AD or treatment of AD patients.
23333305	RIF1 is essential for 53BP1-dependent nonhomologous end joining and suppression of DNA double-strand break resection. The appropriate execution of DNA double-strand break (DSB) repair is critical for genome stability and tumor avoidance. 53BP1 and BRCA1 directly influence DSB repair pathway choice by regulating 5' end resection, but how this is achieved remains uncertain. Here we report that Rif1(-/-) mice are severely compromised for 53BP1-dependent class switch recombination (CSR) and fusion of dysfunctional telomeres. The inappropriate accumulation of RIF1 at DSBs in S phase is antagonized by BRCA1, and deletion of Rif1 suppresses toxic nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) induced by PARP inhibition in Brca1-deficient cells. Mechanistically, RIF1 is recruited to DSBs via the N-terminal phospho-SQ/TQ domain of 53BP1, and DSBs generated by ionizing radiation or during CSR are hyperresected in the absence of RIF1. Thus, RIF1 and 53BP1 cooperate to block DSB resection to promote NHEJ in G1, which is antagonized by BRCA1 in S phase to ensure a switch of DSB repair mode to homologous recombination.
23333834	GENENOTIN targeted peptides inhibit osteoclastogenesis and attenuate adjuvant induced arthritis by inhibiting GENENOTIN activation and down regulating inflammatory GENENOTIN. Peptides designed from osteoprotegerin (OPG) have previously been shown to inhibit GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and prevent bone loss without significantly inhibiting inflammation. The objective of this study was to develop a novel peptide with dual inhibitory activity against bone loss and inflammation using site-directed mutagenesis. Out of the three putative sites (i.e., CHEMICALNOTIN70-CHEMICALNOTIN78, CHEMICALNOTIN82-CHEMICALNOTIN96, and CHEMICALNOTIN113-CHEMICALNOTIN122) available on OPG for GENENOTIN binding, CHEMICALNOTIN113-CHEMICALNOTIN122 was used as a template for peptide synthesis. Peptide mutants of the template sequence (112YLEIEFCLKHR122) were synthesized and initially screened for their inhibitory effect on GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN binding by competitive ELISA. The most active peptide was further evaluated in vitro for GENENOTIN induced osteoclastogenesis in mouse macrophage cells, and in vivo for Freund's complete adjuvant induced arthritis (AIA) in Lewis rats. The efficacy of the candidate peptide was compared with that of the standard drug CHEMICALNOTIN. The peptide CHEMICALIN (YLEIEFSLKHR), obtained by direct substitution of CHEMICALIN with a CHEMICALIN residue in the template sequence, significantly (p<0.05) inhibited GENEIN-GENEIN binding, and GENEIN induced GENEIN activity and formation of multinucleated osteoclasts without any cytotoxicity. Administration of CHEMICALNOTIN peptide at the dose of 30mg/kg (i.p.) ameliorated both bone loss and inflammation in AIA rats. To elucidate the mechanism for inhibition of inflammation in arthritic rats, serum and tissue GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) were analyzed by ELISA and RT-PCR methods. Results confirmed that CHEMICALIN peptide inhibited pro-inflammatory GENEIN in the sera and hind paw tissues of AIA rats through its suppressive effect on GENEIN induced nuclear translocation of GENEIN. The results obtained in this study substantiate the therapeutic benefit of this novel peptide in the prevention of bone loss and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis with reduced side effects.
23333897	Activation of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN by nanoparticulate structures in human macrophages. Inflammatory activation of alveolar macrophages by ambient particles can be facilitated via GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The action of GENENOTIN agonists and antagonists has been reported to depend on the formation of nanoparticulate structures. Aim of the present study was to identify the signaling pathways induced by nanoparticulate structures in human macrophages, which might be critical for inflammatory cell activation. METHODS: Studies were performed in primary human alveolar macrophages or in differentiated THP-1 macrophages. CHEMICALNOTIN nanoparticles were prepared by Stöber synthesis and characterized by dynamic light scattering and scanning electron microscopy. Mycobacterial DNA was isolated from Mycobacterium bovis BCG, and nanoparticle formation was assessed by atomic force microscopy and dynamic light scattering. GENENOTIN polymerization was measured by CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN staining, and cell activation was determined by reverse transcription quantitative PCR analysis, L929 cytotoxicity assay (GENENOTIN induction), and pull-down assays (GENENOTIN GENENOTIN). RESULTS: In contrast to immune stimulatory sequence ISS 1018, BCG DNA spontaneously formed nanoparticulate structures and induced GENEIN polymerization as did synthetic CHEMICALIN nanoparticles. Co-incubation with CHEMICALNOTIN nanoparticles amplified the responsiveness of macrophages toward the GENENOTIN ligand ISS 1018. The activation of GENEIN was induced by CHEMICALIN nanoparticles as well as BCG DNA and is suggested as the critical signaling event inducing both cytoskeleton changes as well as inflammatory cell activation. CONCLUSION: Nanoparticles can induce signaling pathways, which amplify an inflammatory response in macrophages.
23336337	Enhancing macrocyclic CHEMICALNOTIN as multidrug-resistance reversers: structure-activity studies on CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives. The phytochemical study of Euphorbia piscatoria yielded CHEMICALNOTIN (1) in a large amount, whose derivatization gave rise to 12 CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives (2-13) and hydrolysis to compound 14. The in vitro modulation of GENENOTIN of compounds 1-14 was evaluated through a combination of transport and chemosensitivity assays, using the L5178 mouse T lymphoma cell line transfected with the GENENOTIN gene. Apart from CHEMICALNOTIN, all derivatives (2-14) showed potential as MDR reversal agents. In this small library of novel bioactive macrocyclic CHEMICALIN derivatives, designed to evaluate structure-activity relationships essential in overcoming multidrug resistance (MDR), some correlations between MDR reversal and molecular weight, accessible solvent areas, and CHEMICALNOTIN/water partition coefficient were identified that can contribute to the development of new selective GENEIN reversal agents.
23337567	Osteoblasts survive the CHEMICALIN treatment by activation of GENEIN-mediated pathway. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is widely used in tumor treatment, but excessive CHEMICALNOTIN exposure can have adverse effects. We recently found that, in primary osteoblasts, CHEMICALNOTIN produces oxidative stress and causes DNA tailing, but does not induce apoptosis. We further examined the signaling pathway by which osteoblasts survive CHEMICALNOTIN treatment, and found that they were arrested at G2/M phase of the cell cycle at 30h and overrode the G2/M boundary at 48h. After treatment for 30h, there was increased GENENOTIN phosphorylation and expression of GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, and expression of the cell cycle inhibitor, GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN), which interacts with GENENOTIN. Furthermore, levels of the GENENOTIN, which activates GENENOTIN, were decreased, while the ratio of its phosphorylated/inactivated form to the total amount was increased. Moreover, phosphorylation/activation of the checkpoint kinases GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels were increased, as were levels of activated GENENOTIN and γ-GENENOTIN. The cell viability was decreased as an GENENOTIN inhibitor was added. Additionally, these effects of CHEMICALIN on γ-GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN(GENEIN/GENEIN) were reduced by an GENEIN inhibitor. These findings suggest that G2/M phase arrest of osteoblasts is mediated by GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN activation via an GENENOTIN-dependent pathway by which osteoblasts survive.
23339076	Structure prediction of binary pernitride MN2 compounds (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, La, and Ti). Metal-pernitride compounds belong to a class of chemical systems in which both the complex ions and the non-bonding electrons may play roles in the formation of their modified crystalline structures. To investigate this issue, the energy landscapes of pernitrides of metals with different maximum valence (M=Ca, Sr, Ba, La, and Ti) were globally explored on the ab initio level at standard and high pressures, thereby yielding possible (meta)stable modifications in these systems together with information on how the landscape changed as function of the valence of the metal cation. For all of the systems in which no compounds had been synthesized so far, we predicted the existence of kinetically stable modifications that should, in principle, be experimentally accessible. In particular, TiN2 should crystallize in a new structure type, TiN2-I.
23340897	25-Hydroxyvitamin D in Obese Youth Across the Spectrum of Glucose Tolerance From Normal to Prediabetes to Type 2 Diabetes. OBJECTIVETo 1) determine if plasma 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations differ among obese youth with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) versus prediabetes versus type 2 diabetes, and 2) assess the relationships between 25(OH)D and in vivo insulin sensitivity and β-cell function in this cohort.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSPlasma 25(OH)D concentrations were examined in banked specimens in 9- to 20-year-old obese youth (n = 175; male 42.3%, black 46.3%) (NGT, n = 105; impaired glucose tolerance [IGT], n = 43; type 2 diabetes, n = 27) who had in vivo insulin sensitivity and secretion measured by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp techniques and had an assessment of total body composition and abdominal adiposity.RESULTSThe mean age and BMI of the subjects were 14.3 ± 2.1 years and 35.7 ± 5.6 kg/m(2), respectively. BMI, plasma 25(OH)D, and the proportion of vitamin D-deficient and -insufficient children did not differ across the three groups. Furthermore, there was no association between 25(OH)D and in vivo insulin sensitivity or β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity (disposition index) in all groups combined or in each group separately.CONCLUSIONSOur data in obese youth show 1) no differences in plasma 25(OH)D concentrations across the glucose tolerance groups, and 2) no relationship between 25(OH)D and in vivo insulin sensitivity and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity in any of the groups. It remains uncertain if enhancement of the vitamin D status could improve pathophysiological mechanisms of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes in obese youth.
23343565	Binary diffusion coefficients for mixtures of ionic liquids [EMIM][N(CN)2], [EMIM][NTf2], and [HMIM][NTf2] with acetone and ethanol by dynamic light scattering (DLS). Mutual diffusivities for binary mixtures of the ionic liquids (ILs) [EMIM][N(CN)2] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium dicyanimide), [EMIM][NTf2] (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide), and [HMIM][NTf2] (1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) with acetone and ethanol were studied in dependence on composition in the temperature range from 283.15 to 323.15 K, applying dynamic light scattering (DLS). The influence of experimental parameters on the achievable uncertainties was analyzed to ensure the acquisition of accurate data in adequate measurement times. For all probed systems, increasing binary diffusion coefficients were found for increasing temperatures. The systematic variation of anion and cation of the investigated ILs as well as a comparison with the literature data demonstrates the considerable influence of different ions on the resulting binary diffusion coefficients. Mutual diffusivities were found to be lower for the mixtures with ethanol than for those with acetone, which could be related to the formation of hydrogen bonds between ethanol and the ions. Most of the investigated IL solvent mixtures show increasing binary diffusion coefficients with increasing solvent concentration. For the mixtures of [EMIM][NTf2] with ethanol, however, a minimum of the mutual diffusivities was found in the ethanol mole fraction range from 0.7 to 0.8, which may hint at the vicinity of a critical demixing point. The viscosity of the pure ILs turned out to be no reliable indicator for the mutual diffusivity in mixtures with the same solvent.
23347547	Quercetin-loaded microcapsules ameliorate experimental colitis in mice by anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. Quercetin (1) is an anti-inflammatory and antioxidant flavonoid. However, the oral administration of 1 did not lead to beneficial effects in experimental animal colitis models, which involve cytokines and oxidative stress. A possible explanation is that the absorption profile of 1 prevents its activity. Therefore, it was reasoned that the controlled release of 1 would improve its therapeutic effect. Thus, the therapeutic effect and mechanisms of 1-loaded microcapsules in acetic acid-induced colitis in mice were evaluated. Microcapsules were prepared using pectin/casein polymer and 1. The oral administration of 1-loaded microcapsules decreased neutrophil recruitment, attenuated histological alterations, and reduced macroscopical damage, edema, and IL-1β and IL-33 production in the colon samples. Microcapsules loaded with 1 also prevented the reduction of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the antioxidant capacity of the colon. These preclinical data indicate that pectin/casein polymer microcapsules loaded with 1 improved the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of 1 compared to the nonencapsulated drug. Therefore, quercetin seems to be a promising active molecule in inflammatory bowel disease if provided with adequate controlled release.
23348407	Dietary relevant mixtures of phytoestrogens inhibit adipocyte differentiation in vitro. Phytoestrogens (PEs) are naturally occurring plant components, with the ability to induce biological responses in vertebrates by mimicking or modulating the action of endogenous hormones. Single CHEMICALNOTIN have been shown to affect adipocyte differentiation, but knowledge on the effect of dietary relevant mixtures of PEs, including for instance lignans, is lacking. In the current study dietary relevant mixtures of CHEMICALNOTIN and their metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN and their metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN, and a mixture containing all of them, were examined for effects on adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, as well as tested for their GENENOTIN activating abilities. The results showed that mixtures of CHEMICALNOTIN parent compounds and metabolites, respectively, a mixture of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites, as well as CHEMICALNOTIN concentration-dependently inhibited adipocyte differentiation. Furthermore, a mixture of CHEMICALIN parent compounds, and a mixture of CHEMICALIN metabolites were found to have GENEIN activating abilities. These results suggest that PEs can affect pathways known to play a role in obesity development, and indicate that the inhibitory effect on adipocyte differentiation does not appear to be strictly associated with GENENOTIN activation/inhibition. The current study support the hypothesis that compounds with endocrine activity can affect pathways playing a role in the development obesity and obesity related diseases.
23348408	Anti-inflammatory activity of patchouli alcohol in RAW264.7 and HT-29 cells. Patchouli alcohol (PA) is a chemical compound extracted from patchouli which belongs to the genus Pogostemon, herb of mint family. Recently, it has been reported that PA inhibits the production of inflammatory mediators. However, the biological mechanisms of PA for anti-inflammatory activities have not been studied. In this study, we investigated whether PA decreases the production of inflammatory mediators through downregulation of the NF-κB and ERK pathway. Our data indicated that PA inhibits the over-expression of iNOS and IL-6 in protein and mRNA levels in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-α stimulated HT-29 cells. PA inhibited IκB-α degradation and p65 nuclear translocation, and subsequently suppressed transcriptional activity of NF-κB in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 and TNF-α-stimulated HT-29 cells. In addition, PA inhibited LPS- or TNF-α-stimulated ERK1/2 activation by decreasing phosphorylation of ERK1/2. These findings suggest that PA shows anti-inflammatory activities through suppressing ERK-mediated NF-κB pathway in mouse macrophage and human colorectal cancer cells.
23349208	Evaluation of suppressive and pro-resolving effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in human primary monocytes and T-helper cells. Despite their beneficial anti-inflammatory properties, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) may increase the infection risk at high doses, likely by generating an immune-depressed state. To assess the contribution of different immune cell populations to the immunomodulatory CHEMICALNOTIN effect, we comparatively investigated several aspects of inflammation in human T-helper (Th) cells and monocytes. Both CHEMICALIN, but CHEMICALIN to a lesser extent compared with CHEMICALIN, selectively and dose-dependently reduced the percentage of GENEIN-expressing Th cells in a GENEIN-dependent fashion, whereas the expression of the cell surface marker GENEIN was unaltered on activated T cells. In monocytes, both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN increased GENEIN without affecting GENEIN and GENEIN. Cellular incorporation of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN occurred mainly at the expense of CHEMICALNOTIN. Concomitantly, CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN in supernatants decreased, while levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN increased. This increase was independent of activation and in accordance with GENENOTIN expression patterns in monocytes. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN gave rise to a variety of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives of highly anti-inflammatory potential, such as CHEMICALNOTIN and their precursors. Our results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN do not generally affect immune cell functions in an inhibitory manner but rather promote pro-resolving responses.
23352910	Cell penetrating peptide tethered bi-ligand liposomes for delivery to brain in vivo: Biodistribution and transfection. Targeted nano-particulate systems hold extraordinary potential for delivery of therapeutics across blood brain barrier (BBB). In this work, we investigated the potential of novel bi-ligand (transferrin-poly-l-arginine) liposomal vector for delivery of desired gene to brain, in vivo. The in vivo evaluation of the delivery vectors is essential for clinical translation. We followed an innovative approach of combining transferrin receptor targeting with enhanced cell penetration to design liposomal vectors for improving the transport of molecules into brain. The biodistribution profile of 1, 1'-dioctadecyl-3,3,3',3'-tetramethyl-indocarbocyanine iodide(DiR)-labeled liposomes was evaluated in adult rats after single intravenous injection at dose of 15.2μmoles of phospholipids/kg body weight. We demonstrated that bi-ligand liposomes accumulated in rat brain at significantly (p<0.05) higher concentrations as compared to the single-ligand (transferrin) or plain liposomes. In addition, the bi-ligand liposomes resulted in increased expression of β-galactosidase(β-gal) plasmid in rat brain tissue in comparison to the single-ligand liposomes. Histological examination of the transfected tissues did not show any signs of tissue necrosis or inflammation. Hemolysis assay further authenticated the biocompatibility of bi-ligand liposomes in blood up to 600 nmoles of phospholipids/1.4×10(7) erythrocytes. The findings of this study provide important and detailed information regarding the distribution of bi-ligand liposomes in vivo and accentuate their ability to demonstrate improved brain penetration and transfection potential over single-ligand liposomes.
23352911	Encapsulation of Nod1 and Nod2 receptor ligands into poly(lactic acid) nanoparticles potentiates their immune properties. Most successful vaccines are able to induce persistent antibody responses that can last a lifetime. Emerging evidences indicate that activation of immune cells through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or Nod-like receptors (NLRs) may be critical mechanisms. Among PRRs, the use of TLR ligands as adjuvants is already largely described whereas the use of NLRs ligands remains largely unexplored. As activation of intracytoplasmic NLRs is able to induce proinflammatory molecules, the added value of encapsulation of Nod1 and Nod2 receptor ligands into Poly(Lactic Acid) (PLA) biodegradable nanocarriers to modulate their immune properties on human dendritic cells (DCs) maturation has been evaluated. Their ability to induce systemic immune responses in mice was also measured and compared to free ligands and the Alum adjuvant. Nod ligands encapsulated into PLA NPs were efficiently taken up by DCs and subsequently induced a strong up-regulation of maturation markers and the enhancement of proinflammatory cytokine secretion by DCs. Furthermore, co-injection of encapsulated Nod-ligands with PLA particles carrying Gag p24 HIV-1 antigen allowed a 100 fold increase in antibody responses in comparison to Alum. These results suggest that encapsulation of Nod ligands into PLA-NPs could be an effective way to improve vaccine efficiency.
23353658	In vitro permeability analysis, pharmacokinetic and brain distribution study in mice of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in Radix Angelicae Dahuricae. CHEMICALNOTIN are important constituents of Radix Angelicae Dahuricae, a well-known traditional Chinese medicine possess several known bioactivities with potentials in the treatment of central nervous system diseases. By using an HPLC-MS/MS method, we analyzed the in vivo plasma and brain pharmacokinetics of three ingredients of CHEMICALNOTIN, including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in mice after oral administration of Dahuricae extract at doses of 800mg/kg. The biosamples were prepared using CHEMICALNOTIN precipitation and the separation was achieved on an XDB-C18 column by gradient elution. The BBB permeability and GENENOTIN-mediated efflux were further examined in Madin Canine kidney cells transfected with full length cDNA for GENENOTIN (MDCKII-GENENOTIN). Our results demonstrate that the method has excellent and satisfactory selectivity, sensitivity, linearity, precision, and accuracy for simultaneous determination of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The pharmacokinetics parameters were determined by using noncompartmental analyses, including the AUC(0-t) in plasma (1695.22, 1326.45 and 636.98mg*h/L), the AUC(0-t) in brain (1812.35, 2125.17 and 1145.83ng*h/g) as well as the T1/2 in plasma (0.66, 0.82, 0.97h) and brain (0.96, 1.1, 0.99h) for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively, suggesting that the three CHEMICALNOTIN could easily pass through the BBB in vivo. In the in vitro model we observed high permeability of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN with the GENEIN-mediated efflux ratios of 0.53 and 0.06, as well as medium permeability of CHEMICALIN with 0.82. All data suggest that these three CHEMICALNOTIN have high BBB permeability and have pharmacokinetic potentials for the treatment of central nervous system diseases.
23353701	Involvement of GENEIN and the GENEIN cytoskeleton in the antitumorigenic action of CHEMICALIN. Transmethylation is an important reaction that transfers a CHEMICALNOTIN group in CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) to substrates such as DNA, RNA, and proteins. It is known that transmethylation plays critical roles in various cellular responses. In this study, we examined the effects of transmethylation on tumorigenic responses and its regulatory mechanism using an upregulation strategy of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) acting as a negative feedback inhibitor. Treatment with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an inhibitor of transmethylation-suppressive GENEIN (GENEIN), enhanced the level of CHEMICALIN and effectively blocked the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells; the treatment also induced the differentiation of C6 glioma cells and suppressed the neovascular genesis of eggs in a dose-dependent manner. Through immunoblotting analysis, it was found that CHEMICALIN was capable of indirectly diminishing the phosphorylation of oncogenic GENEIN and its GENEIN activity. Interestingly, CHEMICALIN disrupted GENEIN cytoskeleton structures, leading to morphological changes, and suppressed the formation of a signaling complex composed of GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN, which is linked to various tumorigenic responses. In agreement with these data, the exogenous treatment of CHEMICALIN or inhibition of GENEIN by specific siRNA or another type of inhibitor, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), similarly resulted in antitumorigenic responses, suppressive activity on GENEIN, the alteration of GENEIN cytoskeleton, and a change of the colocalization pattern between GENEIN and GENEIN. Taken together, these results suggest that CHEMICALIN/GENENOTIN-mediated transmethylation could be linked to the tumorigenic processes through cross-regulation between the GENEIN cytoskeleton and GENEIN GENEIN activity.
23353736	Synthesis of derivatives of CHEMICALIN and their inhibitory activities against GENEIN (GENEIN). A series of GENEIN inhibitors have been identified based upon a CHEMICALIN scaffold using structure-based drug design methods. The best compound in the series showed an IC50 value of 0.4 μM. A docking study was conducted for compound (S)-10n in order to investigate its binding interactions with GENENOTIN. The structure-activity relationships (SAR) were also briefly discussed. Useful SAR was established which provides important guidelines for the design of future generations of potent inhibitors against GENENOTIN.
23353741	Synthesis and biological evaluation of some novel CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives as potential anti-tumor agents. Three series of novel CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives (1a-q, 2a-h, 3a-l) were synthesized and evaluated for their biological activities. All compounds were characterized by CHEMICALNOTIN NMR, CHEMICALNOTIN NMR, MS and elemental analysis. Furthermore, compound 3e was also characterized by X-ray crystallography. All the compounds were evaluated for their anti-tumor activity against MCF-7, A549 and B16-F10 tumor cell lines as well as GENEIN (GENEIN)-derived CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) inhibitory activity of murine macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Among them, compounds 1c, 1g and 3e displayed the most potent GENENOTIN inhibitory activity with the IC50 values of 1.02, 1.27 and 1.98 μM, respectively. Molecular docking studies were performed to position compounds 1c and 3e into the active site of GENENOTIN to determine the probable binding modes.
23353821	Cystathionase mediates senescence evasion in melanocytes and melanoma cells. The development of malignant melanoma is a highly complex process, which is still poorly understood. A majority of human melanomas are found to express a few oncogenic proteins, such as mutant RAS and BRAF variants. However, these oncogenes are also found in nevi, and it is now a well-accepted fact that their expression alone leads to senescence. This renders the understanding of senescence escape mechanisms an important point to understand tumor development. Here, we approached the question of senescence evasion by expressing the transcription factor v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-MYC), which is known to act synergistically with many oncogenes, in melanocytes. We observed that MYC drives the evasion of reactive-oxygen stress-induced melanocyte senescence, caused by activated receptor tyrosine kinase signaling. Conversely, MIZ1, the growth suppressing interaction partner of MYC, is involved in mediating melanocyte senescence. Both, MYC overexpression and Miz1 knockdown led to a strong reduction of endogenous reactive-oxygen species (ROS), DNA damage and senescence. We identified the cystathionase (CTH) gene product as mediator of the ROS-related MYC and MIZ1 effects. Blocking CTH enzymatic activity in MYC-overexpressing and Miz1 knockdown cells increased intracellular stress and senescence. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of CTH in human melanoma cells also reconstituted senescence in the majority of cell lines, and CTH knockdown reduced tumorigenic effects such as proliferation, H(2)O(2) resistance and soft agar growth. Thus, we identified CTH as new MYC target gene with an important function in senescence evasion.Oncogene advance online publication, 28 January 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2012.641.
23354728	Investigational anti-hyperglycemic agents: the future of type 2 diabetes therapy? As the pandemic of type 2 diabetes spreads globally, clinicians face many challenges in treating an increasingly diverse patient population varying in age, comorbidities, and socioeconomic status. Current therapies for type 2 diabetes are often unable to alter the natural course of the disease and provide durable glycemic control, and side effects in the context of individual patient characteristics often limit treatment choices. This often results in the progression to insulin use and complex regimens that are difficult to maintain. Therefore, a number of agents are being developed to better address the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and to overcome limitations of current therapies. The hope is to provide more options for glucose lowering and complication reduction with less risk for hypoglycemia and other adverse effects. These agents include newer incretin-based therapies and PPAR agonists, as well as new therapeutic classes such as sodium-coupled glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, free fatty acid receptor agonists, 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 inhibitors, glucokinase activators, and several others that may enter clinical use over the next decade. Herein we review these agents that are advancing through clinical trials and describe the rationale behind their use, mechanisms of action, and potential for glucose lowering, as well as what is known of their limitations.
23355087	3-Methylglutaconic aciduria-lessons from 50 genes and 977 patients. Elevated urinary excretion of 3-methylglutaconic acid is considered rare in patients suspected of a metabolic disorder. In 3-methylglutaconyl-CoA hydratase deficiency (mutations in AUH), it derives from leucine degradation. In all other disorders with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria the origin is unknown, yet mitochondrial dysfunction is thought to be the common denominator. We investigate the biochemical, clinical and genetic data of 388 patients referred to our centre under suspicion of a metabolic disorder showing 3-methylglutaconic aciduria in routine metabolic screening. Furthermore, we investigate 591 patients with 50 different, genetically proven, mitochondrial disorders for the presence of 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. Three percent of all urine samples of the patients referred showed 3-methylglutaconic aciduria, often in correlation with disorders not reported earlier in association with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria (e.g. organic acidurias, urea cycle disorders, haematological and neuromuscular disorders). In the patient cohort with genetically proven mitochondrial disorders 11 % presented 3-methylglutaconic aciduria. It was more frequently seen in ATPase related disorders, with mitochondrial DNA depletion or deletion, but not in patients with single respiratory chain complex deficiencies. Besides, it was a consistent feature of patients with mutations in TAZ, SERAC1, OPA3, DNAJC19 and TMEM70 accounting for mitochondrial membrane related pathology. 3-methylglutaconic aciduria is found quite frequently in patients suspected of a metabolic disorder, and mitochondrial dysfunction is indeed a common denominator. It is only a discriminative feature of patients with mutations in AUH, TAZ, SERAC1, OPA3, DNAJC19 TMEM70. These conditions should therefore be referred to as inborn errors of metabolism with 3-methylglutaconic aciduria as discriminative feature.
23356880	Bioactives and nutraceutical phytochemicals naturally occurring in virgin olive oil. The case study of the Nocellara del Belice Italian olive cultivar. This work reports on the composition and bionutritional value of organic virgin olive oil from the Nocellara del Belice variety, one cultivated in the olive areas of the Sicily region, Italy. Destoned oils obtained by processing olives with a destoning-based procedure were compared with conventional oils. This innovative technique, consisting in removing the stone from fruits prior to processing, strongly enhanced the already high-quality level of the conventional product. An in-depth analytical investigation from 2008 to 2010 showed how this innovative olive extraction process led to an excellent peculiar final product, mainly attributable to the improved biophenol and volatile composition, as well as higher concentrations of the lipophilic and vitamin antioxidants (CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN). It had higher levels of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a nutraceutical compound exerting actions against GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN). Its head-space aroma displayed new volatile phytomolecules and also had higher levels of green volatiles from the GENEIN (GENEIN)-pathway (one having as precursors the CHEMICALIN containing a CHEMICALIN system). Among the other bioactives, we highlight its significant levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and other carotenoids). Its enhanced nutritional value was also attributable to the increased intensity of valuable tasting notes.
23358307	Synthesis, DNA binding and antitumor evaluation of styelsamine and cystodytin analogues. A series of N-14 sidechain substituted analogues of styelsamine (pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridine) and cystodytin (pyrido[4,3,2-mn]acridin-4-one) alkaloids have been prepared and evaluated for their DNA binding affinity and antiproliferative activity towards a panel of human tumor cell lines. Overall it was found that styelsamine analogues were stronger DNA binders, with the natural products styelsamines B and D having particularly high affinity (K(app) 5.33 × 10(6) and 3.64 × 10(6) M(-1), respectively). In comparison, the cystodytin iminoquinone alkaloids showed lower affinity for DNA, but were typically just as active as styelsamine analogues at inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells in vitro. Sub-panel selectivity towards non-small cell lung, melanoma and renal cancer cell lines were observed for a number of the analogues. Correlation was observed between whole cell activity and clogP, with the most potent antiproliferative activity being observed for 3-phenylpropanamide analogues 37 and 41 (NCI panel average GI(50) 0.4 μM and 0.32 μM, respectively) with clogP ~4.0-4.5.
23362838	Intercalation pathway in many-particle LiFePO4 electrode revealed by nanoscale state-of-charge mapping. The intercalation pathway of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) in the positive electrode of a lithium-ion battery was probed at the ∼40 nm length scale using oxidation-state-sensitive X-ray microscopy. Combined with morphological observations of the same exact locations using transmission electron microscopy, we quantified the local state-of-charge of approximately 450 individual LFP particles over nearly the entire thickness of the porous electrode. With the electrode charged to 50% state-of-charge in 0.5 h, we observed that the overwhelming majority of particles were either almost completely delithiated or lithiated. Specifically, only ∼2% of individual particles were at an intermediate state-of-charge. From this small fraction of particles that were actively undergoing delithiation, we conclude that the time needed to charge a particle is ∼1/50 the time needed to charge the entire particle ensemble. Surprisingly, we observed a very weak correlation between the sequence of delithiation and the particle size, contrary to the common expectation that smaller particles delithiate before larger ones. Our quantitative results unambiguously confirm the mosaic (particle-by-particle) pathway of intercalation and suggest that the rate-limiting process of charging is initiating the phase transformation by, for example, a nucleation-like event. Therefore, strategies for further enhancing the performance of LFP electrodes should not focus on increasing the phase-boundary velocity but on the rate of phase-transformation initiation.
23363425	Silica precipitation by synthetic minicollagens. Oligomeric Pro-Hyp-Gly- (POG-) peptides, wherein the collagenous triple helix is supported by C-terminal capping, exhibit silica precipitation properties (O, Hyp = (2S,4R)hydroxyproline). As quantified by a molybdate assay, the length of the covalently tethered triple helix (number of POG units) determines the amount of amorphous silica obtained from silicic acid solution. Although lacking charged side chains, the synthetic collagens precipitate large quantities of silicic acid resulting in micrometer-sized spheres of varying surface morphologies as analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Similar precipitation efficiencies on a fast time scale of less than 10 min were previously described only for biogenic diatom proteins and sponge collagen, respectively, which have a considerably higher structural complexity and limited accessibility. The minicollagens described here provide an unexpected alternative to the widely used precipitation conditions, which generally depend on (poly-)amines in phosphate buffer. Collagen can form intimate connections with inorganic matter. Hence, silica-enclosed collagens have promising perspectives as composite materials.
23368510	Pharmacodynamic characteristics of lixisenatide once daily versus liraglutide once daily in patients with type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on metformin. AIM: Assess the pharmacodynamics of lixisenatide once daily (QD) versus liraglutide QD in type 2 diabetes insufficiently controlled on metformin. METHODS: In this 28-day, randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicentre study (NCT01175473), patients (mean HbA1c 7.3%) received subcutaneous lixisenatide QD (10 µg weeks 1-2, then 20 µg; n = 77) or liraglutide QD (0.6 mg week 1, 1.2 mg week 2, then 1.8 mg; n = 71) 30 min before breakfast. Primary endpoint was change in postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) exposure from baseline to day 28 during a breakfast test meal. RESULTS: Lixisenatide reduced PPG significantly more than liraglutide [mean change in AUC(0) (:30-4:30h) : -12.6 vs. -4.0 h/mmol/l, respectively; p < 0.0001 (0:30 h = start of meal)]. Change in maximum PPG excursion was -3.9 mmol/l vs. -1.4 mmol/l, respectively (p < 0.0001). More lixisenatide-treated patients achieved 2-h PPG <7.8 mmol/l (69% vs. 29%). Changes in fasting plasma glucose were greater with liraglutide (-0.3 vs. -1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.0001). Lixisenatide provided greater decreases in postprandial glucagon (p < 0.05), insulin (p < 0.0001) and C-peptide (p < 0.0001). Mean HbA1c decreased in both treatment groups (from 7.2% to 6.9% with lixisenatide vs. 7.4% to 6.9% with liraglutide) as did body weight (-1.6 kg vs. -2.4 kg, respectively). Overall incidence of adverse events was lower with lixisenatide (55%) versus liraglutide (65%), with no serious events or hypoglycaemia reported. CONCLUSIONS: Once daily prebreakfast lixisenatide provided a significantly greater reduction in PPG (AUC) during a morning test meal versus prebreakfast liraglutide. Lixisenatide provided significant decreases in postprandial insulin, C-peptide (vs. an increase with liraglutide) and glucagon, and better gastrointestinal tolerability than liraglutide.
23368735	The contrasting activity of CHEMICALIN versus CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN anticancer complexes: control of cell selectivity, cross-resistance, GENEIN dependence, and apoptosis pathway. Organometallic half-sandwich complexes CHEMICALNOTIN where CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, exhibit potent antiproliferative activity toward a range of cancer cells. Not only are the CHEMICALNOTIN complexes more potent than the CHEMICALNOTIN analogues, but they are not cross-resistant with the clinical CHEMICALNOTIN drugs CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. They are also more selective for cancer cells versus normal cells (fibroblasts) and show high accumulation in cell membranes. They arrest cell growth in G1 phase in contrast to CHEMICALNOTIN (S phase) with a high incidence of late-stage apoptosis. The CHEMICALIN complexes retain potency in GENEIN mutant colon cells. All complexes activate GENENOTIN. In general, antiproliferative activity is greatly enhanced by low levels of the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. The work illustrates how subtle changes to the design of low-spin d(6) metal complexes can lead to major changes in cellular metabolism and to potent complexes with novel mechanisms of anticancer activity.
23368743	CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent lysosomal enlargement in GENENOTIN-deficient cells involves GENENOTIN transcription factor and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) transporter. CHEMICALNOTIN is critical for a multitude of cellular processes, including gene expression, secretion and enzymatic activities. Cellular CHEMICALIN is controlled by GENEIN and by GENEIN. The recent identification of CHEMICALIN permeability of the lysosomal GENENOTIN GENEIN (GENEIN), and the evidence of abnormal CHEMICALNOTIN levels in cells deficient in GENENOTIN, suggested a role for GENEIN in CHEMICALIN transport. In the present study we provide new evidence for such a role and identify additional cellular components responsible for it. In agreement with the previously published data, an acute siRNA (small interfering RNA)-driven GENENOTIN KD (knockdown) leads to the build-up of large cytoplasmic vesicles positive for LysoTracker™ and CHEMICALNOTIN staining, when cells are exposed to high concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN. We now show that lysosomal enlargement and CHEMICALNOTIN build-up in GENENOTIN-KD cells exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN are ameliorated by KD of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) or the GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN KD is associated with a build-up of cytoplasmic CHEMICALNOTIN and with enhanced transcriptional response of mRNA for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). GENENOTIN KD did not suppress lysosomal secretion, but it did delay CHEMICALNOTIN leak from the lysosomes into the cytoplasm. These results underscore a role for GENEIN in CHEMICALIN metabolism. Furthermore, they suggest that GENEIN works in concert with GENEIN to regulate CHEMICALIN translocation between the cytoplasm and lysosomes.
23369343	Evaluation of in vivo anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidant potentials of CHEMICALNOTIN and sandalwood oil. Sandalwood finds numerous mentions across diverse traditional medicinal systems in use worldwide. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vivo anti-hyperglycemic and antioxidant potential of sandalwood oil and its major constituent CHEMICALNOTIN. The in vivo anti-hyperglycemic experiment was conducted in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced diabetic male Swiss albino mice models. The in vivo antioxidant experiment was performed in CHEMICALNOTIN mediated oxidative stress induced male Swiss albino mice models. Intraperitoneal administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (100mg/kg BW) and sandalwood oil (1g/kg BW) for an week modulated parameters such as body weight, blood CHEMICALNOTIN, serum CHEMICALNOTIN, liver glycogen, and lipid CHEMICALNOTIN contents to normoglycemic levels in the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced diabetic mice. Similarly, intraperitoneal administration of CHEMICALIN (100mg/kg BW) and sandalwood oil (1g/kg BW) for two weeks modulated parameters such as serum GENEIN, GENEIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, free CHEMICALNOTIN, protein CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, liver lipid CHEMICALNOTIN contents, and antioxidant capacity in CHEMICALNOTIN mediated oxidative stress induced mice. Besides, it was observed that the beneficial effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were well complimented, differentially by other constituents present in sandalwood oil, thus indicating synergism in biological activity of this traditionally used bioresource.
23370008	GENEIN upsurge precedes standard biomarkers of hepatotoxicity in CHEMICALIN-injected mice. The tocolytic agent CHEMICALIN acts on the GENEIN and is an effective treatment option for preterm labor. However, several adverse effects of CHEMICALNOTIN therapy, including liver damage, have been noted. To elucidate the underlying mechanisms of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced adverse effects, development of sensitive biomarkers of these adverse events is necessary. Here, we report the development and analysis of an animal model of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced liver damage. Female mice received daily CHEMICALNOTIN injections for 2 weeks; liver samples were then collected and subjected to DNA microarray analysis. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly altered the expression of genes related to CHEMICALNOTIN and lipid metabolism, as well as the metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN itself. Importantly, expression of the acute-phase reactant GENEIN (GENEIN) significantly increased after CHEMICALIN injection, with values indicating the largest fold-change. This large increase in blood GENENOTIN levels serves as a more sensitive biomarker than conventional liver enzymes, such as GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The increase in GENEIN expression is specific to CHEMICALIN-induced liver damage, because GENEIN expression was not induced by other hepatotoxic drugs such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN. Our in vitro studies showed that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) accumulation was not a primary cause of the CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN increase. Instead, GENENOTIN expression was enhanced by indirect phosphorylation of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mediated by GENENOTIN. Therefore, our study provides a method for sensitive and early detection of hepatic injury, and may thus help preclude serious liver damage due to CHEMICALNOTIN use in preterm labor.
23371303	CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN: a novel CHEMICALNOTIN/GENEIN inhibitor combination. CHEMICALIN (formerly CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is a synthetic non-CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN inhibitor that inhibits the activities of GENENOTIN and some GENEIN enzymes. This review summarizes the existing data published for CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN, including relevant chemistry, mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. Although not a CHEMICALNOTIN, the chemical structure of CHEMICALNOTIN closely resembles portions of the CHEMICALIN bicyclic ring system, and CHEMICALIN has been shown to bond covalently to GENEIN. Very little is known about the potential for CHEMICALNOTIN to select for resistance. The addition of CHEMICALIN greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] reduction) improves the activity of CHEMICALIN versus most species of Enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of GENEIN enzyme(s). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of CHEMICALNOTIN also improves the activity of CHEMICALNOTIN (~fourfold MIC reduction). Limited data suggest that the addition of CHEMICALNOTIN does not improve the activity of CHEMICALNOTIN versus Acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp.). The pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. The maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of CHEMICALNOTIN increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. The mean volume of distribution and half-life of 22 L (~0.3 L/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to CHEMICALNOTIN. Like CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with CHEMICALNOTIN clearance. Pharmacodynamic data suggest that CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN is rapidly bactericidal versus GENEIN-producing Gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by CHEMICALIN alone.Clinical trials to date have reported that CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN is as effective as standard CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant Gram-negative isolates. The safety and tolerability of CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN has been reported in three phase I pharmacokinetic studies and two phase II clinical studies. CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.In conclusion, CHEMICALIN serves to broaden the spectrum of CHEMICALIN versus GENEIN-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The exact roles for CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. Potential future roles for CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant Gram-negative-bacilli producing GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN) and/or GENEIN. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN may be used in combination (with CHEMICALNOTIN) for suspected polymicrobial infections. Finally, the increased activity of CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN versus P. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented P. aeruginosa infections.
23371451	Increased human dermal microvascular endothelial cell survival induced by cysteamine. BACKGROUND: Cystinosis is an autosomal recessive disease caused by intralysosomal cystine accumulation, treated with cysteamine. Recently, new adverse effects of cysteamine were reported. Skin biopsies showed microvascular proliferation (angioendotheliomatosis). To examine the mechanism of angioendotheliomatosis associated with cysteamine toxicity, we examined the effect of cysteamine on human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HDMVEC). METHODS: After cysteamine exposure (range 0-3.0 mM) during 24 h, cell viability was measured using water soluble tetrazolium salt-1 (WST-1) in both control HDMVEC and fibroblasts. Cell proliferation and apoptosis rate were measured in HDMVEC by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation and caspase 3 and caspase 7 activity, respectively. Intracellular glutathione (GSH) was measured in HDMVEC after cysteamine exposure of 0, 0.1 or 1.0 mM. Medium and cysteamine were refreshed every 6 h to mimic the in vivo situation. Next, cell viability in HDMVEC was measured after 24 h of GSH exposure (range 0-10.0 mM). RESULTS: HDMVEC viability and proliferation increased after cysteamine exposure 0.03-3.0 mM (p < 0.01) and 0.03-1.0 mM (p = 0.01) respectively; cell viability in fibroblasts was not affected by incubation with cysteamine. Apoptosis remained unaffected by incubation with 0-1.0 mM cysteamine, 3.0 mM caused increased apoptosis. Intracellular GSH was significantly increased after incubation with cysteamine 0.1 mM (p = 0.02) and 1.0 mM (p < 0.01). HDMVEC viability increased after exposure to GSH 1.0-5.0 mM (p < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Cysteamine concentrations, similar to those described in plasma of cystinosis patients, stimulate HDMVEC viability and proliferation and increase intracellular GSH content. We postulate that this mechanism might underlie angioendotheliomatosis induced by cysteamine.
23372041	Novel locus including FGF21 is associated with dietary macronutrient intake. Dietary intake of macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein, and fat) has been associated with risk of chronic conditions such as obesity and diabetes. Family studies have reported a moderate contribution of genetics to variation in macronutrient intake. In a genome-wide meta-analysis of a population-based discovery cohort (n = 33 533), rs838133 in FGF21 (19q13.33), rs197273 near TRAF family member-associated NF-kappa-B activator (TANK) (2p24.2), and rs10163409 in FTO (16q12.2) were among the top associations (P < 10(-5)) for percentage of total caloric intake from protein and carbohydrate. rs838133 was replicated in silico in an independent sample from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology Consortium (CHARGE) Nutrition Working Group (n = 38 360) and attained genome-wide significance in combined analysis (Pjoint = 7.9 × 10(-9)). A cytokine involved in cellular metabolism, FGF21 is a potential susceptibility gene for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our results highlight the potential of genetic variation for determining dietary macronutrient intake.
23373677	Investigation of astatine(III) hydrolyzed species: experiments and relativistic calculations. This work aims to resolve some controversies about astatine(III) hydroxide species present in oxidant aqueous solution. AtO(+) is the dominant species existing under oxidizing and acidic pH conditions. This is consistent with high-performance ion-exchange chromatography data showing the existence of one species holding one positive charge. A change in speciation occurs as the pH changes from 1 to 4, while remaining under oxidizing conditions. Dynamic experiments with ion-exchange resins evidence the existence of a neutral species witnessed by its elution in the void volume. Batch-experiments using a competition method show the exchange of one proton indicating the formation of the AtO(OH) species. The hydrolysis thermodynamic constant, extrapolated to zero ionic strength, was determined to be 10(-1.9). This value is supported by two-component relativistic quantum calculations and therefore allows disclosing unambiguously the structure of the formed species.
23377542	Trim24-repressed VL30 retrotransposons regulate gene expression by producing noncoding RNA. Trim24 (Tif1α) and Trim33 (Tif1γ) interact to form a co-repressor complex that suppresses murine hepatocellular carcinoma. Here we show that Trim24 and Trim33 cooperatively repress retinoic acid receptor-dependent activity of VL30-class endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) in liver. In Trim24-knockout hepatocytes, VL30 derepression leads to accumulation of reverse-transcribed VL30 cDNA in the cytoplasm that correlates with activation of the viral-defense interferon responses mimicking the preneoplastic inflammatory state seen in human liver following exogenous viral infection. Furthermore, upon derepression, VL30 long terminal repeats (LTRs) act as promoter and enhancer elements deregulating expression of neighboring genes and generating enhancer RNAs that are required for LTR enhancer activity in hepatocytes in vivo. These data reinforce the role of the TRIM family of proteins in retroviral restriction and antiviral defense and provide an example of an ERV-derived oncogenic regulatory network.
23378608	GENENOTIN inhibits diet-induced obesity by enhancing lymphatic and blood vessel integrity. Angiogenesis is tightly associated with the outgrowth of adipose tissue, leading to obesity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes and hypertension, mainly because expanding adipose tissue requires an increased nutrient supply from blood vessels. Therefore, induction of vessel abnormality by GENENOTIN has been well studied, whereas how altered vascular function promotes obesity is relatively unexplored. Also, surviving GENENOTIN heterozygous mice showed abnormal lymphatic patterning and adult-onset obesity, indicating that accumulation of adipocytes could be closely linked with lymphatic function. Here we propose a new anti-obesity strategy based on enhancement of lymphatic and blood vessel integrity with GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN-knockout mice given a high-fat diet showed an obese phenotype associated with abnormal lymphatic and blood vessel enlargement. CHEMICALNOTIN present in the high-fat diet induced hyperpermeability of endothelial cells, causing adipocyte differentiation, whereas apelin promoted vascular stabilization. Moreover, treatment of high-fat-diet-fed GENENOTIN-knockout mice with a selective GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, improved vascular function, and also attenuated obesity. Finally, GENENOTIN transgenic mice showed decreased subcutaneous adipose tissue owing to inhibition of high-fat-diet-induced hyperpermeability of vessels. These results indicate that apelin inhibits high-fat-diet-induced obesity by enhancing vessel integrity. GENENOTIN could serve as a therapeutic target for treating obesity and related diseases.
23379481	Activation of the anti-cancer agent CHEMICALNOTIN by the GENENOTIN enzyme system. Abstract 1. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN®) is a new small molecule GENEIN inhibitor. The drug candidate was developed to inhibit the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) system, which plays a major role in tumor invasion and metastasis. CHEMICALNOTIN is currently in clinical development as an anti-metastatic and non-cytotoxic agent against pancreatic and breast cancer. 2. CHEMICALNOTIN is the orally available CHEMICALNOTIN- (i.e. CHEMICALNOTIN-) prodrug of the pharmacologically active form, CHEMICALNOTIN. In this study, the reductive enzymatic activation of CHEMICALNOTIN to its corresponding amidine CHEMICALNOTIN was analyzed. 3. The recently discovered CHEMICALNOTIN enzyme "GENENOTIN" (GENENOTIN) catalyses together with its GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN the reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN-hydroxylated prodrugs. In vitro biotransformation assays with porcine subcellular fractions and the reconstituted human enzymes demonstrate an GENENOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN-reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23381641	Differential autophagic cell death under stress with ectopic cytoplasmic and mitochondrial-specific PPP2R2B in human neuroblastoma cells. Protein phosphatase 2A is one of four major classes of serine/threonine phosphatases. Overexpression of brain-specific regulatory subunit PPP2R2 in neuron cells is implicated in pathogenesis. The alternative splicing of PPP2R2B encodes two isoforms. They are subunit of cytoplasmic specific Bβ1 and mitochondria-targeted Bβ2. The two constructs were transfected into human neuroblastoma cells, SK-N-SH, respectively, and the stable clones overexpressing either Bβ1 or Bβ2 established. We have reported that Bβ2 clones are sensitive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) treatment by inducing autophagic cell death. To study more on the onset of neuropathogenesis under strain, both clones were exposed to different environmental stress, e.g. starvation and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. To learn how PPP2R2B overexpression responds to starvation, cells were incubated in Hank's buffered salt solution of deprived nutrient. Cell death was induced in Bβ1 clones after 6 h starvation, but not in Bβ2 clones. The pharmacological inhibitor, Bafilomycin A1, rescued the cell death while suppressing autophagy. On the other hand, to assess how cells respond to ER stress, the cells were treated with 0.1 μM of N-glycosylation inhibitor, tunicamycin (TM). In contrast with Bβ1, the apoptotic cell death appeared in Bβ2 after 48 h treatment. The formation of autophagolysosome was detected in Bβ2 following 12 h treatment with TM as evidenced by lysotracker and GFP-LC3 staining for fluorescence microscopy analysis. The autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine, salvaged the final apoptosis. The stable cell lines with ectopically transfected PPP2R2B genes encoding isoforms of brain-specific regulatory subunit exhibit distinct apoptosis under different stressors. The induced autophagic apoptotic cell death is related to mitochondrial membrane potential drop and ROS generation. Disturbance of autophagy alleviates the induced cell death. The results promised a good model for understanding the onset in pathogenesis under stress in neuron cells with aberrant PPP2R2B expression.
23381936	Population pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin and its active metabolites in children and adolescents with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia: selective use of informative prior distributions from adults. The population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of atorvastatin and its principal active metabolite, o-hydroxyatorvastatin, were described in 6-17 years old pediatric hypercholesterolemia patients with a 2-compartment model for both parent and metabolite. Informative prior distributions on selected parameters, based on adult data, were required to stabilize the model and were implemented using a Bayesian penalty term on the likelihood function in the nonlinear mixed effects model (NONMEM VI with PRIOR). Concentrations below the limit of quantitation were treated as censored data using a conditional likelihood function. Atorvastatin apparent oral clearance (CL/F) was described as a function of body weight using an allometric equation. Based on the final model, the typical CL/F estimates for a Tanner Stage 1 patient (35 kg weight) and Tanner Stage ≥2 (50 kg weight), would be 553 and 543 L/hour, respectively. When scaled allometrically, CL/F was similar to values reported for adults. Variability in atorvastatin PK was primarily affected by weight.
23382074	A high-confidence interaction map identifies GENENOTIN as a mediator of acetylation of GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN coactivator complex. Although many functions and targets have been attributed to the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, a comprehensive analysis of GENENOTIN binding proteins yielding a high-confidence interaction map has not been established. Using a comparative statistical analysis of binding partners, we have assembled a high-confidence GENENOTIN interactome. Employing this method, we identified the deubiquitinating enzyme GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a component of the deubiquitinating module (DUBm) of the GENENOTIN transcriptional coactivating complex, as a GENENOTIN-interacting partner. We found that this interaction is highly specific, requires the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN, and is disrupted by the inactivating GENENOTIN mutation within GENENOTIN. Moreover, we show that GENEIN is acetylated on multiple CHEMICALIN residues and that alteration of a single CHEMICALIN (K129) within the GENEIN is sufficient to alter interaction of the GENENOTIN with the core GENENOTIN complex. Furthermore, GENENOTIN-mediated recruitment of GENENOTIN activity promotes the deacetylation of individual GENENOTIN complex components. Our results indicate an important role of GENENOTIN-mediated deacetylation in regulating the formation of GENENOTIN subcomplexes within the larger GENENOTIN complex.
23384997	Characterization of GENEIN and GENEIN genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and their modulation by in vitro CHEMICALIN exposure. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an oligonutrient with both essential biological functions and recognized harmful effects. As the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN is integrated in several CHEMICALNOTIN-containing proteins (selenoproteins), many of which are fundamental for cell homeostasis. Nevertheless, selenium may exert toxic effects at levels marginally above those required, mainly through the generation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS). The CHEMICALNOTIN chemical speciation can strongly affect the bioavailability of this metal and its impact on metabolism, dictating the levels that can be beneficial or detrimental towards an organism. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is the largest and the most studied GENENOTIN family. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) are widely distributed throughout tissues, and play a pivotal role in regulating the oxidative status in the cell. In this study we have cloned GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). The constitutive mRNA expression of these GENENOTIN genes was examined in 18 trout tissues and their responsiveness to Se availability was analysed using a rainbow trout liver cell line (RTL). An inorganic (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) and organic (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) selenocompound have been used as CHEMICALNOTIN sources. GENENOTIN activity was also tested to verify the impact of transcript changes on the enzymatic function of these molecules. To understand if the results obtained from the transcript expression analysis were due to CHEMICALNOTIN bioavailability or generation of ROS, the cytoxicity of the two selenocompounds was tested by measuring the impact of CHEMICALNOTIN on cell membrane integrity. Lastly, CHEMICALNOTIN availability was quantified by mass spectrophotometry to determine the amount of CHEMICALNOTIN in the cell culture media, the CHEMICALNOTIN background due to the foetal calf serum supplement and the contribution from the two selenocompounds used in the treatments. Three isoforms of genes for both GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) have been identified. The discovery of a third gene encoding for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN hints that salmonids may have the biggest selenoproteome amongst all vertebrates. Transcripts of GENENOTIN genes were more highly expressed in most tissues examined in vivo (except blood, head kidney and spleen), whereas those of the GENEIN genes were more responsive to CHEMICALIN exposure in vitro, especially to the organic form. Interestingly, GENEIN was the most sensitive to CHEMICALIN availability in non stressful conditions, whereas GENEIN and GENEIN were highly induced by exposure to CHEMICALIN levels that had some toxic effects on the cells. Although the different concentrations tested of the two selenocompounds modulate GENENOTIN transcript expression to various degrees, no significant change of GENENOTIN enzymatic activity was detectable. Our results lead us to conclude that trout GENEIN transcripts expression level may represent a sensitive biomarker for CHEMICALIN intake, helping to evaluate if CHEMICALNOTIN concentration and chemical speciation impact on cell homeostasis.
23385959	CHEMICALNOTIN-exposed developing rats display motor deficits and striatal oxidative stress that are reversed by CHEMICALNOTIN. While CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is essential for proper central nervous system (CNS) development, excessive CHEMICALNOTIN exposure may lead to neurotoxicity. CHEMICALNOTIN preferentially accumulates in the basal ganglia, and in adults it may cause Parkinson's disease-like disorder. Compared to adults, younger individuals accumulate greater CHEMICALNOTIN levels in the CNS and are more vulnerable to its toxicity. Moreover, the mechanisms mediating developmental CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxicity are not completely understood. The present study investigated the developmental neurotoxicity elicited by CHEMICALNOTIN exposure (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg; i.p.) from postnatal day 8 to PN27 in rats. Neurochemical analyses were carried out on PN29, with a particular focus on striatal alterations in intracellular signaling pathways (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), oxidative stress generation and cell death. Motor alterations were evaluated later in life at 3, 4 or 5 weeks of age. CHEMICALIN exposure (20 mg/kg) increased GENEIN(GENEIN) and GENEIN phosphorylation, but decreased GENEIN-Thr-34 phosphorylation. CHEMICALIN (10 and 20 mg/kg) increased GENEIN activity and CHEMICALNOTIN production (a biological marker of lipid peroxidation). Paralleling the changes in striatal biochemical parameters, CHEMICALNOTIN (20 mg/kg) also caused motor impairment, evidenced by increased falling latency in the rotarod test, decreased distance traveled and motor speed in the open-field test. Notably, the antioxidant CHEMICALIN™ reversed the CHEMICALIN (20 mg/kg)-dependent augmentation in GENEIN(GENEIN) phosphorylation and reduced the CHEMICALIN (20 mg/kg)-induced GENEIN activity and CHEMICALNOTIN production. CHEMICALNOTIN™ also reversed the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced motor coordination deficits. These findings are the first to show that long-term exposure to CHEMICALIN during a critical period of neurodevelopment causes motor coordination dysfunction with parallel increment in oxidative stress markers, GENEIN(GENEIN) phosphorylation and GENEIN activity in the striatum. Moreover, we establish CHEMICALNOTIN™ as a potential neuroprotective agent given its efficacy in reversing the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurodevelopmental effects.
23386029	CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN from the Marine Actinomycete Nocardiopsis sp. KMF-001. Three new CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (1-3), were isolated from the marine actinomycete Nocardiopsis sp. KMF-001. Their structures were assigned to be CHEMICALNOTIN on the basis of UV, MS, NMR, and high resolution (HR)-FAB-MS analyses. CHEMICALIN (1) reduced the pro-inflammatory factor such as CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN showed 5.82% stronger inhibitory effect on CHEMICALNOTIN production than chrysin at a concentration of 10 µm in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells.
23386703	Investigating the enteroenteric recirculation of CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor: administration of activated charcoal to bile duct-cannulated rats and dogs receiving an intravenous dose and use of drug transporter knockout rats. The study described here investigated the impact of intestinal excretion (IE; excretion of drug directly from circulation to intestinal lumen), enteroenteric recirculation (EER), and renal tubule recirculation (RTR) on CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacokinetics and disposition. The experimental approaches involve integrating CHEMICALNOTIN elimination pathways with pharmacokinetic profiles obtained from bile duct-cannulated (BDC) rats and dogs receiving i.v. doses together with oral administration of activated CHEMICALNOTIN (AC). Additionally, the role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN; GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN; GENENOTIN) in CHEMICALNOTIN disposition was evaluated in experiments using transporter inhibitors and transporter knockout (KO) rats. Approximately 20-50% of an CHEMICALNOTIN i.v. dose was found in feces of BDC rats and dogs, suggesting IE leading to fecal elimination and intestinal clearance (IC). The fecal elimination, IC, and systemic clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN were increased upon AC administration in both BDC rats and dogs and were decreased in BDC rats dosed with CHEMICALIN, a dual GENEIN and GENEIN inhibitor). GENEIN appeared to play a more important role for absorption and intestinal and renal elimination of CHEMICALIN than GENEIN in transporter-KO rats after oral and i.v. dosing, which led to a higher level of active renal excretion in rat than other species. These data demonstrate that CHEMICALNOTIN undergoes IE, EER, and RTR that are facilitated by efflux transporters. Intestinal reabsorption of CHEMICALNOTIN could be interrupted by AC even at 3 hours post-drug dose in dogs (late CHEMICALNOTIN effect). This study demonstrates that the intestine is an organ for direct clearance and redistribution of CHEMICALNOTIN. The IE, EER, and RTR contribute to overall pharmacokinetic profiles of CHEMICALNOTIN. IE as a clearance pathway, balanced with metabolism and renal excretion, helps decrease the impacts of intrinsic (renal or hepatic impairment) and extrinsic (drug-drug interactions) factors on CHEMICALNOTIN disposition.
23391336	Cloning, Characterization, and CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN Inhibition Studies of an GENEIN from Trypanosoma cruzi, the Causative Agent of Chagas Disease. An GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) has been identified, cloned, and characterized from the unicellular protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. The enzyme (GENEIN) has a very high catalytic activity for the CHEMICALIN hydration reaction, being similar kinetically to the human (h) isoform GENEIN, although it is devoid of the CHEMICALIN64 proton shuttle. A large number of CHEMICALIN and some CHEMICALIN were investigated as GENEIN inhibitors. The CHEMICALNOTIN were weak inhibitors (K(I) values of 192 nM to 84 μM), whereas some heterocyclic compounds inhibited the enzyme with K(I) values in the range 61.6-93.6 nM. The CHEMICALNOTIN were the most potent in vitro inhibitors (K(I) values of 21.1-79.0 nM), and some of them also inhibited the epimastigotes growth of two T. cruzi strains in vivo.
23391632	The increased number of Leydig cells by CHEMICALNOTIN comes from the differentiation of stem cells into Leydig cell lineage in the adult rat testis. The objective of the present study is to determine whether CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) exposure at adulthood increases rat Leydig cell number and to investigate the possible mechanism. 90-day-old Long-Evans rats were randomly divided into 3 groups, and were gavaged with the corn oil (control) or 10 or 750mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN daily for 7 days, and then received an intraperitoneal injection of 75mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) to eliminate Leydig cells. Serum CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations were assessed by RIA, and the mRNA levels of Leydig cell genes were measured by qPCR. CHEMICALNOTIN eliminated all Leydig cells in the control testis on day 4 post-CHEMICALNOTIN, as judged by undetectable serum CHEMICALNOTIN level and no GENENOTIN positive (GENENOTIN(pos)) cells in the interstitium. However, in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated groups, there were detectable serum CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations and some oval-shaped GENENOTIN(pos) cells in the interstitium. These GENENOTIN(pos) cells were not stained by the antibody against GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN1), a marker for Leydig cells at a more advanced stage. The disappearance of mRNAs of Leydig cell biomarkers including Lhcgr, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, Insl3 and Hsd11b1 in the control testis was observed on day 4 post-CHEMICALNOTIN. However, there were detectable concentrations of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN mRNAs but undetectable concentrations of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in the CHEMICALIN-treated testes, indicating that these GENENOTIN(pos) cells were newly formed progenitor Leydig cells. The mRNA level for GENEIN (GENEIN, biomarker for stem Leydig cells) was significantly increased in the control testis on day 4 post-CHEMICALIN, but not in the CHEMICALIN treated testes, suggesting that these GENENOTIN positive stem cells were differentiated into progenitor Leydig cells in the CHEMICALNOTIN-treated testes. The present study suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN increases the differentiation of stem cells into progenitor Leydig cells.
23393127	CHEMICALIN pulse frequency-dependent stimulation of GENEIN transcription is mediated via activation of GENEIN and GENEIN. Expression of pituitary GENEIN and GENEIN, under the control of pulsatile CHEMICALIN, is essential for fertility. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has been implicated in the regulation of GENENOTIN gene expression, but the molecular mechanisms by which pulsatile CHEMICALIN regulates GENEIN activation remain poorly understood. We hypothesized that GENEIN is activated by a distinct signaling pathway in response to pulsatile CHEMICALIN in a frequency-dependent manner to dictate the GENEIN transcriptional response. CHEMICALIN stimulation of GENEIN phosphorylation (GENEIN) in the gonadotrope-derived LβT2 cell line was attenuated by a GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. A GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) reduced CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN and markedly decreased CHEMICALIN stimulation of GENEIN mRNA and GENEINLUC activity, but had little effect on GENEINLUC activity, indicating relative specificity of this pathway. In perifusion studies, GENEIN mRNA levels and GENEINLUC activities were increased by pulsatile CHEMICALIN, with significantly greater increases at low compared with high pulse frequencies. GENENOTIN markedly reduced these CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN responses at both low and high pulse frequencies. Correlating with GENEIN activation, both GENEIN activity and levels of GENEIN were increased to a greater extent by low compared with high CHEMICALIN pulse frequencies, and the induction of GENEIN was also attenuated by overexpression of GENENOTIN at both low and high pulse frequencies. Taken together, these data indicate that a GENENOTIN-mediated signaling pathway mediates CHEMICALIN activation of GENEIN at low-pulse frequencies, playing a significant role in the decoding of the hypothalamic CHEMICALIN signal to result in frequency-dependent GENEIN activation.
23395669	CHEMICALIN alleviates hepatocyte steatosis through activating GENEIN signaling pathway. CHEMICALIN, an effective compound derived from foxtail-like sophora herb and seed, has been reported that it can alleviate non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) in rats and affect GENEIN synthesis. Meanwhile, GENENOTIN could adjust hepatic lipid metabolism through GENENOTIN signaling pathway. In the work presented here, primary hepatocytes were isolated from specific pathogen-free male SD rats and incubated with 200 μmol/L CHEMICALNOTIN for 24h to induce steatotic model, then treated with CHEMICALNOTIN for 72 h. Oil red staining was performed to evaluate steatosis, total RNA and protein of primary hepatocytes were extracted for real-time RT-PCR and western blot analysis. A cluster of aberrances were observed in the model group, including hepatocyte steatosis, increased GENENOTIN and decreased GENENOTIN mRNA expressions. While CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in: significant improvement of steatosis (>50% decrease), decrease of GENEIN expression (<0.57-fold) and increase of GENEIN expression (>1.48-fold). Moreover, compared with the model group, CHEMICALIN could significantly increase GENEIN (>5.82-fold), GENEIN (>1.29-fold) and GENEIN (>3.27-fold) protein expressions, and reduce GENEIN (<0.30-fold) and GENEIN (<0.20-fold) protein expression. The mRNA expression of GENENOTIN was downregulated significantly simultaneously (<0.68-fold). We concluded that CHEMICALIN could alleviate hepatocyte steatosis and the potential mechanism might be the activated signaling pathway of GENEIN.
23395825	Elevation of 4-hydroxynonenal and malondialdehyde modified protein levels in cerebral cortex with cognitive dysfunction in rats exposed to 1-bromopropane. 1-Bromopropane (1-BP), an alternative to ozone-depleting solvents (ODS), exhibits central nervous system (CNS) toxicity in animals and humans. This study was designed to relate CNS damage by Morris water maze (MWM) test and oxidative stress to 1-BP exposure in the rat. Male Wistar rats were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10), and treated with 0, 200, 400 and 800mg/kgbw 1-BP for consecutive 12 days, respectively. From day 8 to day 12 of the experiment, MWM test was employed to assess the cognitive function of rats. The cerebral cortex of rats was obtained immediately following the 24h after MWM test conclusion. Glutathione (GSH), oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and total thiol (total-SH) content, GSH reductase (GR) and GSH peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities, malondialdehyde (MDA) level, as well as 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) and MDA modified proteins in homogenates of cerebral cortex were measured. The obtained results showed that 1-BP led to cognitive dysfunction of rats, which was evidenced by delayed escape latency time and swimming distances in MWM performance. GSH and total-SH content, GSH/GSSG ratio, GR activity significantly decreased in cerebral cortex of rats, coupling with the increase of MDA level. 4-HNE and MDA modified protein levels obviously elevated after 1-BP exposure. GSH-Px activities in cerebral cortex of rats also increased. These data suggested that 1-BP resulted in enhanced lipid peroxidation of brain, which might play an important role in CNS damage induced by 1-BP.
23395914	Site dependent intestinal absorption of CHEMICALNOTIN and its interaction with CHEMICALNOTIN. The expression of GENENOTIN increases from proximal to distal parts of the small intestine, whereas for GENENOTIN the expression is reported to be highest in duodenum and jejunum, decreasing to more distal sites. To evaluate to what extent the regional differences in expression of GENEIN and GENEIN affect the absorption of a dual substrate, we investigated the transport of CHEMICALIN across different small intestinal segments (duodenum, proximal jejunum and ileum). Moreover, the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on the intestinal absorption of CHEMICALNOTIN was explored, since these drugs are commonly co-administered. Performing the rat in situ intestinal perfusion technique with mesenteric blood sampling, we found no significant differences in the transport of CHEMICALNOTIN at the different intestinal segments. The involvement of GENEIN in the absorption of CHEMICALIN was clearly shown by coperfusion of CHEMICALNOTIN with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. In presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, a 2.2-, 4.2- and 5.7-fold increase in Papp values were measured for duodenum, proximal jejunum and ileum, respectively. Involvement of GENEIN mediated metabolism in the absorption of CHEMICALIN could not be demonstrated in this rat model. Upon studying the drug-drug interaction of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN, data were indicative for an inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN as the main mechanism for the increased transport of CHEMICALIN across the small intestine.
23396144	Protective effect of Codium fragile against UVB-induced pro-inflammatory and oxidative damages in HaCaT cells and BALB/c mice. Acute exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation causes pro-inflammatory responses via diverse mechanisms including oxidative stress. Codium fragile is a green alga of Codiales family and has been reported to exhibit anti-edema, anti-allergic, anti-protozoal and anti-mycobacterial activities. In this study, we have investigated a novel anti-inflammatory potential of C. fragile using in vitro cell culture as well as in vivo animal models. In HaCaT cells, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN fractions of 80% CHEMICALIN C. fragile extract (CFB or CFE) and a single compound, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) isolated from CFE attenuated UVB (60mJ/cm(2))-induced cytotoxicity and reduced expression of pro-inflammatory proteins including GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), and GENEIN (GENEIN). Moreover, CFB, CFE and CHEMICALNOTIN effectively suppressed UVB-induced production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). In another experiment, topical application of CFB, CFE or CHEMICALIN prior to UVB irradiation (200mJ/cm(2)) on BALB/c mice, inhibited the UVB-elevated protein levels of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. Furthermore, CFB, CFE and CHEMICALNOTIN suppressed oxidative damages caused by UVB irradiation for example lipid peroxidation and/or protein carbonylation, which seemed to be mediated by up-regulation of antioxidant defense enzymes. These results suggest that C. fragile could be an effective therapeutic agent providing protection against UVB-induced inflammatory and oxidative skin damages.
23398572	Strong effects of cluster size and air exposure on oxygen reduction and carbon oxidation electrocatalysis by size-selected Pt(n) (n ≤ 11) on glassy carbon electrodes. Model Pt(n)/glassy carbon electrodes (Pt(n)/GCE) were prepared by deposition of mass-selected Pt(n)(+) (n ≤ 11) on GCE substrates in ultrahigh vacuum. Electrocatalysis under conditions appropriate for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) was studied, for samples both in situ with no exposure to laboratory air and with air exposure prior to electrochemical measurements. Of the small clusters, only a few cluster sizes show the expected ORR activity, and in those cases, the activity per Pt atom is similar to that seen under identical conditions with a conventionally prepared electrode with Pt nanoparticles grown on a GCE. For other small Pt(n) on GCE, any ORR signal is overwhelmed by large oxidative currents attributed to catalysis of carbon oxidation by water. If the samples are exposed to air prior to electrochemistry, both ORR and carbon oxidation signals are absent, and instead only small capacitive currents or currents attributed to redox chemistry of adventitious organic adsorbates are observed, indicating that air exposure results in passivation of the small Pt clusters.
23399323	Inhibition of ghrelin O-acyltransferase attenuates food deprivation-induced increases in ingestive behavior. Ghrelin is an orexigenic hormone produced by the stomach in direct proportion to the time since the last meal and has therefore been called a 'hunger signal'. The octanoylation of ghrelin is critical for its orexigenic functions and is dependent upon ghrelin O-acyltransferase (GOAT) catalyzation. The GOAT inhibitor, GO-CoA-Tat, decreases the circulating concentrations of octanoylated ghrelin and attenuates weight gain on a high fat diet in mice. Unlike rats and mice, Siberian hamsters and humans do not increase food intake after food deprivation, but increase food hoarding after food deprivation. In Siberian hamsters, exogenous ghrelin increases ingestive behaviors similarly to 48-56h food deprivation. Therefore, we tested the necessity of increased ghrelin in food-deprived Siberian hamsters to stimulate ingestive behaviors. To do so we used our simulated natural housing system that allows hamsters to forage for and hoard food. Animals were given an injection of GO-CoA-Tat (i.p., 11μmol/kg) every 6h because that is the duration of its effective inhibition of octanoylated ghrelin concentrations during a 48h food deprivation. We found that GO-CoA-Tat attenuated food foraging (0-1h), food intake (0-1 and 2-4h), and food hoarding (0-1h and 2 and 3days) post-refeeding compared with saline treated animals. This suggests that increased octanoylated ghrelin concentrations play a role in the food deprivation-induced increases in ingestive behavior. Therefore, ghrelin is a critical aspect of the multi-faceted mechanisms that stimulate ingestive behaviors, and might be a critical point for a successful clinical intervention scheme in humans.
23400796	The accumulation of metal (Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn) in freshwater Ulva (Chlorophyta) and its habitat. The possibility of using freshwater Ulva (Chlorophyta) as a bioaccumulator of metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Mn and Zn) in lake and river water was examined weekly in the summer of 2010 in three types of samples: the water, the sediment and the thalli of Ulva. Samples of freshwater Ulva were collected from two aqueous ecosystems lie 250 km away from the basin of the Baltic Sea and 53 km from each other. A flow lake located in the centre of the big city was the first water reservoir (ten sites) and second, the suburban river (six sites). The mean metal concentrations in the Ulva tissue from the river and the lake decreased in the following order: Mn > Zn > Cr > Cu > Co and Mn > Cr > Zn > Cu > Co, respectively. Moreover, a negative and statistically significant correlation between Mn concentrations in the Ulva thalli and the river water was observed. Additionally, numerous correlations were noted between the different concentrations of metals within the Ulva thalli, in the water and in the sediment. The great concentrations of Mn and Zn and the smallest of Co were found in thalli of Ulva, irrespective of the type of the ecosystem from which samples of algal thalli originated. Freshwater Ulva populations examined in this study were clearly characterized a dozen or so times by the higher Mn and Cr accumulation than taxa from that genera coming from sea ecosystems. The calculated bioconcentration factor confirm the high potential for freshwater Ulva to be a bioaccumulator of trace metals in freshwater ecosystems.
23401298	Exploring the Interplay Between Ligand Derivatisation and Cation Type in the Assembly of Hybrid Polyoxometalate Mn-Andersons. Herein a library of hybrid Mn-Anderson polyoxometalates anions are presented: 1, [(MnMo(6) O(18) )((OCH(2) )(3) -C-(CH(2) )(7) CHCH(2) )(2) ](3-) ; compound 2, [(MnMo(6) O(18) )((OCH(2) )(3) C-NHCH(2) C(16) H(9) )(2) ](3-) ; compound 3, [(MnMo(6) O(18) )((OCH(2) )(3) C-(CH(2) )(7) CHCH(2) )(1) ((OCH(2) )(3) C-NHCH(2) C(16) H(9) )(1) ](3-) ; compound 4, [(MnMo(6) O(18) )((OCH(2) )(3) C-NHC(O)CH(2) CHCH(2) )(2) ](3-) and compounds 5-9, [(MnMo(6) O(18) )((OCH(2) )(3) C-NHC(O)(CH(2) )(x) CH(3) )(2) ]), where x = 4, 10, 12, 14, and 18 respectively. The compounds resulting from the cation exchange of the anions 1-9 to give TBA (a) and DMDOA (b) salts, and additionally for compounds 1, 2 and 3, tetraphenylphosphonium (PPh(4) ) (c) salts, are explored at the air/water interface using scanning force microscopy, showing a range of architectures including hexagonal structures, nanofibers and other supramolecular forms. Additionally the solid-state structures for compounds 1c, 2c, 4a, 6a, 9a, are presented for the first time and these investigations demonstrate the delicate interplay between the structure of the covalently derivatised hybrid organo-clusters as well as the ion-exchange cation types.
23401473	Interaction of silymarin CHEMICALIN with GENEIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are GENENOTIN mediating the uptake of endogenous compounds and xenobiotics in tissues that are important for drug absorption and elimination, including the intestine and liver. Silymarin is a popular herbal supplement often used by patients with chronic liver disease; higher oral doses than those customarily used (140 mg three times/day) are being evaluated clinically. The present study examined the effect of silymarin CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN-, GENENOTIN-, and GENENOTIN-mediated transport in cell lines stably expressing these transporters and in human hepatocytes. In overexpressing cell lines, GENEIN- and GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake and GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake were inhibited by most of the silymarin CHEMICALIN investigated. GENEIN-, GENEIN-, and GENEIN-mediated substrate transport was inhibited efficiently by silymarin (IC50 values of 1.3, 2.2 and 0.3 µM, respectively), CHEMICALIN (IC50 values of 9.7, 2.7 and 4.5 µM, respectively), CHEMICALIN (IC50 values of 8.5, 5.0 and 0.8 µM, respectively), and CHEMICALIN (IC50 values of 9.0, 36.4, and 3.6 µM, respectively). Furthermore, silymarin, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN (100 µM) significantly inhibited GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN uptake into human hepatocytes. Calculation of the maximal unbound portal vein concentrations/IC50 values indicated a low risk for silymarin-drug interactions in hepatic uptake with a customary silymarin dose. The extent of silymarin-drug interactions depends on GENEIN isoform specificity and concentrations of CHEMICALIN at the site of drug transport. Higher than customary doses of silymarin, or formulations with improved bioavailability, may increase the risk of CHEMICALNOTIN interactions with GENENOTIN substrates in patients.
23402628	Oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN-derivatized surfaces to control protein adhesion. Selective oxidation of CHEMICALIN self-assembled CHEMICALIN monolayers to CHEMICALIN is shown to transform the adhesion of model proteins GENEIN and GENEIN upon them. Efficient preparation of both CHEMICALNOTIN as judged by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and water droplet contact angle was achieved with an improved CHEMICALNOTIN bond formation on gold CHEMICALNOTIN crystal microbalance (QCM) sensors using CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Oxidation with CHEMICALIN was similarly assessed, and adhesion of GENEIN and GENEIN from CHEMICALNOTIN buffered saline was then assayed by QCM and imaged by AFM. CHEMICALNOTIN-functionalized sensors adsorbed multilayers of aggregated GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN-terminated monolayers are consistent with small protein aggregates. The surface containing a CHEMICALNOTIN headgroup and CHEMICALNOTIN linker showed the largest difference in adsorption of both proteins. Oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN decorated surfaces therefore holds the potential for selective deposition of proteins and cells through masking and other patterning techniques.
23403014	Stabilisation of amorphous drugs under high humidity using pharmaceutical thin films. In this study, the stabilization effects of three polymers on four model drugs (felodipine, fenofibrate, carbamazepine, and celecoxib) under saturated humidity were investigated. Three different types of thin films (solid dispersions, drug films with a polymer film coating and drug films laid on top of polymer coated surfaces) were prepared and compared with films containing the drug alone. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy, polarised light microscopy (PLM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and nano-thermal analysis (nano-TA) were performed on the model systems after storage under saturated humidity. The recrystallisation tendency of the drug in the drug containing thin films was found to be strongly related to the intrinsic crystallization tendency of the drug film alone and the strength of drug-polymer interactions. Additionally, under high humidity, the glass transition temperature of the polymer is no longer an indicator of its drug stabilization capability. Instead, it is the hygroscobicity of the polymer that appears to be the most important parameter. Amongst the polymers tested in this study, EUDRAGIT E PO was found to have the greatest inhibitory effect on crystallization, whilst PVP K30 was found to have the least protective effect; presumably because of its hygroscopic nature.
23403085	Neuroprotective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN analogs on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. A series of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives were designed and synthesized. Their neuroprotective effects toward CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis were investigated in human SH-SY5Y cells. The results from these studies identified several potent compounds, with compound 8k emerging as the most effective. Further investigation demonstrated that 8k reduced CHEMICALIN-induced activation of mitochondrial apoptosis by inhibiting the expression of GENEIN and elevating the expression of GENEIN. Moreover, the molecular mechanism underlying the observed neuroprotective effects of 8k was exerted via the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN pathways. Compound 8k can be a lead compound for further discovery of neuroprotective medicine.
23404443	Effects of induced hyperinsulinaemia with and without hyperglycaemia on measures of cardiac vagal control. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: We examined the effects of GENENOTIN levels on vagal control over the heart and tested the hypothesis that higher fasting GENENOTIN levels are associated with lower vagal control. We also examined whether experimentally induced increases in GENENOTIN by beta cell secretagogues, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), will decrease vagal control. METHODS: Respiration and ECGs were recorded for 130 healthy participants undergoing clamps. Three variables of cardiac vagal effects (the root mean square of successive differences [rMSSD] in the interbeat interval of the heart rate [IBI], heart-rate variability [HRV] caused by peak-valley respiratory sinus arrhythmia [pvRSA], and high-frequency power [HF]) and heart rate (HR) were obtained at seven time points during the clamps, characterised by increasing levels of GENEIN (achieved by administering GENENOTIN plus CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN only, CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN, and CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN combined with CHEMICALIN). RESULTS: GENENOTIN level was positively associated with HR at all time points during the clamps except the first-phase hyperglycaemic clamp. GENEIN levels were negatively correlated with variables of vagal control, reaching significance for rMSSD and log(10)HF, but not for pvRSA, during the last four phases of the hyperglycaemic clamp (hyperglycaemic second phase, GENENOTIN first and second phases, and CHEMICALIN). These associations disappeared when adjusted for age, BMI and GENENOTIN sensitivity. Administration of the beta cell secretagogues GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN led to a significant increase in HR, but this was not paired with a significant reduction in HRV measures. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Experimentally induced hyperinsulinaemia is not correlated with cardiac vagal control or HR when adjusting for age, BMI and GENENOTIN sensitivity index. Our findings suggest that exposure to a GENENOTIN during hyperglycaemia leads to a small acute increase in HR but not to an acute decrease in cardiac vagal control.
23404505	The propeptides of GENENOTIN determine heparin binding, receptor heterodimerization, and effects on tumor biology. GENENOTIN is an angiogenic and lymphangiogenic glycoprotein that can be proteolytically processed generating various forms differing in subunit composition due to the presence or absence of CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal propeptides. These propeptides flank the central GENENOTIN, that contains the binding sites for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), but their biological functions were unclear. Characterization of propeptide function will be important to clarify which forms of GENENOTIN are biologically active and therefore clinically relevant. Here we use GENENOTIN mutants deficient in either propeptide, and in the capacity to process the remaining propeptide, to monitor the functions of these domains. We report for the first time that GENENOTIN binds heparin, and that the CHEMICALIN-terminal propeptide significantly enhances this interaction (removal of this propeptide from full-length GENEIN completely prevents heparin binding). We also show that removal of either the CHEMICALIN- or CHEMICALIN-terminal propeptide is required for GENEIN to drive formation of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN heterodimers which have recently been shown to positively regulate angiogenic sprouting. The mature form of GENENOTIN, lacking both propeptides, can also promote formation of these receptor heterodimers. In a mouse tumor model, removal of only the CHEMICALIN-terminal propeptide from full-length GENEIN was sufficient to enhance angiogenesis and tumor growth. In contrast, removal of both propeptides is required for high rates of lymph node metastasis. The findings reported here show that the propeptides profoundly influence molecular interactions of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN, co-receptors, and heparin, and its effects on tumor biology.
23406497	Switchable Elastin-Like Polypeptides that Respond to Chemical Inducers of Dimerization. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are protein polymers that reversibly phase separate in response to increased temperature, pressure, concentration, ionic strength, and molecular weight. If it were possible to engineer their phase separation to respond to specific molecular substrates, ELP fusion proteins might be engineered as biosensors, smart biomaterials, diagnostic imaging agents, and targeted therapies. What has been lacking is a strategy to design ELPs to respond to specific substrates. To address this deficiency, we report that ELP fusion proteins phase separate in response to chemical inducers of dimerization (CID). The rationale is that ELP phase separation depends on molecular weight, concentration, and local hydrophobicity; therefore, processes that affect these properties, including noncovalent dimerization, can be tuned to produce isothermal phase separation. To test this hypothesis, constructs were evaluated consisting of an immunophilin: human FK-506 binding protein 12 (FKBP) attached to an ELP. Under stoichiometric binding of a CID, the fusion protein homodimerizes and triggers phase separation. This dimerization is reversible upon saturation with excess CID or competitive binding of a small lipophilic macrolide to FKBP. By modulating the ELP molecular weight, phase separation was tuned for isothermal response to CID at physiological ionic strength and temperature (37 °C). To interpret the relationship between transition temperature and equilibrium binding constants, an empirical mathematical model was employed. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first demonstration of reversible ELP switching in response to controlled dimerization. Due to its simplicity, this strategy may be useful to design ELP fusion proteins that respond to specific dimeric biological entities.
23406956	Protective role of L-carnitine and vitamin E on the testis of atherosclerotic rats. Atherosclerosis is a condition caused by lipid build-up and inflammation in the arteries, so hyperlipidemia is the major reason for atherosclerosis. Testis was found to be negatively affected by hyperlipidemia which leads to its impaired functions. Vitamin E and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine have well-known lipid-lowering and antioxidative activities. Triton WR 1339 is a non-ionic detergent, which induces severe hyperlipidemia by inhibition of lipoprotein lipase. The present study evaluates the protective role of vitamin E and <sc>l</sc>-carnitine on the testis in atherosclerosis and detects the most effective choice for protection against atherosclerosis; vitamin E, <sc>l</sc>-carnitine or a combination of both. A total of 80 albino male rats were divided into eight groups (10 rats for each group): control (G(1)), triton (G(2)), <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (G(3)), triton + <sc>l</sc>-carnitine (G(4)), vitamin E (G(5)), triton + vitamin E (G(6)), <sc>l</sc>-carnitine + vitamin E (G(7)) and triton + <sc>l</sc>-carnitine + vitamin E (G(8)). Data showed a significant increase in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), 17 beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17 β HSD), testicular catalase and malondialdehyde (MDA) in G(2) when compared with G(1), whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), serum testosterone, testicular 17 ketosteroid reductase (17 KSR), total thiol and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) data showed a significant decrease in G(2) when compared with G(1). Treatment with <sc>l</sc>-carnitine or/and vitamin E helps in improving the adverse effect of triton; also the histological changes confirm this finding. So the present study recommends all people to include <sc>l</sc>-carnitine and vitamin E in their diet to be protected against atherosclerosis.
23407783	The GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN prevents stress-induced cognitive deficit associated with hippocampal dysfunction: Comparison with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. RATIONALE: The selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN has been previously shown to attenuate the long-term cognitive deficit produced by traumatic stress exposure. Memory disturbances described in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients are believed to be associated with changes in neuronal activity, in particular at the level of the hippocampus. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims at investigating whether the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg/kg/day for 2 weeks) on cognitive impairment induced by traumatic stress exposure are associated with changes in hippocampal excitability. Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were compared to those of the CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor, CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg/kg/day), and the partial GENEIN agonist, CHEMICALIN (10 mg/kg/day), two compounds which have demonstrated clinical efficacy against PTSD. METHODS: Mice received two unavoidable electric foot-shocks. Then, 1 or 16 days after stress, they were tested for their memory performance using the object recognition test. Neuronal excitability was recorded during the third week post-stress in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Drugs were administered from day 1 post-stress to the day preceding the electrophysiological study. RESULTS: Application of electric shocks produced cognitive impairment 16, but not 1 day after stress, an effect which was associated with a decrease in hippocampal neuronal excitability. Both stress-induced effects were prevented by repeated administration of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm that the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN is able to attenuate the behavioral effects of traumatic stress exposure and indicate that these effects are associated with a normalization of hippocampal neuronal excitability impaired by stress.
23409871	Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of CHEMICALIN as allosteric GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonists. A series of CHEMICALIN were synthesized and examined as GENEIN antagonists. CHEMICALNOTIN- or CHEMICALNOTIN-containing groups were the more potent CHEMICALNOTIN C4 substituents. Only small groups were tolerated at C5, C6, or C7, with the C6 analogues being preferred. The most potent N3-substituent was CHEMICALNOTIN. N1 meta-substituted CHEMICALNOTIN groups possessing an α-amino-CHEMICALNOTIN-group were the most potent N1-substituents. Strongly basic CHEMICALNOTIN groups had low oral absorption in vivo. Less basic analogues, such as CHEMICALNOTIN, had good oral absorption; however, they also had high clearance. The most potent compound with high absorption in two species was analogue 6 (CHEMICALNOTIN), which was selected for further development. CHEMICALIN antagonists bind to GENEIN at an intracellular allosteric site denoted site II. X-ray diffraction studies on two CHEMICALNOTIN fragments suggested the presence of an important intramolecular interaction in the active conformation.
23411185	Comparative analysis of nutritional compositions of transgenic high iron rice with its non-transgenic counterpart. Iron is an essential micronutrient for human nutrition and polished rice contains very low amount of iron. Rice with high iron content in seed endosperm has been developed by insertion of soybean ferritin gene under the control of the endosperm specific glutelin promoter into the genome of indica rice line IR68144. The nutritional composition of the brown and milled rice grain has been compared with that of the non-transgenic rice of the same variety. In this study, the nutritional components, as well as the anti-nutrient levels, were measured. Our studies established that apart from the increased level of iron and zinc in transgenic seeds, the nutritional quality of both the brown and milled rice grains from the transgenic line was substantially equivalent to that of the non-transgenic rice plants. The result clearly shows that the measured amounts of the nutritional components are well within the range of values reported for other commercial lines.
23412396	Repeated Low Dose Administration of the GENEIN Inhibitor CHEMICALIN Retains GENEIN Receptor Mediated Antinociceptive and Gastroprotective Effects. The GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN produces antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects. However, repeated administration of high dose CHEMICALNOTIN (40 mg/kg) causes dependence, antinociceptive tolerance, cross-tolerance to the pharmacological effects of GENENOTIN agonists, and GENENOTIN receptor downregulation and desensitization. This functional GENENOTIN receptor tolerance poses a hurdle in the development of GENENOTIN inhibitors for therapeutic use. Consequently, the present study tested whether repeated administration of low dose CHEMICALNOTIN maintains its antinociceptive actions in the chronic constrictive injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve neuropathic pain model and protective effects in a model of NSAlD-induced gastric hemorrhages. Mice given daily injections of high dose CHEMICALIN (≥16 mg/kg) for six days displayed decreased GENEIN receptor density and function in brain, as assessed in CHEMICALIN binding and CHEMICALIN-stimulated [CHEMICALIN]GTPγS binding assays, respectively. In contrast, normal GENEIN receptor expression and function were maintained following repeated administration of low dose CHEMICALIN (≤8 mg/kg). Likewise, the antinociceptive and gastroprotective effects of high dose CHEMICALNOTIN underwent tolerance following repeated administration, but these effects were maintained following repeated low dose CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Consistent with these observations, repeated high dose CHEMICALNOTIN, but not repeated low dose CHEMICALNOTIN, elicited cross-tolerance to the common pharmacological effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). This same pattern of effects was found in a CHEMICALNOTIN-precipitated withdrawal model of cannabinoid dependence. Taken together, these results indicate that prolonged, partial GENENOTIN inhibition maintains potentially beneficial antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effects, without producing functional GENENOTIN receptor tachyphylaxsis/tolerance or cannabinoid dependence.
23412922	Differential gene expression in ERα-positive and ERα-negative breast cancer cells upon leptin stimulation. In postmenopausal women, adipositas represents a serious risk factor for cancer development and progression. White adipose tissue secretes the 16 kDa hormone leptin which plays a key role in the regulation of appetite and metabolism. An increasing number of reports indicate that leptin also interferes with signal transduction pathways implicated in the development of breast cancer. In our previous study, we identified the estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) as a relevant enhancer of leptin-induced signal transduction leading to transactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3). The purpose of this study is the investigation of specific target gene expression in response to leptin-mediated Stat3 signaling. We performed a comprehensive microarray analysis of ERα-positive and ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells upon leptin treatment and identified 49 genes which showed a significant ERα-dependent regulation in leptin-treated MDA-MB-231 cells. There was no intersection with genes which were merely up- or downregulated by ERα expression and only 9 and 11 genes overlapping targets which were regulated by leptin stimulation either in ERα-expressing or ERα-negative MDA-MB-231 cells, respectively. To demonstrate the specificity, expression of three target genes was validated by quantitative real-time PCR. In conclusion, these data imply that leptin can induce a different set of target genes dependent on ERα expression, which might contribute to the development and progression of cancer diseases.
23416003	Design and synthesis of CHEMICALIN as potent GENEIN-GENEIN inhibitors. CHEMICALIN were designed and synthesized as potent GENEIN-GENEIN inhibitors. SAR demonstrated that the S2 and S3 pockets of GENENOTIN prefer to bind small, lipophilic groups. An X-ray crystal structure of optimized compound 9b bound in the active site of GENENOTIN showed that the bicyclic scaffold provides 5 CHEMICALNOTIN bonding interactions in addition to projecting groups for interactions within the S1, S2 and S3 pockets. Compound 9b showed excellent GENENOTIN potency, good selectivity against GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and good clotting activity.
23416007	A multivalent peptide as an activator of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a transcription factor found in mammalian cells under hypoxia. While GENENOTIN in hypoxia translocates to the nucleus where it transcribes the target genes including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mRNA, GENEIN is degraded under normoxia, which involves its CHEMICALIN hydroxylation and subsequent binding to the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) complex. Previously, peptide inhibitors against this interaction between hydroxylated GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN have been developed to stabilize the transcriptional activity of GENENOTIN by preventing the degradation of the protein even under normoxia. Despite the specific inhibition by these peptides, their poor inhibition potency needs to be improved for further clinical application. In this work, we have designed and prepared a streptavidin-based multivalent peptide inhibitor against the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN complexation. We have evaluated the potency of the multivalent peptide in terms of stabilization of GENENOTIN and the downstream effect. As the result, we have found that the inhibitor showed about 13-fold lowered IC50 value compared with that of the corresponding monovalent peptide, thereby activating GENENOTIN and leading to up-regulation of GENENOTIN protein at the cellular level.
23416070	Glucagon-induced acetylation of Foxa2 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism. Circulating levels of insulin and glucagon reflect the nutritional state of animals and elicit regulatory responses in the liver that maintain glucose and lipid homeostasis. The transcription factor Foxa2 activates lipid metabolism and ketogenesis during fasting and is inhibited via insulin-PI3K-Akt signaling-mediated phosphorylation at Thr156 and nuclear exclusion. Here we show that, in addition, Foxa2 is acetylated at the conserved residue Lys259 following inhibition of histone deacetylases (HDACs) class I-III and the cofactors p300 and SirT1 are involved in Foxa2 acetylation and deacetylation, respectively. Physiologically, fasting states and glucagon stimulation are sufficient to induce Foxa2 acetylation. Introduction of the acetylation-mimicking (K259Q) or -deficient (K259R) mutations promotes or inhibits Foxa2 activity, respectively, and adenoviral expression of Foxa2-K259Q augments expression of genes involved in fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis. Our study reveals a molecular mechanism by which glucagon signaling activates a fasting response through acetylation of Foxa2.
23416131	Antitumor and immunomodulatory activity of a water-soluble low molecular weight polysaccharide from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. A water-soluble low molecular weight polysaccharide (SCPP11) was extracted and purified using DEAE-cellulose and Sephadex G-100 column from Schisandra chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. Its in vivo and in vitro antitumor and immunomodulatory activity were investigated. The results showed that SCPP11 with a molecular weight of 3.4×10(3)Da exhibited indirect cyctotoxic activity against tumor cells in vitro, but could significantly inhibit the growth of Heps cells in vivo at dose of 50mg/kg, and its inhibition rate is higher than that in the positive group. Moreover, SCPP11 could ameliorate the hematological and biochemical parameters to almost normal and no significant changes in organ weight, and could increase the body weight. In addition, SCPP11 (at 50mg/kg) could also increased in thymus indexes as well as IL-2 and TNF-α levels in serum in vivo and significantly enhance the phagocytosis activity and the productions of NO of RAW264.7 in vitro. The results indicated that antitumor properties of SCPP11 might be achieved by improving immune response. It could be explored as a potential adjuvant against cancer used in the health food and pharmaceutical therapy.
23416191	Fragment-based drug design and identification of CHEMICALIN, a novel orally bioavailable GENEIN inhibitor for cancer therapy. Fragment-based drug design (FBDD) is a promising approach for the generation of lead molecules with enhanced activity and especially drug-like properties against therapeutic targets. Herein, we report the fragment-based drug design, systematic chemical synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of novel scaffolds as potent anticancer agents by utilizing six privileged fragments from known GENENOTIN inhibitors. Several new molecules such as compounds 5, 12, and 19 that may act as advanced chemical leads have been identified. The most potent compound 5 (CHEMICALIN) has demonstrated to inhibit GENEIN activity, downregulate phosphorylation of GENEIN, increase the expression of cleaved GENEIN, inhibit cell cycle progression and promote apoptosis in breast and pancreatic cancer cells with low micromolar to nanomolar IC50 values. Furthermore, compound 5 significantly suppressed GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-negative breast cancer MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor growth in vivo (p.o.), indicating its great potential as an efficacious and orally bioavailable drug candidate for human cancer therapy.
23416946	Transcription forms and remodels GENENOTIN unfolding large-scale chromatin structures. DNA supercoiling is an inherent consequence of twisting DNA and is critical for regulating gene expression and DNA replication. However, DNA supercoiling at a genomic scale in human cells is uncharacterized. To map supercoiling, we used CHEMICALIN as a DNA structure probe to show that the human genome is organized into GENEIN. Domains are formed and remodeled by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities and are flanked by GC-AT boundaries and GENENOTIN insulator protein-binding sites. GENENOTIN are transcriptionally active and enriched in GENENOTIN, 'open' chromatin fibers and GENENOTIN sites, but they are depleted of GENENOTIN. Furthermore, DNA supercoiling affects additional levels of chromatin compaction as GENENOTIN are cytologically decondensed, topologically constrained and decompacted by transcription of short RNAs. We suggest that supercoiling domains create a topological environment that facilitates gene activation, providing an evolutionary purpose for clustering genes along chromosomes.
23421877	Four new eudesmane-type sesquiterpenoid lactones from atractylenolide II by biotransformation of rat hepatic microsomes. The biotransformation of atractylenolide II, a major bioactive principle of the rhizomes of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz., was investigated in vitro by incubation with rat hepatic microsomes pretreated with sodium phenobarbital. The biotransformation products were extracted and purified by chromatographic methods. Seven biotransformation products (BP1-BP7) were obtained and their structures were elucidated by NMR and MS data analyses and by comparison with the previously reported values, including four new compounds, namely 4(R),15-epoxy-atractylenolide II (BP1), 4(R),15-epoxy-13-hydroxyatractylenolide II (BP5), 4(R),15-epoxy-1β-hydroxyatractylenolide II (BP6), and 4(R),15-dihydroxyatractylenolide II (BP7). The biotransformation pathway of atractylenolide II by hepatic microsomes was deducted based on the structure resolution of the products.
23427190	The effects of the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN on cognitive performance in healthy adults: a behavioral- electroencephalography study. GENENOTIN inhibitors (GENENOTIN-Is) improve cognitive performance of rodents, but the few human studies investigating their effects did not systematically investigate cognitive effects and the results have been quite contradictory. Therefore, we examined whether the GENEIN-I CHEMICALIN improves memory and executive functioning and affect electroencephalography (EEG) in healthy young adults. Participants were selected out of a group of volunteers, based on their performance on a memory screening and they were orally treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (10-20 mg or placebo). Memory and executive functioning were tested while EEG activity was recorded. Additionally, a simple reaction time task and questionnaires addressing various complaints were presented. No prominent effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on cognition were found: participants only made more mistakes on a reaction time task after 20 mg CHEMICALNOTIN. During encoding of words, the P300 was generally smaller after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Furthermore, the N400 was larger after CHEMICALNOTIN 10 mg than placebo treatment in a spatial memory task at Fz. Finally, headache and feeling weak were reported more after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. CHEMICALNOTIN did not affect cognitive performance of healthy adults and showed only some incidental effects on ERPs. These findings in humans do not corroborate the cognition-enhancing effects of GENENOTIN-Is in healthy animals.
23428346	CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal elicits oxidative/nitrosative damage in the rat cerebral cortex. Statins are inhibitors of the enzyme GENEIN, the rate-limiting step in CHEMICALIN biosynthesis. Statins effectively prevent and reduce the risk of coronary artery disease through lowering serum CHEMICALNOTIN, and also exert anti-thrombotic, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects independently of changes in CHEMICALNOTIN levels. On the other hand, clinical and experimental evidence suggests that abrupt cessation of statin treatment (i.e. statin withdrawal) is associated with a deleterious rebound phenomenon. In fact, statin withdrawal increases the risk of thrombotic vascular events, causes impairment of endothelium-dependent relaxation and facilitates experimental seizures. However, evidence for statin withdrawal-induced detrimental effects to the brain parenchyma is still lacking. In the present study adult male Wistar rats were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN for seven days (10mg/kg/day) and neurochemical assays were performed in the cerebral cortex 30min (CHEMICALNOTIN treatment) or 24h (CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal) after the last CHEMICALNOTIN administration. We found that CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal decreased levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN activity, whereas increased GENEIN activity and immunoreactivity for the protein nitration marker CHEMICALIN in the cerebral cortex. GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN activities were not altered by CHEMICALIN treatment or withdrawal, as well as protein CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN immunoreactivity. Immunoprecipitation of GENENOTIN followed by analysis of CHEMICALNOTIN revealed increased levels of nitrated GENENOTIN, suggesting the mechanism underlying the CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal-induced decrease in enzyme activity. Altogether, our results indicate the CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal elicits oxidative/nitrosative damage in the rat cerebral cortex, and that changes in GENENOTIN activity and GENENOTIN activities may underlie such harmful effects.
23428368	Hyperthyroidism causes cardiac dysfunction by mitochondrial impairment and energy depletion. This study elucidates the role of metabolic remodeling in cardiac dysfunction induced by hyperthyroidism. Cardiac hypertrophy, structural remodeling, and expression of the genes associated with CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism were examined in rats treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (T3) alone (8 μg/100 g body weight (BW), i.p.) for 15 days or along with a GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; 30 μg/100 g BW, oral) and were found to improve in the CHEMICALNOTIN co-treated condition. Ultrastructure of mitochondria was damaged in T3-treated rat heart, which was prevented by CHEMICALNOTIN co-administration. Hyperthyroidism-induced oxidative stress, reduction in GENEIN activity, and myocardial CHEMICALNOTIN concentration were also significantly checked by CHEMICALIN. Heart function studied at different time points during the course of T3 treatment shows an initial improvement and then a gradual but progressive decline with time, which is prevented by CHEMICALNOTIN co-treatment. In summary, the results demonstrate that hyperthyroidism inflicts structural and functional damage to mitochondria, leading to energy depletion and cardiac dysfunction.
23429231	Endothelial cell response to (co)polymer nanoparticles depending on the inflammatory environment and comonomer ratio. Endothelial cells lining the lumen of blood vessels serve as a physiological barrier controlling nanoparticle movement from the vasculature into the tissue. For exploring the effect of polymer hydrophilicity on nanoparticle interactions with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, a series of monomodal poly[acrylonitrile-co-(N-vinylpyrrolidone)] model nanoparticles with increasing hydrophilicity as related to their increasing content (0-30mol.%) of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) were synthesized by miniemulsion polymerization. Nanoparticles with a low NVP content were rapidly endocytized into all cells independent from the particle dose with toxic effects only observed at high particle concentrations, while only 10-30% of the cells incorporated particles with ⩾20mol.% NVP. Since pathologies are often related to inflammation, an inflammatory HUVEC culture condition with IL-1β stimulation has been introduced and suggested to be widely applied for studying nanocarriers, since cellular uptake in this assay was clearly increased for NVP contents ⩾20mol.%. Importantly, the secretion of functional biological mediators by HUVEC was not relevantly influenced by the nanoparticles for both homeostatic and inflammatory conditions. These findings may motivate concepts for nanocarriers specifically targeted to pathologic regions. Additionally, rapidly endocytized RhodaminB loaded particles with low NVP content may be explored for cell labeling and tracking.
23429911	Molecular mechanism regulating 24-hour rhythm of GENENOTIN expression in mouse ventral striatum. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in the ventral striatum is thought to influence motivation and motor functions. Although the expression of GENENOTIN in the ventral striatum has been shown to exhibit 24-hour variations, the mechanisms underlying the variation remain obscure. Here, we demonstrated that molecular components of the circadian clock act as regulators that control the 24-hour variation in the expression of GENENOTIN. The transcription of GENENOTIN was enhanced by the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and its activation was inhibited by the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, an endogenous antagonist of GENENOTIN. The serum or CHEMICALIN-induced oscillation in the expression of GENEIN in cells was abrogated by the downregulation or overexpression of GENEIN, suggesting that GENENOTIN functions as a regulator of GENENOTIN oscillations in the cellular autonomous clock. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays of the GENENOTIN indicated that the binding of the GENENOTIN protein to the GENENOTIN increased in the early dark phase. GENENOTIN protein expression varied with higher levels during the dark phase. Moreover, the effects of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-induced locomotor hypoactivity were significantly increased when GENEIN proteins were abundant. These results suggest that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN consist of a reciprocating mechanism wherein GENENOTIN upregulates the expression of GENENOTIN, whereas GENENOTIN periodically suppresses the expression at the time of day when GENENOTIN is abundant. Our present findings revealed that a molecular link between the circadian clock and the function of GENENOTIN in the ventral striatum acts as a modulator of the pharmacological actions of GENENOTIN agonists/antagonists.
23432124	Studies on an CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN: asymmetric synthesis, neuroactivity, and structural characterization. CHEMICALIN was developed and identified as a member of a new class of heterotricyclic CHEMICALIN analogues that act as GENEIN-selective antagonists. However, it was not known which enantiomer of CHEMICALNOTIN was responsible for its pharmacological activities. Here, we report in vivo and in vitro neuronal activities of both enantiomers of CHEMICALNOTIN prepared by enantioselective asymmetric synthesis. By employment of CHEMICALNOTIN as a chiral auxiliary, CHEMICALNOTIN and the (2S)-counterpart were successfully synthesized in 0.70% and 1.5% yields, respectively, over a total of 18 steps. Both behavioral and electrophysiological assays showed that the biological activity observed for the racemic mixture was reproduced only with CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas the (2S)-counterpart was inactive in both assays. CHEMICALIN was crystallized with the ligand-binding domain of GENEIN, and the structure revealed a complex containing CHEMICALIN at the glutamate binding site. CHEMICALIN locks the GENEIN in an open form, consistent with a pharmacological action as competitive antagonist of GENEIN.
23432429	Binding of Diverse Environmental Chemicals with GENENOTIN and Enzyme Inhibition. A total of 68 chemicals including derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN were examined for their abilities to interact with GENENOTIN. Fifty-one of these 68 chemicals induced stronger Type I binding spectra (CHEMICALNOTIN low- to high-spin state shift) with GENENOTIN than those seen with GENENOTIN, i.e., the spectral binding intensities (ΔAmax/Ks ratio) determined with these chemicals were always higher for GENENOTIN. In addition, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN were found to induce a Type I spectral change only with GENEIN. CHEMICALIN 7-hydroxylation, catalyzed by GENEIN, was strongly inhibited by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN; these chemicals induced Type I spectral changes with low Ks values. On the basis of the intensities of the spectral changes and inhibition of GENENOTIN, we classified the 68 chemicals into eight groups based on the order of affinities for these chemicals and inhibition of GENENOTIN. The metabolism of chemicals by GENENOTIN during the assays explained why some of the chemicals that bound well were poor inhibitors of GENENOTIN. Finally, we compared the 68 chemicals for their abilities to induce Type I spectral changes of GENENOTIN with the Reverse Type I binding spectra observed with GENENOTIN: 45 chemicals interacted with both GENENOTIN, indicating that the two enzymes have some similarty of structural features regarding these chemicals. Molecular docking analyses suggest similarities at the active sites of these GENENOTIN. These results indicate that GENENOTIN, as well as Family 1 GENENOTIN, is able to catalyze many detoxication and activation reactions with chemicals of environmental interest.
23432662	Discovery of a Novel Selective GENENOTIN Ligand with Partial Agonist Binding Properties by Integrated in Silico/in Vitro Work Flow. Full agonists to the GENEIN, such as CHEMICALIN, have been associated with a series of undesired side effects, such as weight gain, fluid retention, cardiac hypertrophy, and hepatotoxicity. Nevertheless, GENENOTIN is involved in the expression of genes that control CHEMICALNOTIN and lipid metabolism and is an important target for drugs against type 2 diabetes, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, and cardiovascular disease. In an effort to identify novel GENENOTIN ligands with an improved pharmacological profile, emphasis has shifted to selective ligands with partial agonist binding properties. Toward this end we applied an integrated in silico/in vitro workflow, based on pharmacophore- and structure-based virtual screening of the ZINC library, coupled with competitive binding and transactivation assays, and adipocyte differentiation and gene expression studies. Hit compound 9 was identified as the most potent ligand (IC50 = 0.3 μM) and a relatively poor inducer of adipocyte differentiation. The binding mode of compound 9 was confirmed by molecular dynamics simulation, and the calculated free energy of binding was -8.4 kcal/mol. A novel functional group, the CHEMICALNOTIN group, was identified to be a key substituent in the ligand-protein interactions. Further studies on the transcriptional regulation properties of compound 9 revealed a gene regulatory profile that was to a large extent unique, however functionally closer to that of a partial agonist.
23434648	Structural Characterization of an GENENOTIN GENENOTIN Mimetic with a Self-Assembling GENENOTIN Folding Constraint. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) structures are of interest as a means to understand biological signal transduction and as tools for therapeutic discovery. The growing number of GENENOTIN crystal structures demonstrates that the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) connecting the GENENOTIN show tremendous structural variability relative to the more structurally-conserved seven transmembrane GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN receptor have not yet been conclusively resolved, and bear limited sequence identity to known structures. This study involved development of a peptide to characterize the intrinsic structure of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN second GENENOTIN. The loop was embedded between two helices that assemble into a GENENOTIN, which served as a receptor-mimetic folding constraint (GENENOTIN-CC-GENENOTIN peptide). The ensemble of structures from multi-dimensional NMR experiments demonstrated that a robust GENENOTIN formed without noticeable deformation due to the GENENOTIN sequence. In contrast, the GENEIN sequence showed well-defined structure only near its CHEMICALIN-terminal residues. The NMR ensemble was combined with a computational model of the GENENOTIN receptor that had previously been validated. The resulting hybrid models were evaluated using docking. Nine different hybrid models interacted with CHEMICALNOTIN 18:1 as expected, based on prior mutagenesis studies, and one was additionally consistent with antagonist affinity trends.
23435615	The CHEMICALIN hydroxylation index reflects GENEIN activity in healthy Japanese volunteers. PURPOSE: CHEMICALIN has (R)- and (S)-enantiomers, which exhibit different pharmacokinetics (PK) among patients with GENEIN genotype groups. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the 1-point, 4-h postdose CHEMICALNOTIN hydroxylation index (HI) of CHEMICALNOTIN reflects the three GENENOTIN genotype groups in Japanese individuals. METHODS: Ninety healthy Japanese individuals were enrolled and classified into the three different GENENOTIN genotype groups: homozygous extensive metabolizers (hmEMs; n = 34), heterozygous EMs (htEMs; n = 44), and poor metabolizers (PMs; n = 12). Blood samples were drawn 4 h after the intake of an oral dose of CHEMICALNOTIN 40 mg, and plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolites were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a chiral column. RESULTS: Mean plasma concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN in PMs were significantly higher than those in hmEMs and htEMs, and similar results were obtained in the case of CHEMICALNOTIN. Additionally, there was a significant difference in plasma concentrations of CHEMICALIN among GENEIN genotype groups, whereas no significant differences were observed in that of CHEMICALIN. Similarly, CHEMICALNOTIN HI in hmEMs, htEMs, and PMs were 5.6, 3.1, and 0.3, respectively, which were significantly different, but no significant difference was present in the CHEMICALNOTIN HI. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that CHEMICALIN HI correlated better with GENEIN genotype groups than CHEMICALIN HI, and these results may be useful for classification among patients in GENENOTIN genotype groups prior to omeprazole treatment.
23439660	Induction of GENEIN, transporters, and drug metabolizing enzymes by CHEMICALIN. Perturbations of the expression of transporters and drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs) by opioids can be the locus of deleterious drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Many transporters and DMEs are regulated by GENENOTIN [GENENOTIN; e.g., GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)]; however, there is a paucity of information regarding the influence of opioids on GENENOTIN. The objective of this study was to determine the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN administration (15 mg/kg intraperitoneally twice daily for 8 days) on liver expression of GENENOTIN, transporters, and DMEs in rats. Microarray, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunoblotting analyses were used to identify significantly regulated genes. Three GENENOTIN (e.g., GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN), 27 transporters (e.g., GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), and 19 DMEs (e.g., GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) were regulated (P < 0.05) with fold changes ranging from -46.3 to 17.1. Using MetaCore (computational platform), we identified a unique gene-network of transporters and DMEs assembled around GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. Therefore, a series of transactivation/translocation assays were conducted to determine whether the observed changes of transporters/DMEs are mediated by direct activation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, or GENENOTIN by CHEMICALNOTIN or its major metabolites (CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN). Neither CHEMICALIN nor its metabolites activated GENEIN, GENEIN, or GENEIN. Taken together, these findings identify a signature hepatic gene-network associated with repeated CHEMICALNOTIN administration in rats and demonstrate that CHEMICALIN alters the expression of many transporters and DMEs (without direct activation of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN), which could lead to undesirable DDIs after coadministration of substrates of these transporters/DMEs with CHEMICALNOTIN.
23439872	Strain-dependent dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism in male mice is associated with choline- and folate-deficient diet-induced liver injury. Dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism-related metabolic processes is a major contributor to the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). It is well established that genetic and gender-specific variations in one-carbon metabolism contribute to the vulnerability to NAFLD in humans. To examine the role of one-carbon metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis and individual susceptibility to NAFLD, we used a "population-based" mouse model where male mice from 7 inbred were fed a choline- and folate-deficient (CFD) diet for 12 wk. Strain-dependent down-regulation of several key one-carbon metabolism genes, including methionine adenosyltransferase 1α (Mat1a), cystathionine-β-synthase (Cbs), methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (Mthfr), adenosyl-homocysteinase (Ahcy), and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1 (Mthfd1), was observed. These changes were strongly associated with interstrain variability in liver injury (steatosis, necrosis, inflammation, and activation of fibrogenesis) and hyperhomocysteinemia. Mechanistically, the decreased expression of Mat1a, Ahcy, and Mthfd1 was linked to a reduced level and promoter binding of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β (CEBPβ), which directly regulates their transcription. The strain specificity of diet-induced dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism suggests that interstrain variation in the regulation of one-carbon metabolism may contribute to the differential vulnerability to NFLD and that correcting the imbalance may be considered as preventive and treatment strategies for NAFLD.-Pogribny, I. P., Kutanzi, K., Melnyk, S., de Conti, A., Tryndyak, V., Montgomery, B., Pogribna, M., Muskhelishvili, L., Latendresse, J. R., James, S. J., Beland, F. A., Rusyn, I. Strain-dependent dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism in male mice is associated with choline- and folate-deficient diet-induced liver injury.
23440512	CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN signaling: genomic and non-genomic effects. CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN is arguably the most multifunctional CHEMICALNOTIN in the human body as it is essential from embryogenesis to adulthood. The pleiotropic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN are exerted mainly by one active metabolite, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which regulates the expression of a battery of target genes through several families of GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN and GENENOTIN), GENEIN and multiple coregulators. It also involves extra nuclear and non-transcriptional effects such as the activation of GENENOTIN cascades, which are integrated in the nucleus via the phosphorylation of several actors of RA signaling. However, CHEMICALNOTIN itself proved recently to be active and GENENOTIN to be present in the cytosol to regulate translation and cell plasticity. All these new concepts expand the scope of the biologic functions of CHEMICALNOTIN and RA.
23441017	Phase stability and elastic properties of chromium borides with various stoichiometries. Phase stability is important to the application of materials. By first-principles calculations, we establish the phase stability of chromium borides with various stoichiometries. Moreover, the phases of CrB3 and CrB4 have been predicted by using a newly developed particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Formation enthalpy-pressure diagrams reveal that the MoB-type structure is more energetically favorable than the TiI-type structure for CrB. For CrB2 , the WB2 -type structure is preferred at zero pressure. The predicted new phase of CrB3 belongs to the hexagonal P-6m2 space group and it transforms into an orthorhombic phase as the pressure exceeds 93 GPa. The predicted CrB4 (space group: Pnnm) phase is more energetically favorable than the previously proposed Immm structure. The mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities of predicted CrB3 and CrB4 are verified by the calculated elastic constants and formation enthalpies. The full phonon dispersion calculations confirm the dynamic stability of WB2 -type CrB2 and predicted CrB3 . The large shear moduli, large Young's moduli, low Poisson ratios, and low bulk and shear modulus ratios of CrB4 PSC and CrB4 PSD indicate that they are potential hard materials. Analyses of Debye temperature, electronic localization function, and electronic structure provide further understanding of the chemical and physical properties of these borides.
23443810	Effect of GENENOTIN on Renal Fibrosis by Regulating GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in kk-ay Diabetic Nephropathy Mice. MicroRNAs (miRs) play important roles in initiation and progression of many pathologic processes. However, the roles of miRs in diabetic nephropathy remain unclear. This study was to determine whether GENENOTIN was involved in diabetic nephropathy and to explore the relationship between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN expression in diabetic nephropathy. In situ hybridization studies showed that GENENOTIN was primarily localized and distributed in cortical glomerular and renal tubular cells in diabetic kk-ay kidney. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that the expression of GENENOTIN was significantly increased in kk-ay mice, compared with control C57BL mice. Interestingly, GENEIN expression positively correlated with urine GENENOTIN CHEMICALIN ratio (ACR), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN); while negatively correlated with CHEMICALIN clearance ratio (Ccr) and GENENOTIN protein. Importantly, antagomir-21 not only ameliorated Ccr and ACR but also decreased GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN proteins. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that GENENOTIN contributes to renal fibrosis by mediating GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and that inhibition of GENENOTIN may be a novel target for diabetic nephropathy.
23444386	Modification of the Catalytic Function of GENEIN by Formation of CHEMICALIN Bonds. The GENEIN catalyzes the sulfation of a broad range of xenobiotics, as well as endogenous CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Reversible modulation of the catalytic activity of this enzyme could play important roles in its physiologic functions. Whereas other GENENOTIN are known to be reversibly altered by changes in their redox environment, this has not been previously shown for GENENOTIN. We have examined the hypothesis that the formation of CHEMICALNOTIN bonds in GENENOTIN can reversibly regulate the catalytic function of the enzyme. Three CHEMICALNOTIN oxidants were used as model compounds to investigate their effects on homogeneous preparations of GENENOTIN: CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN) (CHEMICALNOTIN). Examination of the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN bond formation with these agents indicated that the activity of the enzyme is reversibly altered. Studies on the kinetics of the GENEIN-catalyzed sulfation of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) showed the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN bond formation on the substrate inhibition characteristics of the enzyme. The effects of these agents on the binding of substrates and products, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry identification of the CHEMICALNOTIN formed, and structural modeling of the modified enzyme were examined. Our results indicate that conformational changes at CHEMICALNOTIN near the CHEMICALNOTIN binding site affect the binding of both the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN to the enzyme, with the specific effects dependent on the structure of the resulting CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, the formation of CHEMICALIN bonds in GENEIN is a potentially important reversible mechanism for alterations in the rates of sulfation of both endogenous and xenobiotic substrates.
23448346	Synthesis of novel GENENOTIN antagonists using metal-catalyzed coupling reactions and characterization of their biological activity. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) antagonists are valuable in the treatment of GENENOTIN-positive human breast cancer. In this study, we designed and synthesized nine new derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN (E2) with a bulky side chain attached to its C-7α position, and determined their GENENOTIN antagonistic activity using in vitro bioassays. Four of the derivatives showed a strong inhibition of GENENOTIN transactivation activity in a luciferase reporter assay and blocked GENENOTIN interactions with coactivators. Similarly, these derivatives also strongly inhibited the growth of the GENENOTIN-positive human breast cancer cells. Computational docking analysis was conducted to model the interaction of these antagonists with the GENENOTIN and showed that they could tightly bind to the GENENOTIN in a manner similar to that of CHEMICALIN, a pure GENEIN antagonist. These results provide an example that attachment of a bulky side chain to the C-7α position of E2 can produce GENENOTIN antagonists with GENEIN affinity comparable to that of CHEMICALIN.
23449197	Discovery of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN): a potent and selective GENEIN inhibitor as a topical drug for alopecia. CHEMICALIN 11 (CHEMICALIN) was synthesized and evaluated as GENEIN (also known as GENEIN or GENEIN) inhibitor. Compound 11, a potent and selective GENENOTIN inhibitor, exhibited good enzyme inhibitory activity (IC50=4.8 nM) as well as inhibitory activity against GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN at a cellular level (IC50=17 nM). The introduction of a CHEMICALNOTIN group to the CHEMICALNOTIN ring in 1 and the break up of the planarity between the CHEMICALNOTIN ring and the CHEMICALNOTIN ring improved the solubility in the lotion base of 11. Furthermore, the topical application of 3% 11 lotion significantly inhibited GENENOTIN in mouse skin at 8 h after application (71% inhibition, compared with vehicle-treated animals).
23449888	ARF represses GENENOTIN transactivation in prostate cancer. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) signaling is essential for prostate cancer (PCa) development in humans. The initiation of prostate malignancy and progression to a castration-resistant stage are largely contributed by the modulation of GENENOTIN activity through its coregulatory proteins. We and others previously reported that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression is positively correlated with the disease progression and severity of PCa. Here, we provide evidence that GENENOTIN physically interacts with GENENOTIN and functions as an GENEIN corespressor in both an CHEMICALIN-dependent and CHEMICALIN-independent manner. Endogenous GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN in human and GENENOTIN in mouse) and GENENOTIN colocalize in both human PCa cells in vitro and PCa tissues of mouse and human in vivo. Overexpression of GENENOTIN in PCa cells significantly attenuates the activities of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-GENENOTIN. The forced expression of GENENOTIN in cells resulted in a suppression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression. Conversely, knockdown of endogenous GENENOTIN in human PCa cells with short hairpin RNA enhanced GENENOTIN transactivation activities in a dose-dependent and GENENOTIN-independent manner. Furthermore, we demonstrated that GENENOTIN binds to both the CHEMICALIN-terminal domain and the ligand-binding domain of GENEIN, and the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN is required for the interaction of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN proteins. GENENOTIN perturbs the CHEMICALIN-induced interaction between the CHEMICALIN terminus and CHEMICALIN terminus of GENEIN. Most importantly, we observed that the expression of GENENOTIN is reversely correlated with GENENOTIN in human prostate tissues. Taken together, our results reveal a novel function of GENENOTIN in modulation of GENENOTIN transactivation in PCa.
23454144	Role of oxidative stress in chemical allergens induced skin cells activation. Allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) is an important occupational and environmental disease caused by topical exposure to chemical allergens. It describes the adverse effects that may results when exposure to a chemical elicits a T cell-mediated inflammatory skin disease. The ability of contact sensitizers to induce the oxidative stress pathway in keratinocytes and dendritic cells has been confirmed by several authors. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can serve as essential second messengers mediating cellular responses resulting in immune cells activation. Oxidative stress may be the starter point, as it leads to the activation of transcription factors and signaling pathways, including NF-kB and p38 MAPK, which leads to the release of cytokines and chemokines. ROS are also involved in the activation of the NLRP3/NALP3 inflammasome, which is required to direct the proteolytic maturation of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18, which are all integral to the process of dendritic cells mobilization, migration and functional maturation. Moreover, emerging evidence correlates ROS to changes in the constitution of the extracellular microenvironment found to facilitate ACD. The purpose of this review is to provide both conceptual and technical frameworks on the role of oxidative stress in chemical allergy.
23454145	Relative expression of CHEMICALNOTIN transport-related proteins and inflammation markers through the induction of CHEMICALIN-mediated stress in Caco-2 cells. Human diets contain CHEMICALNOTIN oxidation products that can induce cytotoxic effects, mainly caused by CHEMICALNOTIN. However, CHEMICALNOTIN effects have been less extensively investigated. This study evaluates the production of inflammatory biomarkers (GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN) and the influence of gene expression transporters and enzymes related to CHEMICALNOTIN absorption and metabolism (GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN) produced by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN) in Caco-2 cells. These effects were linked to intracellular signaling pathways by using several inhibitors. Results showed CHEMICALNOTIN to have a greater proinflammatory potential than CHEMICALNOTIN. In non-pre-treated cells, only GENEIN were down-regulated by CHEMICALIN, showing a greater influence upon GENEIN expression. Cell-pre-incubation with GENEIN induced changes in GENEIN expression levels after CHEMICALIN-incubation; however, the energetic metabolism inhibition reduced GENEIN expression only in CHEMICALIN-incubated cells. In non-pre-treated cells, GENEIN was up-regulated by both CHEMICALIN. However, exposure to inhibitors down-regulated the expression levels, mainly in CHEMICALNOTIN-incubated cells. While GENENOTIN expression values in non-pre-treated cells were unchanged, exposure to inhibitors caused down-regulation of mRNA levels. These results suggest that internalization and excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN is probably influenced by [CHEMICALIN]i, which also could mediate GENEIN activity in POPs metabolism. However, energetic metabolism and reducing equivalents exert different influences upon the CHEMICALNOTIN internalization.
23454297	CHEMICALNOTIN treatment alters the extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis in platelets and lymphocytes of adult rats. This study evaluated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on ectonucleotidase activities such as GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in platelets and lymphocytes of rats, as well as in the profile of platelet aggregation. Animals were divided into five groups: I (control); II (oil); III (CHEMICALNOTIN 10mg/kg); IV (CHEMICALNOTIN 50mg/kg); and V (CHEMICALNOTIN 100mg/kg). Animals were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN diluted in oil for 30days. In platelets, CHEMICALNOTIN decreased the CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis and increased CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis in groups III, IV and V when compared to control (P<0.05). The 5'-nucleotidase activity was decreased, while GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities were increased in platelets of rats of groups III, IV and V (P<0.05). CHEMICALNOTIN reduced significantly the platelet aggregation in the animals of groups III, IV and V in relation to group I (P<0.05). In lymphocytes, the GENEIN and GENEIN activities were increased in all groups treated with CHEMICALIN when compared to control (P<0.05). These findings demonstrated that the enzymes were altered in tissues by CHEMICALNOTIN and this compound decreased the platelet aggregation suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN should be considered a potentially therapeutic agent in disorders related to the purinergic system.
23455323	Mutant GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN survival signaling depends on the GENENOTIN transcription factor. Approximately 50% of melanomas depend on mutant GENENOTIN for proliferation, metastasis and survival. The inhibition of oncogenic GENENOTIN with highly targeted compounds has produced remarkable albeit short-lived clinical responses in GENENOTIN mutant melanoma patients. Reactivation of signaling downstream of GENENOTIN is frequently associated with acquired resistance to GENENOTIN inhibitors, and the identification of GENENOTIN targets may provide new strategies for managing melanoma. Oncogenic GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) is known to promote the stabilizing phosphorylation of the anti-apoptotic protein GENENOTIN, implicated in melanoma survival and chemoresistance. We now show that GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) signaling also induces the transcription of GENENOTIN in melanocytes and melanoma. We demonstrate that activation of GENEIN CHEMICALIN-727 and CHEMICALIN-705 phosphorylations is promoted by GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) activity and that the GENENOTIN is dependent on a GENENOTIN consensus-site for GENENOTIN-mediated activation. Consequently, suppression of GENENOTIN activity disrupted GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN)-mediated induction of GENENOTIN and reduced melanoma cell survival. We propose that GENENOTIN has a central role in the survival and contributes to chemoresistance of GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) melanoma.Oncogene advance online publication, 4 March 2013; doi:10.1038/onc.2013.45.
23462233	GENENOTIN importance in vivo in xenobiotic metabolism: CHEMICALNOTIN nitroreduction in mice. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) metabolizes many xenobiotics in vitro, but its importance in vivo is usually unknown relative to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and other detoxification systems. Currently, the most important insecticides are CHEMICALIN, which are metabolized in vitro by GENEIN on reduction of the CHEMICALIN group and by GENEIN via oxidation reactions. The goal of this study was to establish the relative importance of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in vivo using the mouse model. The procedure was to reduce liver GENEIN activity by providing CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN in the drinking water or to use the GENENOTIN-deficient DBA/2 mouse strain. None of these approaches reduced GENENOTIN activity measured in vitro with an isozyme nonspecific substrate. Liver GENEIN activity was reduced by 45% with CHEMICALIN and 61% with CHEMICALIN and 81% in GENENOTIN-deficient mice relative to controls. When mice were treated ip with the major neonicotinoid CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), metabolism by GENEIN oxidation reactions was not appreciably affected, whereas the GENEIN-generated CHEMICALIN metabolite was decreased by 30% with CHEMICALIN and 56% with CHEMICALIN and 86% in the GENENOTIN-deficient mice. The other CHEMICALNOTIN nitroreduction metabolite, desnitro-CHEMICALNOTIN, was decreased by 55%, 65%, and 81% with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and in the GENENOTIN-deficient mice, respectively. Thus, decreasing liver GENEIN activity by three quite different procedures gave a corresponding decrease for in vivo reductive metabolites in the liver of CHEMICALIN-treated mice. Possible GENEIN involvement in CHEMICALIN metabolism in insects was evaluated using GENEIN-expressing and GENENOTIN-deficient Drosophila, but no differences were found in CHEMICALNOTIN nitroreduction or sensitivity between the two strains. This is the first study to establish the in vivo relevance of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN metabolism in mammals and one of the first for xenobiotics in general.
23462380	Non-front-fanged colubroid snakes: A current evidence-based analysis of medical significance. Non-front-fanged colubroid snakes (NFFC; formerly and artificially taxonomically assembled as "colubrids") comprise about 70% of extant snake species and include several taxa now known to cause lethal or life threatening envenoming in humans. Although the medical risks of bites by only a handful of species have been documented, a growing number of NFFC are implicated in medically significant bites. The majority of these snakes have oral products (Duvernoy's secretions, or venoms) with unknown biomedical properties and their potential for causing harm in humans is unknown. Increasingly, multiple NFFC species are entering the commercial snake trade posing an uncertain risk. Published case reports describing NFFC bites were assessed for evidence-based value, clinical detail and verified species identification. These data were subjected to meta-analysis and a hazard index was generated for select taxa. Cases on which we consulted or personally treated were included and subjected to the same assessment criteria. Cases involving approximately 120 species met the selection criteria, and a small subset designated Hazard Level 1 (most hazardous), contained 5 species with lethal potential. Recommended management of these cases included antivenom for 3 species, Dispholidus typus, Rhabdophis tiginis, Rhabdophis subminiatus, whereas others in this subset without commercially available antivenoms (Thelotornis spp.) were treated with plasma/erythrocyte replacement therapy and supportive care. Heparin, antifibrinolytics and/or plasmapheresis/exchange transfusion have been used in the management of some Hazard Level 1 envenomings, but evidence-based analysis positively contraindicates the use of any of these interventions. Hazard Level 2/3 species were involved in cases containing mixed quality data that implicated these taxa (e.g. Boiga irregularis, Philodryas olfersii, Malpolon monspessulanus) with bites that caused rare systemic effects. Recommended management may include use of GENEIN inhibitors (e.g. CHEMICALIN) and wound care on a case-by-case basis. Hazard level 3 species comprised a larger group capable of producing significant local effects only, often associated with a protracted bite (eg Heterodon nasicus, Borikenophis (Alsophis) portoricensis, Platyceps (Coluber) rhodorachis). Management is restricted to wound care. Bites by Hazard level 4 species comprised the majority of surveyed taxa and these showed only minor effects of no clinical importance. This study has produced a comprehensive evidence-based listing of NFFC snakes tabulated against medical significance of bites, together with best-practice management recommendations. This analysis assumes increasing importance, as there is growing exposure to lesser-known NFFC snakes, particularly in captive collections that may uncover further species of significance in the future. Careful and accurate documentation of bites by verified species of NFFC snakes is required to increase the evidence base and establish the best medical management approach for each species.
23462526	Cell cycle arrest, extracellular matrix changes and intrinsic apoptosis in human melanoma cells are induced by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) involves the selective accumulation of boron carriers in tumor tissue followed by irradiation with a thermal or epithermal neutron beam. This therapy is therefore a cellular irradiation suited to treat tumors that have infiltrated into healthy tissues. BNCT has been used clinically to treat patients with cutaneous melanomas which have a high mortality. Human normal melanocytes and melanoma cells were treated with BNCT at different boronophenylalanine concentrations for signaling pathways analysis. BNCT induced few morphological alterations in normal melanocytes, with a negligible increase in free radical production. Melanoma cells treated with BNCT showed significant extracellular matrix (ECM) changes and a significant cyclin D1 decrease, suggesting cell death by necrosis and apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, respectively. BNCT also induced a significant increase in cleaved caspase-3 and a decrease in the mitochondrial electrical potential with selectivity for melanoma cells. Normal melanocytes had no significant differences due to BNCT treatment, confirming the data from the literature regarding the selectivity of BNCT. The results from this study suggest that some signaling pathways are involved in human melanoma treatment by BNCT, such as cell cycle arrest, ECM changes and intrinsic apoptosis.
23465614	Anti-adipogenic CHEMICALNOTIN from Alnus hirsuta f. sibirica on 3T3-L1 cells. A new CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (1), was isolated along with seventeen known CHEMICALNOTIN (2-18) from the CHEMICALNOTIN extract of Alnus hirsuta f. sibirica leaves using bioactivity-guided fractionation. Among the isolated compounds, compounds 1 and 2 and 4-12 reduced lipid accumulation dose-dependently in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. Of the compounds active in the present assay system, the most potent compound 7, CHEMICALIN, significantly suppressed the induction of GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN) protein expression, and inhibited adipocyte differentiation induced by CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN agonist. It was demonstrated that compound 7 has anti-adipogenic activity mediated by the regulation of GENENOTIN dependent pathways.
23468189	CHEMICALIN: a unique class of GENEIN inhibitors. The interaction of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) plays a critical role in cancer metastasis by facilitating the homing of tumor cells to metastatic sites. Based on our previously published work on GENENOTIN antagonists, we have synthesized a series of CHEMICALIN that inhibit the GENEIN/GENEIN interaction. Analogue bioactivities were assessed with binding affinity and Matrigel invasion assays. Computer modeling was employed to evaluate a selection of the new analogues docked into the GENENOTIN X-ray structure and to rationalize discrepancies between the affinity and Matrigel in vitro assays. A lead compound displays nanomolar potency in the binding affinity assay (IC(50)=8.0 nM) and the Matrigel invasion assay (100 % blockade of invasion at 10 nM). These data demonstrate that CHEMICALIN are a unique class of GENEIN inhibitors with high potency.
2347042	Oncolytic activity and mechanism of action of a novel L-cysteine derivative, L-cysteine, ethyl ester, S-(N-methylcarbamate) monohydrochloride. A study on the oncolytic activity of the L-cysteine derivative L-cysteine, ethyl ester, S-(N-methylcarbamate) monohydrochloride (NSC 303861), revealed that the drug caused complete regression of the MX-1 human mammary tumor xenograft. The compound also exhibited moderate antitumor activity against murine leukemia P388 (T/C value of 169% at a daily dose of 400 mg/kg) and against M5076 sarcoma (T/C value of 135% at a daily dose of 600 mg/kg). The drug was inactive against B16 melanoma, Lewis lung, colon 38 and CD8F1 mammary carcinomas. The compound exhibited significant cytotoxicity against hepatoma 3924A cells in culture (LC50 = 6 microM). Studies on the mechanism of action revealed that the cytotoxicity of the drug could be partially abrogated by protecting hepatoma 3924A cells in culture with L-glutamine. At 6 h after injection of the compound (400 mg/kg) into rats bearing hepatoma 3924A, the pools of L-glutamine and L-glutamate in the tumor decreased to 33% and 71%, respectively, of control levels; the drug selectively inhibited the activities of L-glutamine-requiring enzymes of purine nucleotide biosynthesis, amidophosphoribosyltransferase, FGAM synthase, and GMP synthase, to 21%, 1%, and 69%, respectively, without significantly altering the activities of pyrimidine biosynthetic enzymes, carbamoylphosphate synthase II and CTP synthase. Measurement of the nucleotide concentrations further corroborated the actions of the drug on the purine nucleotide biosynthetic enzyme activities. Drug injection (400 mg/kg) in the hepatoma 3924A-bearing rats reduced the concentrations of IMP in the tumor to 52%, those of total adenylates to 52%, those of total guanylates to 57%, and those of NAD to 73%, without significantly perturbing the pyrimidine nucleotide pools. Studies on the mechanism of action of the L-cysteine derivative suggested that the compound behaved as an L-glutamine antagonist, selectively acting on the enzymes of purine nucleotide biosynthesis.
23470629	Measurement of Transport Activities of CHEMICALIN in GENEIN and GENEIN Using LC-MS/MS. A method has been developed for the measurement of transport activities in membrane vesicles obtained from Sf9 cells for CHEMICALNOTIN by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Calibration curves for the CHEMICALNOTIN were linear over the range of 10 to 2000 pmol/mL, and the detection limit was less than 1 pmol/mL for CHEMICALNOTIN using selected reaction monitoring analysis. The analytical method was applied to measurements of transport activities in membrane vesicles obtained from GENENOTIN-, and GENEIN-expressing Sf9 cells for conjugated CHEMICALIN. The present study demonstrated that GENEIN vesicles accepted conjugated CHEMICALIN along with common CHEMICALIN such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN.
23471969	An Intracellular Domain Fragment of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) Enhances GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) Receptor Function. Facilitation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) signaling by the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is critical for neuronal survival and differentiation. However, the interaction between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors required for this activity is not understood. Here, we report that a specific 29-CHEMICALIN peptide derived from the intracellular domain fragment of GENEIN interacts with and potentiates binding of GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN-expressing cells, leading to increased neurite outgrowth in sympathetic neurons as a result of enhanced GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN signaling. An endogenous intracellular domain fragment of GENEIN (GENEIN) containing these 29 CHEMICALIN is produced by regulated proteolysis of the full-length receptor. We demonstrate that generation of this fragment is a requirement for GENENOTIN to facilitate GENENOTIN signaling in neurons and propose that the juxtamembrane region of GENENOTIN acts to cause a conformational change within the extracellular domain of GENENOTIN. This finding provides new insight into the mechanism by which GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN interact to enhance neurotrophic signaling.
23474389	Synthesis and evaluation of CHEMICALIN as GENEIN inhibitory anticancer agents. A series of substituted CHEMICALIN has been synthesised and tested in vitro as potential pro-apoptotic GENEIN-inhibitory anticancer agents. Synthesis of the target compounds was readily accomplished in good yields through a cyclisation reaction between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN under basic conditions, followed by CHEMICALNOTIN-benzylation. Active compounds, such as the CHEMICALIN analogue 6c, were found to exhibit sub-micromolar IC50 values in GENEIN expressing human cancer cell lines. Molecular modelling and ELISA studies further implicated anti-apoptotic GENENOTIN as a candidate molecular target underpinning anticancer activity.
23475432	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative stress in male Wistar rats. Humans are commonly exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN, one of the most important lifestyle chemicals. The occurrence of high levels of CHEMICALNOTIN in the groundwater of the southeast region of Asia has received much attention in the past decade and has become a global health concern. Predominant occurrence of both these chemicals and ease of their human exposure led us to investigate the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, a major tobacco alkaloid, on CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity. Adult male rats were pre-exposed to two different doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.75 and 3 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) for 7 days followed by 30 days of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure (50 ppm CHEMICALNOTIN in drinking water). CHEMICALNOTIN pre-exposure resulted in an increased brain CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation and a decreased liver CHEMICALNOTIN concentration. CHEMICALNOTIN also caused a significant oxidative stress in the blood, brain and liver of the exposed rats. GENEIN, a phase II enzyme, was inhibited by both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN but no such inhibition was noted in CHEMICALIN-treated animals pre-exposed to CHEMICALIN. Upon CHEMICALIN pre-exposure, brain GENEIN increased, while GENEIN (GENEIN) decreased. The toxic effects of GENEIN significantly attenuated with CHEMICALIN pre-exposure. The present study suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN may not be the major contributing factor for the previously reported synergistic toxic interaction between tobacco and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN pre-exposure in CHEMICALNOTIN-exposed animals revealed interesting toxicokinetics and oxidative stress modulating interactions in the brain and liver of rats, which requires further exploration.
23475784	Developing Predictive Approaches to Characterize Adaptive Responses of the Reproductive Endocrine Axis to GENENOTIN Inhibition: II. Computational Modeling. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals can affect reproduction and development in humans and wildlife. We developed a computational model of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis in female fathead minnows to predict dose-response and time-course (DRTC) behaviors for endocrine effects of the GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). The model describes adaptive responses to endocrine stress involving regulated secretion of a generic GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) from the hypothalamic-pituitary complex. For model development, we used plasma CHEMICALNOTIN (E2) concentrations and ovarian GENENOTIN mRNA data from two time-course experiments, each of which included both an exposure and a depuration phase, and plasma E2 data from a third 4-day study. Model parameters were estimated using E2 concentrations for 0, 0.5, and 3 µg/l CHEMICALNOTIN exposure concentrations, and good fits to these data were obtained. The model accurately predicted GENEIN mRNA fold changes for controls and three CHEMICALIN doses (0, 0.5, and 3 µg/l) and plasma E2 dose response from the 4-day study. Comparing the model-predicted DRTC with experimental data provided insight into how the feedback control mechanisms in the HPG axis mediate these changes: specifically, adaptive changes in plasma E2 levels occurring during exposure and "overshoot" occurring postexposure. This study demonstrates the value of mechanistic modeling to examine and predict dynamic behaviors in perturbed systems. As this work progresses, we will obtain a refined understanding of how adaptive responses within the vertebrate HPG axis affect DRTC behaviors for GENENOTIN inhibitors and other types of endocrine-active chemicals and apply that knowledge in support of risk assessments.
23478802	CHEMICALIN Reveals a CHEMICALIN-Dependent Desensitization Mechanism of GENEIN. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN nonselective GENENOTIN has a conserved function as a noxious chemical sensor throughout much of Metazoa. Electrophilic chemicals activate both insect and vertebrate GENEIN via covalent modification of CHEMICALIN residues in the CHEMICALIN-terminal region. Although naturally occurring electrophilic plant compounds, such as mustard oil and CHEMICALIN, are GENEIN agonists, it is unknown whether arthropod-produced electrophiles activate GENENOTIN. We characterized the effects of the electrophilic arthropod defensive compound CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on the GENENOTIN channel. We used whole-cell recordings of human embryonic kidney cells heterologously expressing either wild-type GENENOTIN or GENEIN with three CHEMICALIN-substituted CHEMICALIN crucial for electrophile activation (GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN). We found that CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN starting at 10 nM and peaking at 300 nM; higher concentrations caused rapid activation followed by a fast decline. Activation by CHEMICALNOTIN required reactivity with CHEMICALNOTIN residues, but ones that are distinct from those previously reported to be the key targets of electrophiles. The current reduction we found at higher CHEMICALIN concentrations was a cysteine-dependent desensitization of GENEIN, and did not require prior activation. The CHEMICALNOTIN required for desensitization are not accessible to all electrophiles as CHEMICALNOTIN and internally applied CHEMICALNOTIN failed to cause desensitization (despite large activation). Interestingly, following CHEMICALIN desensitization, wild-type GENEIN had dramatically reduced response to the nonelectrophile agonist CHEMICALIN, whereas the triple CHEMICALIN mutant GENEIN retained its full response. Our results suggest that modification of multiple CHEMICALIN residues by electrophilic compounds can generate both activation and desensitization of the GENEIN channel.
23479059	A study of parabens and bisphenol A in surface water and fish brain tissue from the Greater Pittsburgh Area. Pollution from xenoestrogens has been discovered in the aquatic environment of the Greater Pittsburgh Area and is suspected to be caused by the failing sewer system. Personal care products and plasticizers have the potential to enter the water supply though treated and untreated sewage. Many of these compounds are suspected xenoestrogens. Paraben detection in surface waters was as follows: methyl paraben ranged between 2.2 to 17.3 ppt; ethyl paraben was not detectable; propyl paraben was detected at 9.2 and 12.0 ppt; butyl paraben was detected at 0.2 ppt. BPA was detected between 0.6 and 15.4 ppt. Estrogenic potential of extracts from fish brain tissue was tested via Bromodeoxyuridine MCF-7 analysis and paired with HPLC-MS to investigate the presence of xenoestrogens. All samples were non-detectable for parabens. BPA was detected in 44 of the 58 samples, with a range from non-detectable to 120 pg/g. BCFs were calculated. Results were statistically significant for location of capture (p < 0.05) and correlation existed between estrogenicity and BPA.
23479193	Synthesis and in-silico studies of some CHEMICALIN derivatives as potential GENEIN inhibitors. The synthesis of several CHEMICALNOTIN possessing N-2 CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN substituents, is reported. Several of them exhibited a low nanomolar GENENOTIN enzyme inhibition activity. Most of the compounds showed inhibition of edema was similar to that evoked by CHEMICALNOTIN in animal model. Molecular docking studies of the compounds into the binding sites of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN allowed us to shed light on the binding mode of these novel GENENOTIN inhibitors.
23479738	Multilevel regulation of GENENOTIN reaction cycle by s-nitrosylation. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), formed by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN-nitrosylation, and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a prominent reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species, are implicated in diverse physiological and pathological processes. Recent research has shown that the cellular action and metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN involve overlapping, CHEMICALNOTIN-based mechanisms, but how these reactive species may affect each other's fate and function is not well understood. In this study we investigated how CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN may affect the redox cycle of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a representative of the GENENOTIN, a group of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-dependent GENENOTIN. We found that, both in a cell-free system and in cells, CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN donors such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN readily induced the CHEMICALIN-nitrosylation of GENEIN, causing structural and functional alterations. In particular, nitrosylation promoted CHEMICALNOTIN formation involving the pair of catalytic CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN-52 and CHEMICALIN-173) and disrupted the oligomeric structure of GENEIN, leading to loss of GENEIN activity. A highly potent inhibition of the GENEIN catalytic reaction by CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN was seen in assays employing the coupled GENEIN-GENEIN system. In this setting, CHEMICALIN (10 μm) effectively blocked the GENEIN-mediated regeneration of GENEIN. This effect appeared to be due to both competition between CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN for the GENEIN system and direct modulation by CHEMICALIN of GENEIN activity. Our findings that CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN target both GENEIN and GENEIN may have implications for understanding the impact of nitrosylation on cellular redox homeostasis.
23480597	A Novel CUG(exp)·MBNL1 Inhibitor with Therapeutic Potential for Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is caused by an expanded CUG repeat (CUG(exp)) that sequesters muscleblind-like 1 protein (MBNL1), a protein that regulates alternative splicing. CUG(exp) RNA is a validated drug target for this currently untreatable disease. Herein, we develop a bioactive small molecule (1) that targets CUG(exp) RNA and is able to inhibit the CUG(exp)·MBNL1 interaction in cells that model DM1. The core of this small molecule is based on ligand 2, which was previously reported to be active in an in vitro assay. A polyamine-derivative side chain was conjugated to this core to make it aqueous-soluble and cell-penetrable. In a DM1 cell model this conjugate was found to disperse CUG(exp) ribonuclear foci, release MBNL1, and partially reverse the mis-splicing of the insulin receptor pre-mRNA. Direct evidence for ribonuclear foci dispersion by this ligand was obtained in a live DM1 cell model using time-lapse confocal microscopy.
23483103	The induction of mitochondria-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells by ruthenium(ii) asymmetric complexes. Four ruthenium(ii) asymmetric complexes, [Ru(bpy)2(PAIDH)](2+) (bpy = 2,2'-bipyridine, PAIDH = 2-pyridyl-1H-anthra[1,2-d]imidazole-6,11-dione, ), [Ru(phen)2(PAIDH)](2+) (phen = 1,10-phenanthroline, ), [Ru(dmp)2(PAIDH)](2+) (dmp = 4,7-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline, ) and [Ru(dip)2(PAIDH)](2+) (dip = 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline, ), have been synthesized and characterized. These complexes displayed potent anti-proliferation activity against various cancer cell lines and had high selectivity between tumor cells and normal cells. HeLa cells exhibited the highest sensitivity to complex , accounting for the greatest cellular uptake. Complex was shown to accumulate preferentially in the mitochondria of HeLa cells and induced apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway, which involved ROS generation, mitochondrial membrane potential depolarisation, and Bcl-2 and caspase family members activation. These results demonstrated that complex induced cancer cell apoptosis by acting on mitochondrial pathways.
23485615	Platycodi Radix attenuates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced liver fibrosis in rats by inducing GENENOTIN-mediated antioxidant enzymes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the anti-fibrotic effects of the aqueous extract of the Platycodi Radix root (Changkil: CK) on CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced liver fibrosis in rats. CHEMICALIN treatment for 4weeks led to marked liver fibrosis as assessed by serum biochemistry, histopathological examination, and hepatic lipid peroxidation and GENEIN content. CK significantly inhibited CHEMICALIN-induced increases in serum GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) activities, fibrosis score, and hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN content. CK also inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-induced reductions in rat body and liver weights. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blot analyses revealed that CK inhibited CHEMICALIN-induced increases in GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), and GENEIN (GENEIN) mRNA, and GENEIN and GENEIN protein. CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN (GENEIN) expression and GENEIN (GENEIN) activation was reduced by CK treatment. Furthermore, CK induced activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-mediated antioxidant enzymes such as GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in HepG2 cells. These results demonstrated that CK attenuates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced liver fibrosis through the activation of GENENOTIN-mediated antioxidant enzymes.
23485651	CHEMICALNOTIN quantum dots cause oxidative stress leading to extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. The mechanisms of toxicity related to human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cell exposures to CHEMICALNOTIN quantum dots (CHEMICALNOTIN-QDs) were investigated. CHEMICALNOTIN-QDs caused cytotoxicity in HepG2 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Treated cells showed an increase in reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS). Altered antioxidant levels were demonstrated by depletion of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a decreased ratio of reduced CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN) and an increased GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation. Enzyme assays showed that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity was elevated whereas GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activities were depressed. Further analyses revealed that CHEMICALIN-QD exposure resulted in apoptosis, indicated by changes in levels of GENEIN activity, GENEIN (GENEIN) cleavage and CHEMICALNOTIN externalization. Extrinsic apoptotic pathway markers such as GENEIN levels and GENEIN activity increased as a result of CHEMICALIN-QD exposure. Involvement of the intrinsic/mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was indicated by decreased levels of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) protein and mitochondrial GENENOTIN, and by increased levels of mitochondrial GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and cytosolic GENENOTIN. Further, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) such as GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN were all activated. Our findings reveal that CHEMICALIN-QDs cause oxidative stress, interfere with antioxidant defenses and activate protein GENEIN, leading to apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Since the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN-QDs on selected biomarkers were similar or greater compared to those of CHEMICALNOTIN at equivalent concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN, the study suggests that the toxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN-QDs arises from a combination of the effects of cadmium and ROS generated from the NPs.
23494236	Reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine via smoking. RATIONALE: In animals, nicotine enhances reinforcement from stimuli unrelated to nicotine intake. Human research is suggestive but has not clearly shown a similar influence of nicotine. OBJECTIVES: We assessed acute effects of nicotine via smoking on enhancement of positive (money, music) or negative (termination of noise) reinforcers, or no "reward" (control). These different rewards determined the generalizability of nicotine effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dependent (n = 25) and nondependent (n = 27) smokers participated in three sessions, each after overnight abstinence. Using a within-subjects design, sessions involved no smoking or smoking denicotinized (0.05 mg) or nicotine (0.6 mg) Quest(R) brand cigarettes. For comparison, a fourth session involved no abstinence prior to smoking one's own brand to gauge responses under typical nicotine satiation. Reinforcement was assessed by responses on a simple operant computer task for the rewards, each available singly on a progressive ratio schedule during separate trials. RESULTS: The reinforcing effect of music, but not other rewards, was greater due to the nicotine cigarette, compared to the denicotinized cigarette or no smoking. Reinforcement enhancing effects of nicotine did not differ between dependent and nondependent groups, indicating no influence of withdrawal relief. Responding due to acute nicotine after abstinence was very similar to responding to one's own brand after no abstinence. CONCLUSIONS: Acute nicotine intake per se from smoking after abstinence enhances the reinforcing value of rewards unassociated with smoking, perhaps in a manner comparable to ad lib smoking after no abstinence. Nicotine's reinforcement enhancing effects may be specific to certain rewards, perhaps those sensory in nature.
23500061	Anti-apoptotic cardioprotective effects of GENENOTIN gene silencing against ischemia-reperfusion injury: Use of CHEMICALNOTIN-modified low molecular weight CHEMICALNOTIN as a cardiac siRNA-carrier. The cardiomyocyte apoptosis plays a critical role in the development of myocardial injury after ischemia and reperfusion. Thus, alteration of the major apoptosis-regulatory factors during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion is expected to have favorable cardioprotective effects. Herein, we report ischemic-reperfused myocardial infarction (MI) repair with siRNA against GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which is known as a key factor involved in regulating the progress of apoptosis in many cell types. A low molecular weight CHEMICALIN modified with CHEMICALIN (PEI1.8-DA)-based delivery strategy was suggested for the cardiac application of GENEIN siRNA to overcome the poor gene delivery efficiency to myocardium due to the highly charged structures of the compact cardiac muscles. The PEI1.8-DA conjugates formed stable nanocomplexes with GENENOTIN siRNA via electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions. The PEI1.8-DA/GENENOTIN siRNA polyplexes effectively silenced GENENOTIN gene expression in cardiomyocytes, leading to a significant inhibition of cardiomyocyte apoptosis under hypoxia. In comparison to conventional gene carriers, relatively large amounts of siRNA molecules remained after treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/GENENOTIN siRNA polyplexes. Cardiac administration of the PEI1.8-DA/GENENOTIN siRNA polyplexes resulted in substantial improvement in GENENOTIN gene silencing, which can be explained by the enhancement of cardiac delivery efficiency of the PEI1.8-DA conjugates. In addition, in vivo treatment with the PEI1.8-DA/GENENOTIN siRNA polyplexes induced a highly significant reduction in myocardial apoptosis and infarct size in rat MI models. These results demonstrate that the PEI1.8-DA/GENENOTIN siRNA polyplex formulation is a useful system for efficient gene delivery into the compact myocardium that provides a fundamental advantage in treating ischemic-reperfused MI.
23500411	Synthesis of C17-OH-north unit of ritterazine G via "Red-Ox" modifications of hecogenin acetate. The C17-OH-north unit of ritterazine G was prepared in 13 steps from hecogenin acetate. This synthesis features a highly efficient and stereoselective introduction of the C17-OH via E-ring cleavage/F-ring formation, D-ring oxidation, and F-ring cleavage/E-ring formation.
23507868	Inhibitory effects of in vivo oxidized high-density lipoproteins on platelet aggregation: evidence from patients with abetalipoproteinemia. There is evidence that high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) may regulate platelet function, but disparate results exist regarding the effects of oxidized HDLs on platelets. The objective of our study was to determine the role of in vivo oxidized HDLs on platelet aggregation. Platelet aggregation and redox status were investigated in 5 patients with abetalipoproteinemia (ABLP) or homozygous hypobetalipoproteinemia, two rare metabolic diseases characterized by the absence of apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins, compared to 5 control subjects. Platelets isolated from plasma of patients with ABLP aggregated 4 to 10 times more than control platelets, depending on the agonist. By contrast, no differences in the extent of platelet aggregation were observed between ABLP platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and control PRP, suggesting the presence of a protective factor in ABLP plasma. ABLP HDLs inhibited agonist-induced platelet aggregation by binding to SR-BI, while control HDLs had no effect. On the other hand, lipoprotein-deficient plasma from patients with ABLP did not inhibit platelet aggregation. Severe oxidative stress was evidenced in patients with ABLP. Compared to control HDLs, ABLP HDLs showed a 40% decrease of α-tocopherol and an 11-fold increased malondialdehyde concentration. These results demonstrate that in vivo oxidized HDLs do not lose their antiaggregatory properties despite oxidation.-Calzada, C., Véricel, E., Colas, R., Guillot, N., El Khoury, G., Drai, J., Sassolas, A., Peretti, N., Ponsin, G., Lagarde, M., Moulin, P. Inhibitory effects of in vivo oxidized high-density lipoproteins on platelet aggregation: evidence from patients with abetalipoproteinemia.
23511088	Derivatives of Dictyostelium discoideum differentiation-inducing factor-3 suppress the activities of Trypanosoma cruzi in vitro and in vivo. Chagas disease (human American trypanosomiasis), which is caused by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi, is responsible for numerous deaths each year; however, established treatments for the disease are limited. Differentiation-inducing factor-1 (DIF-1) and DIF-3 are chlorinated alkylphenones originally found in the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum that have been shown to possess pharmacological activities. Here, we investigated the effects of DIF-3 derivatives on the infection rate and growth of T. cruzi by using an in vitro assay system utilizing host human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Certain DIF-3 derivatives, such as butoxy-DIF-3 (Bu-DIF-3), at micro-molar levels strongly suppressed both the infection rate and growth of T. cruzi in HT1080 cells and exhibited little toxicity for HT1080 cells. For example, the IC50 of DIF-3 and Bu-DIF-3 versus the growth of T. cruzi in HT1080 cells were 3.95 and 0.72μM, respectively, and the LD50 of the two compounds versus HT1080 cells were both greater than 100μM. We also examined the effects of DIF-3 and Bu-DIF-3 on T. cruzi activity in C57BL/6 mice. Intraperitoneally administered Bu-DIF-3 (50mg/kg) significantly suppressed the number of trypomastigotes in blood with no apparent adverse effects. These results strongly suggest that DIF-3 derivatives could be new lead compounds in the development of anti-trypanosomiasis drugs.
23512787	Neuroprotective Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN induced Parkinson's Disease Model in Mice. CHEMICALNOTIN, an active component of Pueraria montana var. lobata (Willd.) Sanjappa & Pradeep is well-known for its anti-oxidative and neuroprotective activities. Although anti-Parkinson's disease activity of CHEMICALNOTIN was reported in both of in vivo and in vitro model, detailed mechanisms are not clarified. In this study, we addressed that CHEMICALNOTIN attenuated CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced behavioral deficits, dopaminergic neuronal degeneration and CHEMICALNOTIN depletion. CHEMICALIN administration enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) activity, GENEIN (GENEIN) expression and GENEIN/GENEIN pathway activation, which might ameliorate CHEMICALNOTIN injection-induced progressive elevation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) formation in mice. In addition to the effect on ROS, CHEMICALIN ameliorated CHEMICALIN-reduced GENEIN (GENEIN) expression. Taken together, our data demonstrate that CHEMICALIN attenuates CHEMICALIN-induced dopaminergic neuronal degeneration via modulating GENEIN expression, GENEIN/GENEIN pathway and CHEMICALNOTIN activation, which subsequently ameliorate CHEMICALIN-induced ROS formation and decrease of GENEIN expression.

23517729	Efficient induction of apoptosis in HeLa cells by a novel cationic CHEMICALNOTIN photosensitizer. In the present study we analyze the photobiological properties of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in Hela cells, in order to assess its potential as a new photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy of cultured tumor cells. Using 0.5 μM CHEMICALNOTIN, flow cytometry studies demonstrated an increase of intracellular drug levels related to the incubation time, reaching a maximum at 18 h. LysoTracker(®) Green (LTG) and MitoTracker(®) Green (MTG) probes were used to identify the subcellular localization. Upon exposure to ultraviolet excitation, red CHEMICALNOTIN fluorescence was detected as red granules in the cytoplasm that colocalized with LTG. No significant toxic effects were detected for CHEMICALNOTIN in the dark at concentrations below 1 μM. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN combined with red-light irradiation induced concentration- and fluence-dependent HeLa cells inactivation. Besides, all photodynamic protocols assayed induced a clear effect of cell detachment inhibition after GENENOTIN treatment. Both apoptotic and necrotic cell death mechanisms can occur in HeLa cells depending on the experimental protocol. After 18 h incubation with 0.5 μM CHEMICALIN and subsequent red light irradiation (3.6 J/cm(2)), a high number of cells die by apoptosis, as evaluated by morphological alterations, immunofluorescent relocalization of GENEIN from cytosol to mitochondria, and TUNEL assay. Likewise, immunofluorescence techniques showed that GENENOTIN is released from mitochondria into cytosol in cells undergoing apoptosis, which occurs immediately after relocation of GENENOTIN in mitochondria. The highest amount of apoptosis appeared 24 h after treatment (70%) and this cell death occurred without cell detachment to the substrate. In contrast, with 0.75 μM CHEMICALNOTIN and 3.6 J/cm(2) irradiation, morphological changes showed a preferential necrotic cell death. Singlet CHEMICALNOTIN was identified as the cytotoxic agent involved in cell photoinactivation. Moreover, cell cultures pre-exposed to the singlet CHEMICALNOTIN scavenger CHEMICALNOTIN showed pronounced protection against the loss of viability induced by CHEMICALNOTIN and light. Different changes in distribution and organization of cytoskeletal elements (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN microfilaments) as well as the protein GENENOTIN, after apoptotic and necrotic photodynamic treatments have been analyzed. Neither of these two cell death mechanisms (apoptosis or necrosis) induced cell detachment. In summary, CHEMICALNOTIN appears to meet the requirements for further scrutiny as a very good photosensitizer for photodynamic therapy: it is water soluble, has a high absorption in the red spectral region (where light penetration in tissue is higher), and is able to induce effective high apoptotic rate (70%) related to the more widely studied photosensitizers.
23522564	Addition of artificial salt bridge by GENENOTIN mutation in GENENOTIN regulates 6-helical bundle formation. HIV entry is mediated by the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The GENEIN subunit contains several functional domains: the CHEMICALIN-terminal heptad repeat (NHR) domains fold a triple stranded coiled-coil forming a meta-stable prefusion intermediate. CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal heptad repeat (CHR) subsequently folds onto the hydrophobic grooves of the NHR coiled-coil to form a stable 6-helix bundle, which juxtaposes the viral and cellular membranes for fusion. The C34 which has 34 CHEMICALNOTIN residues is known as the core structure in CHR. A highly anti-HIV peptide inhibitor derived from C34 was designed. An artificial salt bridge was added in the 6-helical bundle by substitution of CHEMICALNOTIN for CHEMICALNOTIN646. With a CHEMICALNOTIN modification at CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal, the inhibitor containing GENENOTIN mutation represented higher anti-viral activity than C34-CHEMICALNOTIN combination without mutation.
23523831	Cytotoxic mechanism of Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth essential oil and its major compound CHEMICALNOTIN. Piper gaudichaudianum Kunth is used in popular medicine as anti-inflamatory and against liver disorders. One of the most studied components of the plant is the essential oil for which chemical analysis revealed CHEMICALNOTIN as major compound. Recently, we have shown that P. gaudichaudianum essential oil possesses strong cytotoxic effects in mammalian V79 cells. The aim of this study was to analyze the cytotoxicity and mutagenicity of P. gaudichaudianum essential oil and CHEMICALNOTIN using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as model study. Treatment of the XV185-14c and N123 strains with essential oil and CHEMICALNOTIN led to cytotoxicity but did not induce mutagenicity. Our results revealed an important role of base excision repair (BER) as the GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN mutants showed pronounced sensitivity to essential oil and CHEMICALIN. In the absence of GENENOTIN (in GENENOTINΔ mutant strain) sensitivity to the essential oil and CHEMICALNOTIN increased indicating that this oil and CHEMICALNOTIN are generating reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS). The ROS production was confirmed by CHEMICALNOTIN probing assay in GENENOTIN-deficient strains. From this, we conclude that the observed cytotoxicity to P. gaudichaudianum essential oil and CHEMICALNOTIN is mainly related to ROS and DNA single strand breaks generated by the presence of oxidative lesions.
23524160	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives as potential antidepressant agents. Part 1. A series of 3-(1H-indol-3-yl)pyrrolidine-2,5-dione derivatives was synthesized and their biological activity was evaluated. The chemical structures of the newly prepared compounds were confirmed by (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and ESI-HRMS spectra data. All tested compounds proved to be potent 5-HT1A receptor and serotonin transporter protein (SERT) ligands. Among them, compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 showed significant affinity for 5-HT1A and SERT. Computer docking simulations carried out for compounds 15, 31 and 32 to models of 5-HT1A receptor and SERT confirm the results of biological tests. Due to high affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor and moderate affinity for SERT, compounds 31, 32, 35, and 37 were evaluated for their affinity for D2L, 5-HT6, 5-HT7 and 5-HT2A receptors. In vivo tests, in turn, resulted in determining the functional activity of compounds 15, 18, 19 and 30 to the 5-HT1A receptor. The results of these tests indicate that all of the ligands possess properties characteristic of 5-HT1A receptor agonists.
23524663	Metabolism Studies of Unformulated Internally [CHEMICALNOTIN]-labeled siRNAs in Mice. Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion properties of two unformulated model siRNAs were determined using a single internal [CHEMICALNOTIN]-radiolabeling procedure, where the full-length oligonucleotides were radiolabeled by CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN-exchange. Tissue distribution, excretion, and mass balance of radioactivity were investigated in male CD-1 mice, following a single intravenous administration of the [CHEMICALNOTIN]-siRNAs, at a target dose level of 5 mg/kg. Quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) and liquid scintillation counting techniques were used to determine tissue distribution. Radiochromatogram profiles were determined in plasma, tissue extracts and urine. Metabolites were separated by liquid chromatography and identified by radiodetection and high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry. In general, there was little difference in the distribution of total radiolabeled components after administration of the two unformulated [CHEMICALNOTIN]-siRNAs. The radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed throughout the body, and remained detectable in all tissues investigated at later time points (24 and 48 hours for [CHEMICALIN]-GENEIN and [CHEMICALNOTIN]-SSB siRNA, respectively). After an initial rapid decline, concentrations of total radiolabeled components in dried blood declined at a much slower rate. A nearly complete mass balance was obtained for the [CHEMICALNOTIN]-SSB siRNA and renal excretion was the main route of elimination (38%). The metabolism of the two model siRNAs was rapid and extensive. Five minutes after administration, no parent compound could be detected in plasma. Instead, radiolabeled CHEMICALIN resulting from GENEIN hydrolysis were observed. In the metabolism profiles obtained from various tissues only radiolabeled CHEMICALNOTIN were found, suggesting that siRNAs are rapidly metabolized and that the distribution pattern of total radiolabeled components can be ascribed to small molecular weight metabolites.
23525902	Chemical genetic analyses of quantitative changes in GENENOTIN activity during the human cell cycle. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) controls cell proliferation and is inhibited by promising anticancer agents, but its mode of action and the consequences of its inhibition are incompletely understood. GENENOTIN promotes S- and M-phases during the cell-cycle but also suppresses endoreduplication, which is associated with polyploidy and genome instability. The complexity of GENENOTIN regulation has made it difficult to determine whether these different roles require different thresholds of GENENOTIN activity and whether the surge of activity as inhibitory CHEMICALNOTIN are removed at mitotic onset is essential for cell proliferation. Here, we have used chemical genetics in a human cell line to address these issues. We rescued cells lethally depleted of endogenous GENENOTIN with an exogenous GENEIN conferring sensitivity to one CHEMICALNOTIN analogue inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) and resistance to another (CHEMICALIN). At no CHEMICALIN concentration was mitosis in rescued clones prevented without also inducing endoreduplication, suggesting that these two key roles for GENEIN are not simply controlled by different GENENOTIN activity thresholds. We also rescued CHEMICALIN-resistant clones using exogenous GENEIN without inhibitory phosphorylation sites, indicating that the mitotic surge of GENENOTIN activity is dispensable for cell proliferation. These results suggest that the basic mammalian cycle requires at least some qualitative changes in GENENOTIN activity and that quantitative increases in activity need not be rapid. Furthermore, the viability of cells that are unable to undergo rapid GENENOTIN activation, and the strong association between endoreduplication and impaired proliferation, may place restrictions on the therapeutic use of a GENENOTIN inhibitors.
23526644	Inhibition of Ebola Virus Infection: Identification of Niemann-Pick C1 as the Target by Optimization of a Chemical Probe. A high throughput screen identified adamantane dipeptide 1 as an inhibitor of Ebola virus (EboV) infection. Hit-to-lead optimization to determine the structure-activity relationship (SAR) identified the more potent EboV inhibitor 2 and a photoaffinity labeling agent 3. These anti-viral compounds were employed to identify the target as Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a host protein that binds the EboV glycoprotein and is essential for infection. These studies establish NPC1 as a promising target for anti-viral therapy.
23527317	Exploring the effect of CHEMICALIN-substitution in CHEMICALIN on the interaction with GENEIN: discovery of a potential clinical candidate for treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN abuse. A series of CHEMICALIN-substituted CHEMICALIN analogues was synthesized and evaluated for their CHEMICALIN binding affinity at the GENEIN and for their inhibition of vesicular CHEMICALIN uptake. Compound 19a, which contains an CHEMICALNOTIN group, had been identified as a potential clinical candidate for the treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN abuse.
23527529	The pre-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties of CHEMICALNOTIN, an orally bioavailable antagonist of the hedgehog signal transduction pathway. Abstract 1. CHEMICALNOTIN is a novel semisynthetic CHEMICALNOTIN derivative that is a potent and selective Smoothened inhibitor that blocks the hedgehog signal transduction pathway. 2. The in vivo clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN is low in mouse and dog and moderate in monkey. The volume of distribution is high across species. Oral bioavailability ranges from moderate in monkey to high in mouse and dog. Predicted human clearance using simple allometry is low (24 L h(-1)), predicted volume of distribution is high (469 L) and predicted half-life is long (20 h). 3. CHEMICALIN is highly bound to plasma proteins and has minimal interaction with GENEIN. 4. In vitro metabolic stability ranges from stable to moderately stable. Twelve oxidative metabolites were detected in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human liver microsome incubations and none were unique to human. 5. CHEMICALNOTIN is not a potent reversible inhibitor of GENENOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN is a moderate inhibitor of GENENOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) with KI values of 19, 16 and 4.5 µM, respectively. CHEMICALIN is both a substrate and inhibitor (IC50 = 1.9 µM) of GENEIN. 6. In summary, CHEMICALNOTIN has desirable pre-clinical absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties.
23528363	Protection of glycyrrhizic acid against AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction through inhibiting RAGE/NF-κB pathway activation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis roots) is used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of diabetes mellitus and its vascular complications. Glycyrrhizic acid (GA, also known as Glycyrrhizin), a triterpenoid saponin glycoside, is considered to be a bioactive component in Licorice and is beneficial to diabetic vascular complications. AIM OF STUDY: The present study was conducted to evaluate the potential protective activities on AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction, including anti-apoptosis, antioxidant stress and anti-proinflammatory responses, and explore the underlying mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated and pre-treated with GA (10(-9)-10(-6)M) or RAGE-Ab (5μg/ml) in the presence or absence of 200μg/ml AGEs. AO/EB fluorescence staining assay was performed to evaluate anti-apoptosis activity. The superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and malondialdehyde (MDA) level in cell supernatant were detected by kits while the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation was determined by 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) kit. Immunocytochemistry analysis was designed to determine transforming growth factor beta1(TGF-β1) protein expression while immunofluorescence analysis for RAGE and NF-kB. The protein expressions of TGF-β1, RAGE and NF-kB were analyzed by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: Pretreatment with GA at a concentration of 10(-8)-10(-6)M significantly reduced the AGEs-induced apoptosis in HUVECs. GA significantly increased antioxidant enzyme SOD activity and decreased peroxide degradation product MDA level in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, GA also remarkably inhibited the overgeneration of AGEs-induced ROS. Both immunocytochemistry analysis and western blot analysis showed that GA significantly decreased the protein expression of poinflammatory cytokine TGF-β1 in a similar manner which RAGE-Ab did. Additionally, AGEs-induced RAGE and NF-kB protein expressions were down-regulated significantly by the pretreatment with GA or RAGE-Ab. CONCLUSION: These findings provide evidences that GA possesses protective activity on AGEs-induced endothelial dysfunction, including anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammation and antioxidant stress, via inhibiting RAGE/NF-kB pathway. GA might be an alternative for the prevention and treatment of diabetic vascular complications in an appropriate dosage.
23529671	Evaluation of body weight, insulin resistance, leptin and adiponectin levels in premenopausal women with hyperprolactinemia. The effects of hyperprolactinemia on metabolic parameters are not clear and a few data evaluating adiponectin levels in prolactinoma and idiopathic hyperprolactinemia exist. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of hyperprolactinemia on body weight, insulin resistance, beta cell function, and leptin and adiponectin levels in premenopausal women with hyperprolactinemia. Forty premenopausal women with prolactinoma or idiopathic hyperprolactinemia were compared to 41 age-matched healthy premenopausal women with regard to body weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, waist to hip ratio, fasting plasma glucose, insulin levels, insulin resistance measured by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)-insulin resistance index, beta cell function measured by HOMA-β index, leptin and adiponectin levels. Plasma insulin levels and HOMA indexes (both insulin resistance and beta indexes) were significantly higher in hyperprolactinemic women. The other parameters were similar between both groups. There was a positive correlation between prolactin levels and fasting plasma glucose in hyperprolactinemic women. The results of this study showed that high prolactin levels may be associated with hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in premenopausal women. This effect seems to be independent of body weight, leptin and adiponectin levels. High prolactin levels may directly stimulate insulin secretion from pancreas and directly cause hepatic and whole-body insulin resistance.
23529825	CHEMICALNOTIN: a review of its use in chronic weight management. Oral CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN(®)), a selective CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN receptor agonist, is indicated in the US as an adjunct to diet and exercise in the chronic weight management of obese adults, or overweight adults with at least one weight-related comorbidity (e.g. dyslipidaemia, hypertension, type 2 diabetes). This article reviews the pharmacological properties, therapeutic efficacy and tolerability of oral CHEMICALNOTIN in this patient population. In three large randomized, double-blind, multicentre studies, oral CHEMICALNOTIN was more effective than placebo in the management of obese and overweight adults with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus. Following 12 months' therapy, significantly higher proportions of CHEMICALNOTIN than placebo recipients achieved a ≥5 and ≥10 % reduction from baseline in their bodyweight and a significant between-group difference favouring CHEMICALNOTIN over placebo was observed for the change from baseline in bodyweight. Moreover, among patients who had achieved a ≥5 % reduction in their bodyweight after 12 months' therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN, a significantly higher proportion who received CHEMICALNOTIN for a further 12 months than those who switched to placebo maintained ≥5 % weight loss at 24 months. In general, oral CHEMICALNOTIN was well tolerated in clinical studies, with hypoglycaemia and headache the most frequently reported adverse events in those with or without type 2 diabetes, respectively. According to a pooled analysis, the risk of US-FDA-defined valvulopathy with CHEMICALNOTIN is generally low and not statistically significantly different from placebo. From these and other data, the FDA has concluded that CHEMICALNOTIN is unlikely to elevate the risk of valvulopathy.
23530834	Design, Synthesis, Biological Evaluation, and Docking Studies of CHEMICALIN Derivatives with a CHEMICALIN Moiety as Potent GENEIN Inhibitors. A novel series of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives with a CHEMICALNOTIN moiety were designed and synthesized through a rational drug design strategy. Biological evaluation revealed that most tested compounds were potent GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, among them, the CHEMICALIN derivative 11h displayed the most potent GENEIN inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 0.247 μM. In addition, molecular docking analysis of the representative compounds 11h, 11k, and 15a were performed, which not only revealed the impact of binding modes on GENENOTIN inhibitory activity, but also provided additional methodological values for design and optimization. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.
23532932	Bioimaging real-time GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN gene regulation in GENENOTIN.fLUC reporter mice. The GENENOTIN gene encodes GENENOTIN a GENENOTIN that confers multidrug resistance in cancer cells and affects drug pharmacokinetics by virtue of its expression in the liver, kidney, and colon. GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are possible master regulators of xenobiotic-inducible GENENOTIN expression in drug processing organs, but the mechanism of GENENOTIN regulation has yet to be directly demonstrated in vivo. Moreover, it has previously been impossible to determine the sustained or cumulative effect of repeated doses of xenobiotics on in vivo GENENOTIN expression. We previously reported a mouse model containing firefly luciferase (fLUC) knocked into the GENENOTIN genomic locus, allowing non-invasive bioimaging of intestinal GENENOTIN gene expression in live animals. In the current study, we crossed GENENOTIN.fLUC mice into the GENENOTIN knockout (GENENOTIN(-/-)) genetic background and injected mice with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a strong GENEIN ligand, and two therapeutically relevant CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. All three agents induced GENEIN.fLUC expression (bioluminescence), but only CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN appeared to act primarily via GENEIN. Luminescence returned to baseline by 24-48 hrs after drug injection and was re-inducible over two additional rounds of drug dosing in GENENOTIN(+/+) mice. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN ligand, modestly induced GENEIN.fLUC in GENENOTIN(+/+) and GENENOTIN(-/-) strains, consistent with GENEIN's minor role in GENEIN regulation. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the GENENOTIN.fLUC bioimaging model can capture changes in GENENOTIN gene expression under conditions of repeated xenobiotic treatment in vivo and that it can be used to probe the mechanism of gene regulation in response to different xenobiotic agents.
23534440	Bioinformatics and Molecular Dynamics Simulation Study of L1 Stalk Non-Canonical rRNA Elements: Kink-Turns, Loops, and Tetraloops. The L1 stalk is a prominent mobile element of the large ribosomal subunit. We explore the structure and dynamics of its non-canonical rRNA elements, which include two kink-turns, an internal loop, and a tetraloop. We use bioinformatics to identify the L1 stalk RNA conservation patterns and carry out over 11.5 μs of MD simulations for a set of systems ranging from isolated RNA building blocks up to complexes of L1 stalk rRNA with the L1 protein and tRNA fragment. We show that the L1 stalk tetraloop has an unusual GNNA or UNNG conservation pattern deviating from major GNRA and YNMG RNA tetraloop families. We suggest that this deviation is related to a highly conserved tertiary contact within the L1 stalk. The available X-ray structures contain only UCCG tetraloops which in addition differ in orientation (anti vs syn) of the guanine. Our analysis suggests that the anti orientation might be a mis-refinement, although even the anti interaction would be compatible with the sequence pattern and observed tertiary interaction. Alternatively, the anti conformation may be a real substate whose population could be pH-dependent, since the guanine syn orientation requires protonation of cytosine in the tertiary contact. In absence of structural data, we use molecular modeling to explore the GCCA tetraloop that is dominant in bacteria and suggest that the GCCA tetraloop is structurally similar to the YNMG tetraloop. Kink-turn Kt-77 is unusual due to its 11-nucleotide bulge. The simulations indicate that the long bulge is a stalk-specific eight-nucleotide insertion into consensual kink-turn only subtly modifying its structural dynamics. We discuss a possible evolutionary role of helix H78 and a mechanism of L1 stalk interaction with tRNA. We also assess the simulation methodology. The simulations provide a good description of the studied systems with the latest bsc0χOL3 force field showing improved performance. Still, even bsc0χOL3 is unable to fully stabilize an essential sugar-edge H-bond between the bulge and non-canonical stem of the kink-turn. Inclusion of Mg(2+) ions may deteriorate the simulations. On the other hand, monovalent ions can in simulations readily occupy experimental Mg(2+) binding sites.
23535185	CHEMICALNOTIN attenuates mast cell-mediated allergic inflammation. A great number of people are suffering from allergic inflammatory disease such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, and sinusitis. Therefore discovery of drugs for the treatment of these diseases is an important subject in human health. In this study, we investigated anti-allergic inflammatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and underlying mechanisms of action using in vitro and in vivo models. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN release by the reduction of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN plus CHEMICALNOTIN ionophore A23187-stimulated human mast cells (HMC-1). CHEMICALIN decreased expression of pro-inflammatory GENEIN, such as GENEIN, GENEIN GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on theses pro-inflammatory GENEIN was related with GENEIN GENEIN, and GENEIN GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN attenuated GENEIN-mediated passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and the expression of GENEIN at the inflamed tissue. The inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN, a known anti-allergic drug. Our results showed that CHEMICALIN down-regulates mast cell-derived allergic inflammatory reactions by blocking CHEMICALNOTIN release and expression of pro-inflammatory GENEIN. In light of in vitro and in vivo anti-allergic inflammatory effects, CHEMICALNOTIN could be a beneficial anti-allergic inflammatory agent.
23535288	Aberrant activation of GENENOTIN by cell proliferation-evoking carcinogens after 28-day administration in rats. We have previously reported that hepatocarcinogens increase liver cells expressing GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN), a G1 checkpoint protein and GENENOTIN after 28-day treatment in rats. This study aimed to identify early prediction markers of carcinogens available in many target organs after 28-day treatment in rats. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed on GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN [nuclear GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)] with carcinogens targeting different organs. Carcinogens targeting thyroid (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN), urinary bladder (CHEMICALNOTIN), forestomach (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN), glandular stomach (CHEMICALNOTIN; CC), and colon (CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) were examined using a non-carcinogenic toxicant (CHEMICALNOTIN) and carcinogens targeting other organs as negative controls. All carcinogens increased GENENOTIN(+), nuclear GENENOTIN(+), GENENOTIN(+) or GENENOTIN(+) carcinogenic target cells, except for both colon carcinogens, which did not increase cell proliferation. On the other hand, GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN+) cells increased with SDM and CC. GENEIN responded only to CHEMICALIN. Results revealed carcinogens evoking cell proliferation concurrently induced cell cycle arrest at M phase or showing chromosomal instability reflecting aberration in cell cycle regulation, irrespective of target organs, after 28-day treatment. Therefore, GENENOTIN may be early prediction markers of carcinogens evoking cell proliferation in many target organs.
23537747	CHEMICALIN attenuates metastasis via both GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN pathways in GENENOTIN-treated liver cancer HepG2 cells. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and its receptor, GENENOTIN activation has recently been shown to play important roles in cancer invasion and metastasis in a wide variety of tumor cells. We use GENENOTIN as an invasive inducer of human HepG2 cells to investigate the effect of four flavones including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-mediated tumor invasion and metastasis. Among them, CHEMICALIN markedly inhibited GENEIN-induced the abilities of the adhesion, invasion, and migration by cell-matrix adhesion assay and transwell-chamber invasion/migration assay under non-cytotoxic concentrations. Data also showed CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-induced cell scattering and cytoskeleton changed such as filopodia and lamellipodia. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN could inhibit GENEIN-induced the membrane localization of phosphorylated GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, but not GENENOTIN and GENEIN. Next, CHEMICALIN significantly decreased the levels of GENEIN and GENEIN in GENEIN or GENEIN siRNA-transfected cells concomitantly with a marked reduction on cell invasion and migration. In conclusion, CHEMICALIN attenuates GENEIN-induced HepG2 cells metastasis involving both GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN pathways and are potentially useful as anti-metastatic agents for the treatment of hepatoma.
23539511	Cardiac natriuretic Peptide gene expression and plasma concentrations during the first 72 hours of life in piglets. Plasma measurement of cardiac natriuretic peptides constitutes promising markers of congenital heart disease. However, concentrations change rapidly and dramatically during the first days after delivery even in healthy neonates, which complicates clinical interpretation. It is unknown whether these changes in plasma concentrations are explained by corresponding changes in the cardiac gene expression. We quantified the chamber-specific mRNA levels of ANP (A-type natriuretic peptide) and BNP (B-type natriuretic peptide) and plasma pro-ANP and BNP-32 concentrations in healthy piglets during the first 72 hours of life (from 2 litters, n = 44). Chamber-specific ANP and BNP mRNA levels reflected hemodynamic neonate changes at birth but did not correlate with circulating natriuretic peptide concentrations. However, plasma pro-ANP and creatinine concentrations were closely correlated (P < .0001; r = 0.73). Plasma pro-ANP levels were highest on the day of delivery (5580 pmol/L [4320-6786] decreasing to 2484 pmol/L [1602-2898] after 72 hours, P < .0001). During the 72 hours, gel chromatography suggested that the translational products in circulation and in atrial tissue were immature, ie, unprocessed pro-ANP. In contrast to pro-ANP, BNP-32 plasma concentrations were low at delivery and peaked after 48 hours (12 [10.5-20.6] vs. 88.8 [71.7-101.4] pmol/L, P < .0001). To conclude, ANP and BNP gene expression differs considerably between cardiac chambers in the first 72 hours of life in healthy piglets, resembling the transition from fetal to neonate circulation. However, the cardiac gene expression does not explain plasma concentrations.
23541086	T-Cells from GENENOTIN+ Human Subjects Are Activated with CHEMICALNOTIN through Two Independent Pathways and Induce Cell Death by Multiple Mechanisms. Susceptibility to abacavir hypersensitivity has been attributed to possession of the specific GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN-restricted activation of CD8+ T-cells provides a link between the genetic association and the iatrogenic disease. The objectives of this study were to characterize the functionality of drug-responsive CD8+ T-cell clones generated from GENENOTIN+ drug-naive subjects and to explore the relationship between CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation in antigen presenting cells and the T-cell response. Seventy-four CD8+ clones expressing different GENEIN were shown to proliferate and kill target cells via different mechanisms when exposed to CHEMICALIN. Certain clones were activated with CHEMICALNOTIN in the absence of antigen presenting cells. Analysis of the remaining clones revealed two pathways of drug-dependent T-cell activation. Overnight incubation of antigen presenting cells with CHEMICALNOTIN, followed by repeated washing to remove soluble drug, activated approximately 50% of the clones, and the response was blocked by CHEMICALNOTIN fixation. In contrast, a 1 h antigen presenting cell pulse did not activate any of the clones. Accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN in antigen presenting cells was rapid (less than 1 h), and the intracellular concentrations were maintained for 16 h. However, intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN was not detectable by mass spectrometry after pulsing. These data suggest that T-cells can be activated by CHEMICALIN through a direct interaction with surface and intracellular GENEIN (GENEIN) molecules. With the former, CHEMICALIN seemingly participates in the GENEIN GENEIN binding interaction. In contrast, the latter pathway likely involves GENEIN binding peptides displayed as a consequence of CHEMICALIN exposure, but not CHEMICALIN itself.
23541982	Potential diagnostic applications of side chain CHEMICALNOTIN analysis in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The neurospecific CHEMICALNOTIN 24-hydroxylase converts excess brain CHEMICALNOTIN into CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) which, via the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), can increase the expression and synthesis of astrocyte GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN effluxes directly from brain into plasma where it is considered an indicator of brain CHEMICALNOTIN turnover. It is reduced in neurodegenerative disease states proportionally to the severity of disease and the degree of brain atrophy. In the early phases of active disease, a higher rate of turnover may result in transitory increases in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN. Less than 1% of the total brain excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN occurs via the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) whereas almost all CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) excretion is dependent on the function of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Iincreased CSF CHEMICALNOTIN were found in patients with neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory diseases in the presence of barrier dysfunction. In neurodegeneration, free CHEMICALNOTIN released from dying cells may engulf neurons. CHEMICALIN also increases GENEIN (GENEIN) deposition and GENEIN pathology. GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were correlated in Alzheimer disease (AD) samples. Excess of CHEMICALIN converted into CHEMICALIN may up-regulate GENEIN synthesis which is a scavenger for GENEIN and GENEIN. In AD this protective mechanism seems to be inefficient, probably due to the presence of high concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN, microvascular dysfunction and the decreased efficiency of GENENOTIN as lipid transporter and GENENOTIN scavenger. CHEMICALNOTIN itself was cytotoxic. Analysis of side chain CHEMICALNOTIN in the CSF is likely to provided useful information about CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism and GENENOTIN function in the pathogenesis of AD.
23543737	Loss of GENENOTIN Activity in Cortical Astrocytes Decreases CHEMICALNOTIN Uptake and Induces Neurotoxic Release of CHEMICALNOTIN. The extent of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inactivation in the brain following ischemia correlates with the extent of damage. We have previously shown that a loss of GENENOTIN activity in neurons is detrimental to neuronal viability by inducing excitotoxic CHEMICALNOTIN release. In the current study, we extend these findings to show that the ability of astrocytes to buffer extracellular CHEMICALIN is reduced when GENEIN is inhibited. Furthermore, GENENOTIN inhibition in astrocytes is associated with the rapid onset of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN oscillations. Surprisingly, this rapid CHEMICALNOTIN influx is blocked by the GENENOTIN antagonist, GENENOTIN. While the function of GENEIN within astrocytes is controversial, these GENEIN have been linked to CHEMICALIN-dependent vesicular gliotransmitter release. When extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels are measured following GENENOTIN inhibition within our enriched astrocyte cultures, no alterations in CHEMICALNOTIN levels are observed, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN levels in the extracellular environment significantly increase. Extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation associated with GENENOTIN inhibition contributes both to CHEMICALNOTIN oscillations within astrocytes and ultimately cortical neuron toxicity. Thus, a loss of GENENOTIN signaling within astrocytes dysregulates CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and supports CHEMICALNOTIN release, two processes that would compromise neuronal survival following ischemic/excitotoxic insults.
23545568	Stable and high-rate overcharge protection for rechargeable lithium batteries. Rechargeable lithium or lithium-ion cells can be overcharge-protected by an electroactive polymer composite separator. The use of non-woven fibrous membranes instead of conventional microporous membranes as the composite substrates allowed better distribution of the electroactive polymer, which led to improved utilization and a 40-fold increase in sustainable current density. For the first time, stable overcharge protection for hundreds of cycles was demonstrated in several cell chemistries, including LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2, LiFePO4, and spinel Li1.05Mn1.95O4 half-cells. Protection at a charging rate as high as 5 C was achieved at a steady state cell potential below 4.85 V.
23547652	CHEMICALIN as Novel CHEMICALIN Binding Group for Selective GENEIN Inhibition. Small molecules bearing hydroxamic acid as the CHEMICALIN binding group (ZBG) have been the most effective GENEIN inhibitors (GENEINi) to date. However, concerns about the pharmacokinetic liabilities of the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety have stimulated research efforts aimed at finding alternative nonhydroxamate ZBGs. We have identified CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) as a novel ZBG that is compatible with GENEIN inhibition. CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN and GENEIN with an IC50 of 681 and 3675 nM, respectively. Remarkably, CHEMICALIN gives no inhibition of GENEIN. Subsequent optimization led to several novel CHEMICALIN-based GENEINi that are selective for GENEIN and GENEIN. Furthermore, a subset of these inhibitors induces apoptosis in various cancer cell lines.
23552260	Histological, ultrastructural and immunohistochemical studies on the protective effect of ginger extract against cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in male rats. Cisplatin (CP) is a widely used anticancer drug; however, it has several side effects such as nephrotoxicity. Ginger, the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, consumed since ancient times has numerous health benefits. The objective of this work was to evaluate the protective effect of ginger extract (GE) against CP-induced nephrotoxicity. CP group displayed a marked renal failure characterized by a significant increase in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) levels in addition to severe histopathological and ultrastructural renal alterations. Also, CP group showed an increase in the immunohistochemical expression of Bax proapoptotic protein. In contrast, GE+CP group showed significant decrease in the elevated serum creatinine and BUN levels and an improvement in the histopathological and ultrastructural renal injury induced by CP. The overexpression of Bax proapoptotic protein was significantly decreased in the GE+CP group. Hence, the present results indicated that GE has a protective effect against CP-induced renal damage in rats. Thereby, such findings recommended the usage of GE to prevent and/or decrease the renal damage induced by CP chemotherapeutic treatment.
23553905	An analysis of skeletal development in osteoblast- and chondrocyte-specific Runx2 knockout mice. Global gene deletion studies in mice and humans have established the pivotal role of runt related transcription factor-2 (Runx2) in both intramembranous and endochondral ossification processes during skeletogenesis. In this study, we for the first time generated mice carrying a conditional Runx2 allele with exon 4, which encodes the Runt domain, flanked by loxP sites. These mice were crossed with α1(I)-collagen-Cre or α1(II)-collagen-Cre transgenic mice to obtain osteoblast- or chondrocyte-specific Runx2 deficient mice, respectively. As seen in Runx2(-/-) mice, perinatal lethality was observed in α1(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, but this was not the case in animals in which α1(I)-collagen-Cre was used to delete Runx2. When using double staining with Alizarin red for mineralized matrix and Alcian blue for cartilaginous matrix, we observed previously that mineralization was totally absent at embryonic day 15.5 throughout the body in Runx2(-/-) mice, but was found in areas undergoing intramembranous ossification such as skull and clavicles in α1(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice. In newborn α1(II)-Cre;Runx2(flox/flox) mice, mineralization impairment was restricted to skeletal areas undergoing endochondral ossification including long bones and vertebrae. In contrast, no apparent skeletal abnormalities were seen in mutant embryo, newborn, and 3- to 6-week old-mice in which Runx2 had been deleted with the α1(I)-collagen-Cre driver. These results suggest that Runx2 is absolutely required for endochondral ossification during embryonic and postnatal skeletogenesis, but that disrupting its expression in already committed osteoblasts as achieved here with the α1(I)-collagen-Cre driver does not affect overtly intramembranous and endochondral ossification. The Runx2 floxed allele established here is undoubtedly useful for investigating the role of Runx2 in particular cells. © 2013 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.
23554071	A Mineral Extract from red Algae Ameliorates Chronic Spontaneous Colitis in IL-10 Deficient Mice in a Mouse Strain Dependent Manner. Inflammatory bowel disease is an urgent public health problem with a high incidence in developed countries. Alterations of lifestyle or dietary interventions may attenuate the disease progression and increase the efficacy of current therapies. Here we tested the effect of chronic supplementation with a mineral extract from red marine algae - rich in calcium (34%), magnesium, phosphorus, selenium and other trace minerals - in a clinically relevant model of spontaneous enterocolitis, interleukin (IL)-10(-/-) mice. The mineral extract was administered in the drinking water of Il10(-/-) mice on C57BL/6 J and BALB/c strain backgrounds for 25 weeks commencing from 3 to 4 weeks of age. The mineral extract ameliorated the spontaneous development of colitis and severity of disease in Il10(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 J background. Mineral extract-treated Il10(-/-) C57BL/6 J strain mice had significantly reduced mortality, circulating levels of serum Amyloid A and reduced colonic tissue damage. In contrast, comparable treatment of Il10(-/-) mice on a BALB/c background with the mineral extract did not alter the course of colitis. These data demonstrate that chronic supplementation with a natural mineral extract selectively ameliorates spontaneous mild-moderate colitis in Il10(-/-) mice on a C57BL/6 J, but does not attenuate more moderate-severe colitis in BALB/c strain animals.

23554574	Neuronal expression of glucosylceramide synthase in central nervous system regulates body weight and energy homeostasis. Hypothalamic neurons are main regulators of energy homeostasis. Neuronal function essentially depends on plasma membrane-located gangliosides. The present work demonstrates that hypothalamic integration of metabolic signals requires neuronal expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS; UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase). As a major mechanism of central nervous system (CNS) metabolic control, we demonstrate that GCS-derived gangliosides interacting with leptin receptors (ObR) in the neuronal membrane modulate leptin-stimulated formation of signaling metabolites in hypothalamic neurons. Furthermore, ganglioside-depleted hypothalamic neurons fail to adapt their activity (c-Fos) in response to alterations in peripheral energy signals. Consequently, mice with inducible forebrain neuron-specific deletion of the UDP-glucose:ceramide glucosyltransferase gene (Ugcg) display obesity, hypothermia, and lower sympathetic activity. Recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated Ugcg delivery to the arcuate nucleus (Arc) significantly ameliorated obesity, specifying gangliosides as seminal components for hypothalamic regulation of body energy homeostasis.
23557688	Environmental pesticide exposure modulates cytokines, arginase and ornithine decarboxylase expression in human placenta. To evaluate the cytokine balance and enzymatic alterations induced by environmental pesticide exposure during pregnancy, this transversal study explored placentas derived from non-exposed women (control group-CG), and from women living in a rural area (rural group-RG), collected during intensive organophosphate (OP) pesticide spraying season (RG-SS) and during non-spraying season (RG-NSS). The exposure biomarkers blood cholinesterase and placental carboxylesterase (CaE) were significantly decreased in RG-SS. Among the cytokines studied IL-8, IL-6, TNFα, IL-10, TGFβ and IL-13, the expression frequency of IL-13 increased in RG-SS. Arginase and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) enzymes were induced in syncytiotrophoblast and endothelial cells. Interestingly, the decrease in CaE activity was associated with arginase and ODC activity induction. These findings suggest that environmental pesticide exposure impacts the placenta by increasing the expression frequency of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-13, which may be related to the up-regulation of enzymes implicated in tissue repair.
23558600	Lixisenatide: first global approval. The selective once-daily prandial GENENOTIN agonist lixisenatide (Lyxumia(®)) is under development with Sanofi for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Lixisenatide belongs to a class of GENENOTIN compounds designed to mimic the endogenous hormone GENENOTIN. Native GENENOTIN stimulates GENEIN secretion in a CHEMICALIN-dependent manner, as well as suppressing GENENOTIN production and slowing gastric emptying. A once-daily subcutaneous formulation of lixisenatide has been approved in the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Mexico for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, and is under regulatory review in the USA, Switzerland, Brazil, Canada, Ukraine, South Africa, Japan and Australia. This article summarizes the milestones in the development of lixisenatide, leading to this first approval for use in adults with type 2 diabetes.
23561088	Maqui berry (Aristotelia chilensis) and the constituent CHEMICALIN inhibit GENEIN cell death induced by visible light. The protective effects of maqui berry (Aristotelia chilensis) extract (MBE) and its major CHEMICALNOTIN [CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)] against light-induced murine photoreceptor cells (661W) death were evaluated. Viability of 661W after light treatment for 24h, assessed by the CHEMICALNOTIN salt (WST-8) assay and CHEMICALNOTIN nuclear staining, was improved by addition of MBE, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Intracellular radical activation in 661W, evaluated using the reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS)-sensitive probe CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), was reduced by MBE and its CHEMICALNOTIN. The anti-apoptosis mechanism of MBE was evaluated by light-induced phosphorylation of GENENOTIN. MBE significantly suppressed the light-induced phosphorylation of GENENOTIN. These findings indicate that MBE and its CHEMICALIN suppress the light-induced photoreceptor cell death by inhibiting ROS production, suggesting that the inhibition of GENEIN may be involved in the underlying mechanism.
23561115	Influence of triterpenoids present in apple peel on inflammatory gene expression associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Various ursanic, oleanic and lupanic pentacyclic triterpenoids found in apple peel were studied for anti-inflammatory effects in vitro using T84 colon carcinoma cells. After pretreatment with single triterpenoids, cells were stimulated with pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, INF-γ, IL-1β). Regulation of mRNA expression was analysed for three specific inflammation-associated marker genes (TNF-α, IL-8, IP-10) using qRT-PCR. Furthermore, the effects of ursolic acid (UA) and oleanolic acid (OA) on the synthesis of certain pro-inflammatory proteins were examined. IP-10 expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by all the tested compounds at concentrations ⩾25μM. The mRNA expression of TNF-α was slightly affected and the IL-8 level was increased. At the protein level, UA and OA (25μM) reduced the synthesis of IP-10; sICAM-1, IL-23 and GROα were slightly repressed. The TNF-α level was not modulated, whereas induction of IL-8 was increased. UA also enhanced the synthesis of IL-1ra, while OA suppressed the level of I-TAC. The present study confirms that triterpenoids present in apple peel and β-damascone may be implicated in the anti-inflammatory properties of apple constituents, suggesting that these substances might be helpful in the treatment of IBD as nutrient supplements.
23561205	CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits invasion and metastasis in K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells. CHEMICALNOTIN, the active constituent of dietary spice turmeric, possesses a strong potential for cancer prevention and treatment. However, there is no study to address the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on invasion and metastasis of thyroid cancers. Thyroid cancer is the most common malignancy of endocrine organs, and its incidence rates have steadily increased over recent decades. Although most indolent tumours can be effectively managed, metastatic tumours at distant secondary sites behave aggressively and currently there is no effective form of treatment. Here, for the first time it has been reported that CHEMICALNOTIN inhibit multiple metastasis steps of K1 papillary thyroid cancer cells. CHEMICALNOTIN dose-dependently suppressed viability of K1 cells as well as its cell attachment, spreading, migration and invasion abilities. Moreover, CHEMICALIN could also down-regulate the expression and activity of GENEIN (GENEIN). The findings showed that CHEMICALNOTIN might be an effective tumouristatic agent for the treatment of aggressive papillary thyroid carcinomas.
23562365	CHEMICALNOTIN extracted from Vitex negundo possess cytotoxic activity by G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction. CHEMICALNOTIN is a CHEMICALNOTIN compounds mixture extracted from Vitex negundo, a widely used herb in traditional Chinese medicine. This study is aimed to define the spectrum of cytotoxic activity of CHEMICALNOTIN, and also to investigate mechanisms underlying the anticancer actions via assessing the influence on cell cycle using CHEMICALNOTIN, and the CHEMICALNOTIN compound CHEMICALNOTIN purified from CHEMICALNOTIN. The cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was determined with SRB assay using a panel of cancer cell lines. Breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-435 and liver cancer cell line SMMC-7721 were selected for further evaluating the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN on cell cycle by flow cytometric analysis. Apoptosis exerted by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN was measured by TUNEL assay and DAPI staining, and Western blot analysis was utilized to assess the influence on expression and phosphorylation of proteins which are closely related to cell cycle and apoptosis. CHEMICALNOTIN possessed a broad spectrum of in vitro anticancer activity for those tested cancer cells, especially sensitive to MDA-MB-435, SKOV-3, BXPC-3, SMMC-7721, MCF-7, HO-8910, SGC-7901, BEL-7402, HCT-116, and 786-O, with the respective IC50 below 10μg/ml. Treatment with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN resulted in arresting the MDA-MB-435 and SMMC-7721 cells at G2/M phase, which was further supported by observations of increased phosphorylation of GENEIN at CHEMICALIN10, phosphorylation of GENEIN at CHEMICALIN15, expression of GENEIN, and decreased expression of GENEIN. Moreover, we found that exposure of MDA-MB-435 cells to CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN caused obvious apoptosis of MDA-MB-435 cells. Our data show that CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN compounds extracted from Vitex negundo, possesses a broad spectrum cytotoxic effect via arresting cancer cells at G2/M phase cell cycle and subsequently inducing apoptosis.
23562495	GENENOTIN mediate the antinociceptive effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. Background CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a CHEMICALNOTIN product of the secondary metabolism of plants, has been shown in the literature to possess several different biological activities. However, no antinociceptive abilities have yet been discussed. Here, we used acute pain animal models to describe the antinociceptive action of CHEMICALNOTIN. Methods The CHEMICALNOTIN-induced writhing test and the paw-licking test, in which paw licking was induced by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, were performed to evaluate the antinociceptive action of CHEMICALNOTIN and to determine the involvement of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in its antinociceptive mechanism. To do so, we induced paw-linking using agonists. Results CHEMICALNOTIN was administered intragastrically (25, 50, 75, 100 and 200mg/kg), and the two higher doses caused antinociceptive effects in the CHEMICALNOTIN model; the highest dose reduced pain for 4h after it was administered (200mg/kg). In the CHEMICALNOTIN test, two doses of CHEMICALNOTIN promoted antinociception in both the early and later phases of the test. The CHEMICALNOTIN test showed that its receptors are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN. Pretreatment with CHEMICALNOTIN did not alter locomotor activity or motor coordination. In an investigation into the participation of GENEIN and GENEIN in CHEMICALIN's antinociceptive mechanism, we used CHEMICALIN (2.2μg/paw), CHEMICALIN (10mmol/paw), CHEMICALIN (1.2mmol/paw) and acidified saline (2% CHEMICALIN, pH 1.98). The results showed that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, but not GENENOTIN, are involved in the antinociceptive mechanism. Finally, the involvement of GENEIN and GENEIN was also studied, and we showed that both play a role in the antinociceptive mechanism of CHEMICALIN. Conclusion The results of this work contribute information regarding the antinociceptive properties of CHEMICALNOTIN on acute pain and show that, at least in part, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN participate in CHEMICALIN's antinociceptive mechanism.
23562496	CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibit invasion of triple negative breast cancer cells. Breast cancer is estimated as one of the most common causes of cancer death among women. In particular, triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs), which do not express the genes for CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), have been associated with poor prognosis and metastasis. CHEMICALNOTIN, the biosynthetic precursors of CHEMICALNOTIN present in edible plants, exert cytotoxic and chemopreventive activities. Although mounting evidence suggests the anticancer properties of CHEMICALNOTIN, limited information is available regarding the inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the aggressiveness of breast cancer cells. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and its derivatives on the growth and the invasiveness of TNBC cells. Here, we showed that treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN for 24h inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231cells with IC50 values of 18.1, 4.6, and 6.7μM, respectively. Similarly, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN also exerted cytotoxicity in another TNBC cell line, Hs578T. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN did not show the cytotoxicity on the MDA-MB-231cells. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN induced apoptosis by GENEIN downregulation. Importantly, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN exerted more potent inhibitory effects on the proliferation, GENEIN expression and invasive phenotype of MDA-MB-231 than CHEMICALIN. These results suggest a potential application of these CHEMICALNOTIN as anticancer agents that can alleviate malignant progression of TNBC.
23566269	CHEMICALIN Derivatives as Novel GENEIN Inhibitors. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyzes the oxidation of CHEMICALIN including CHEMICALIN, a coagonist of the GENEIN. We identified a series of CHEMICALIN derivatives as novel GENEIN inhibitors with high potency and substantial cell permeability using fragment-based drug design. Comparisons of complex structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank as well as those determined with in-house fragment hits revealed that a hydrophobic subpocket was formed perpendicular to the flavin ring by flipping CHEMICALNOTIN224 in a ligand-dependent manner. We investigated the ability of the initial fragment hit, CHEMICALNOTIN, to fill this subpocket with the aid of complex structure information. CHEMICALIN exhibited the predicted binding mode and demonstrated high inhibitory activity for GENEIN in enzyme- and cell-based assays. We further designed and synthesized CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives, which are equivalent to the CHEMICALNOTIN series but lack cell toxicity. CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be effective against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cognitive deficit in the Y-maze.
23567241	Comparative study on transcriptional activity of 17 CHEMICALIN mediated by GENENOTIN and GENEIN. The structure-activity relationships of CHEMICALNOTIN which are widely used as preservatives for transcriptional activities mediated by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were investigated. Fourteen of 17 CHEMICALIN exhibited GENEIN and/or GENEIN agonistic activity at concentrations of ⩽1×10(-5)M, whereas none of the 17 CHEMICALIN showed GENEIN agonistic or antagonistic activity. Among 12 CHEMICALIN with linear CHEMICALIN chains ranging in length from C1 to C12, CHEMICALIN (C7) and CHEMICALIN (C5) showed the most potent GENEIN and GENEIN agonistic activity in the order of 10(-7)M and 10(-8)M, respectively, and the activities decreased in a stepwise manner as the alkyl chain was shortened to C1 or lengthened to C12. Most CHEMICALIN showing estrogenic activity exhibited GENEIN-agonistic activity at lower concentrations than those inducing GENEIN-agonistic activity. The estrogenic activity of CHEMICALNOTIN was markedly decreased by incubation with rat liver microsomes, and the decrease of activity was blocked by a GENENOTIN inhibitor. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN are selective agonists for GENEIN over GENEIN; their interactions with GENENOTIN are dependent on the size and bulkiness of the CHEMICALNOTIN groups; and they are metabolized by GENEIN, leading to attenuation of their estrogenic activity.
23567490	The cyclin D1 (CCND1) rs9344 G>A polymorphism predicts clinical outcome in colon cancer patients treated with adjuvant 5-FU-based chemotherapy. Recent evidence indicates a potential prognostic and predictive value for germline polymorphisms in genes involved in cell cycle control. We investigated the effect of cyclin D1 (CCND1) rs9344 G>A in stage II/III colon cancer patients and validated the findings in an independent study cohort. For evaluation and validation set, a total of 264 and 234 patients were included. Patients treated with 5-fluorouracil-based chemotherapy, carrying the CCND1 rs9344 A/A genotype had significantly decreased time-to-tumor recurrence (TTR) in univariate analysis and multivariate analysis (hazard ratio (HR) 2.47; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.16-5.29; P=0.019). There was no significant association between CCND1 rs9344 G>A and TTR in patients with curative surgery alone. In the validation set, the A allele of CCND1 rs9344 G>A remained significantly associated with decreased TTR in univariate and multivariate analyses (HR 1.94; 95% CI 1.05-3.58; P=0.035). CCND1 rs9344 G>A may be a predictive and/or prognostic biomarker in stage II/III colon cancer patients, however, prospective trials are warranted to confirm our findings.The Pharmacogenomics Journal advance online publication, 9 April 2013; doi:10.1038/tpj.2013.15.
23567861	Evaluation of 7-O-galloyl-d-sedoheptulose, isolated from Corni Fructus, in the adipose tissue of type 2 diabetic db/db mice. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of 7-O-galloyl-d-sedoheptulose (GS), isolated from Corni Fructus, using type 2 diabetic mice. GS was orally administered to db/db mice at doses of 20 and 100mg/kg body weight per day for 6weeks, and the effects of GS on biochemical factors in serum and adipose tissue were investigated. To define the underlying mechanism of these effects, protein expressions related to lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis, were measured. The results showed that levels of glucose, leptin, insulin, C-peptide, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, triglycerides, total cholesterol, non-esterified fatty acids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol/low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance (TBARS) in serum were down-regulated, while adiponectin was augmented by GS treatment. In addition, the elevated lipid, ROS, and TBARS contents in adipose tissue as well as serum levels in db/db mice were significantly decreased by the oral administration of GS. From protein analysis, the decreased expressions of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor (PPAR)α, PPARγ, and B-cell lymphoma 2 were up-regulated in the adipose tissue of db/db mice. The administration of GS significantly decreased sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, nuclear factor-kappa ?>Bp65, cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, monocyte chemotactic protein-1, intracellular adhesion molecule-1, phosphor c-Jun N-terminal kinase, activator protein-1, transforming growth factor-β1, Bax, cytochrome c, and caspase-3 expressions. These results suggest that GS acts as a regulator of oxidative stress, inflammation, fibrosis, and apoptosis in the adipose tissue of db/db mice.
23570615	Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinases (ERK) Inhibitors from Aristolochia yunnanensis. Six new sesquiterpenoids, aristoyunnolins A-F (1-6), an artifact of isolation [7-O-ethyl madolin W (7)], and 12 known analogues were isolated from stems of Aristolochia yunnanensis. The structures were determined by combined chemical and spectral methods, and the absolute configurations of compounds 2, 3, 5-7, 9, 14, and 17 were determined by the modified Mosher's method and CD analysis. Compounds 1-19 were screened using a bioassay system designed to evaluate the effect on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways. Among three MAPKs (ERK1/2, JNK, and p38), compounds 1, 4, 10-13, 16, 18, and 19 exhibited selective inhibition of the phosphorylation of ERK1/2. Compounds 16 and 19 were more active than the positive control PD98059, a known inhibitor of the ERK1/2 signaling pathway.
23570999	In vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory potential of CHEMICALNOTIN in rats. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a CHEMICALNOTIN was isolated from Wattakaka volubilis Linn. (Stap.f.). CHEMICALNOTIN was evaluated for in vivo and in vitro anti-inflammatory activity using acute inflammation and chronic model of inflammation in rats and LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. CHEMICALNOTIN seemed to be responsible for the anti-inflammatory activity in the studied models. CHEMICALNOTIN at dose level of both 5 and 10mg/kg significantly reduced the edema induced by the carrageenan in acute model of inflammation. It also showed significant anti-proliferative effect (dry pellet weight basis) in chronic model of inflammation. Cellular content of granuloma was measured by assaying activity of CHEMICALNOTIN glucosaminidase (NAG) and total nucleic acid content. CHEMICALNOTIN at 5 and 10mg/kg significantly suppressed the cellular infiltration measured by total nucleic acid content. In contrast, NAG activity decreased over a period of 10 days resulting in inhibition of granuloma weight gain. CHEMICALNOTIN had a more effective response than the reference drug CHEMICALNOTIN in both the models of inflammation. Wattakaka volubilis CHEMICALIN mixture (WVSM) and CHEMICALIN (1-50μM) significantly inhibited the GENEIN and GENEIN enzymes resulting in low levels of PGE2 and NO in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. Hence the study supports the traditional use of Wattakaka volubilis and its constituent CHEMICALNOTIN in treatment of inflammatory disorders.
23572389	Hypermethylation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN genes in ovarian cancer. Both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN proteins are inhibitors of GENENOTIN that prevent the cell going through the G1/S phase transaction. GENEIN is a transmembrane glycoprotein that mediates CHEMICALIN-dependent interactions between adjacent epithelial cells. Two groups of patients were selected: the first group suffered from epithelial serous ovarian tumors and the second group suffered from benign ovarian lesions; ovarian tissue samples from all the subjects (benign and malignant) were subjected to methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction for methylated and unmethylated alleles of the genes (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN). Results obtained showed that aberrant methylation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes were detected in 64.29 and 50% of ovarian cancer patients, while GENENOTIN hypermethylation was detected in 78.57% of ovarian cancer patients. Methylation of GENENOTIN was significantly correlated with different stage of disease (p < 0.05). It was found that the risk of GENENOTIN hypermethylation was 1.347-fold, while risk of GENENOTIN hypermethylation was 1.543-fold and p16 was 1.2-fold among patients with ovarian cancer than that among patients with benign ovarian lesions. In conclusion, Dysfunction of the cell cycle and/or the cell-cell adhesion molecule plays a role in the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer and that the analysis of the methylation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes can provide clinically important evidence on which to base the treatment.
23572405	Circulating glucagon to ghrelin ratio as a determinant of insulin resistance in hyperthyroidism. Due to stimulated overall metabolism, a state of nutritional inadequacy often ensues, during thyrotoxicosis. We aimed to investigate circulating levels of some major components of the system that regulates energy stores, glucose, and fat metabolism, during thyrotoxicosis compared to euthyroidism. Fasting serum ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, glucagon, glucose, as well as body fat composition were analyzed during thyrotoxicosis in 40 hyperthyroid patients (50.5 ± 15.2 years old, 22 females, 31 with Graves disease, and 9 with toxic nodular goiter). The same measurements were repeated an average 3 months later, when all patients achieved euthyroidism. Compared to euthyroidism, in thyrotoxicosis, patients had lower ghrelin and fat mass; had comparable insulin, HOMA-IR, glucagon, and leptin levels; higher levels of circulating adiponectin. Fasting serum glucose tended to be higher during thyrotoxicosis. The unique correlation of HOMA-IR was with the-glucagon to ghrelin ratio-(r = 0.801, p < 0.001) in hyperthyrodism, and with glucagon itself in euthyroidism (r = -0.844, p < 0.001). Circulating levels of ghrelin are decreased; leptin, insulin, glucagon are unchanged; adiponectin are increased during hyperthyroidism. The fasting HOMA-IR tends to be higher, despite the decreased adiposity in hyperthyroidism. The-glucagon to ghrelin ratio-strongly correlates with fasting HOMA-IR in hyperthyroidism.
23574729	Proposed diagnostic criteria for subclinical Cushing's syndrome associated with adrenal incidentaloma. Subclinical Cushing's syndrome (SCS) associated with adrenal incidentaloma is usually characterized by autonomous cortisol secretion without overt symptoms of Cushing's syndrome (CS). Although the diagnostic criteria for SCS differ among countries, the 1 mg dexamethasone suppression test (DST) is essential to confirm the presence and the extent of cortisol overproduction. Since 1995, SCS has been diagnosed in Japan based on serum cortisol levels ≥3 μg/dl (measured by radioimmunoassay [RIA]) after a 1 mg DST. However, the increasing use of enzyme immunoassays (EIA) instead of RIA has hindered the diagnosis of SCS because of the differing sensitivities of commercially available assays, particularly for serum cortisol levels of around 3 μg/dl. One way to overcome this problem is to lower the cortisol threshold level after a 1 mg DST. In the present study, we examined the clinical applicability of lowering the cortisol threshold to 1.8 μg/dl, similar to the American Endocrine Society's guidelines for CS, by reanalyzing 119 patients with adrenal incidentaloma. Our findings indicate that serum cortisol levels ≥1.8 μg/dl after 1 mg DST are useful to confirm the diagnosis of SCS if both of the following criteria are met: (1) basal ACTH level <10 pg/ml (or poor plasma ACTH response to corticotrophin-releasing hormone) and (2) serum cortisol ≥5 μg/dl at 21:00 to 23:00 h. If only one of (1) and (2) are met, we recommend that other clinical features are considered in the diagnosis of SCS, including serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels, urine free cortisol levels, adrenal scintigraphy, and clinical manifestation.
23577589	Flexibly timed once-daily dosing with degludec: a new ultra-long-acting basal insulin. Insulin treatment in type 1 and type 2 diabetes (T1D and T2D) is highly efficacious, but in practice, non-adherence and ineffective dose titration limit its effectiveness. Barriers to more effective insulin treatment are numerous, including hypoglycaemia, fear of hypoglycaemia and concern about weight gain. The regular treatment timing needed with conventional basal insulins [neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin and the first-generation analogues glargine and detemir] may also make adherence to these treatments problematic for many patients. Indeed, surveys indicate that the rigidity of this schedule induces some patients with T1D and T2D to omit insulin doses. Degludec is a novel, ultra-long-acting basal insulin analogue that is as effective as insulin glargine, but significantly reduces patients' risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Because of its peakless, extended and highly predictable glucose-lowering effect, once-daily dosing on a flexible schedule may be feasible with degludec. Studies testing this possibility suggest that degludec tolerates day-to-day variation in dose timing while maintaining full efficacy and low risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Degludec would appear to be an appropriate choice for patients being considered for a basal analogue, and it may be particularly well suited to patients with unpredictable social or work schedules, those who travel frequently and those who find rigid scheduling of their insulin injections a burden or barrier to regular treatment.
23578968	Evaluation of a predictive in vitro Leydig cell assay for anti-androgenicity of phthalate esters in the rat. An in vitro assay using the rat Leydig cell line R2C was evaluated for its ability to quantitatively predict inhibition of testosterone synthesis. Results obtained for endocrine active phthalates (MEHP, MBP), and inactive phthalates (MMP and MEP) were highly consistent with in vivo results based on tissue and media concentrations. Statistically significant inhibition of testosterone synthesis (p<0.05, 1-way ANOVA) was observed at 1μM MBP and 3μM MEHP, while MEP and MMP did not affect inhibition of testosterone synthesis until much higher concentrations (≫100μM). Concentrations causing 50% inhibition of testosterone synthesis for MBP and MEHP (3 and 6μM respectively), were similar to in vivo values (3 and 7μM). The R2C assay was used to determine the relative potency of 14 structurally diverse monoesters and oxidative metabolites of MEHP. Monoesters with alkyl chains 4-5 carbons in length had the highest potency for testosterone inhibition, while 0-2 carbon alkyl chains were least potent. Phase I metabolism did not completely inactivate MEHP, underscoring the need for metabolism data when interpreting in vitro pharmacodynamic data. This steroid inhibition assay provides a predictive in vitro alternative to expensive and timeconsuming developmental rat studies for phthalate-induced antiandrogenicity.
23583009	CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN hepatotoxicity via depleting heme pool and releasing CHEMICALNOTIN. Naturally occuring CHEMICALNOTIN protects hepatocytes from CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative stress, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) induction and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) metabolite may be implicated in the beneficial effect. However, the precise mechanism by which CHEMICALIN counteracts GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN hepatotoxicity through GENEIN system is still remained unclear. To explore the potential mechanism, herein, CHEMICALNOTIN (4.0g/kg.bw.) was administrated to rats for 90 days. Our data showed that chronic CHEMICALIN over-activated GENEIN but suppressed GENEIN with concurrent hepatic oxidative damage, which was partially normalized by CHEMICALNOTIN (100mg/kg.bw.). CHEMICALIN (100μM) induced GENEIN and depleted heme pool when incubated to human hepatocytes. CHEMICALIN-stimulated (100mM) GENEIN upregulation was suppressed by CHEMICALIN but further enhanced by GENEIN inhibition with resultant CHEMICALIN accumulation. CHEMICALIN scavenging blocked the suppression of CHEMICALIN only on GENEIN activity. CHEMICALIN donor dose-dependently inactivated GENEIN of CHEMICALIN-incubated microsome, which was mimicked by GENENOTIN substrate but abolished by CHEMICALIN scavenger. Thus, GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN hepatotoxicity was alleviated by CHEMICALIN through GENEIN induction. Depleted heme pool and CHEMICALIN releasing limited protein synthesis and inhibited enzymatic activity of GENEIN, respectively.
23583510	Novel racemic CHEMICALIN analogues as potent GENEIN inhibitors. The synthesis of racemic CHEMICALNOTIN- (CHEMICALNOTIN-), CHEMICALNOTIN- (CHEMICALNOTIN-) and CHEMICALNOTIN- (CHEMICALNOTIN-) CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) analogues was achieved by utilizing the multi-component Biginelli reaction in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN as a catalyst. The evaluation of GENENOTIN inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease of these compounds showed that they exhibited higher inhibitory activity than their parent analogues. CHEMICALNOTIN demonstrated the most potent inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 1.34±0.03μM which was more active than the approved drug CHEMICALNOTIN (IC50=1.45±0.04μM).
23583603	Agonistic activity of CHEMICALIN on activation of GENEIN/GENEIN pathway in the rat uterus during the estrous cycle. We examined the ability of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) to block uterine cell proliferation via GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway in the uterus of the rat during the estrous cycle. Intact rats, with regular estrous cycles, received a subcutaneous (s.c.) injection of either vehicle or CHEMICALNOTIN at 08:00h on the day of proestrus or at 00:00h on the day of estrus and sacrificed at 13:00h of metaestrus. CHEMICALNOTIN (E2) and CHEMICALNOTIN (P4) plasma levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Both CHEMICALIN treatments, induced a significant decrease (p<0.01) in uterine GENEIN (GENEIN) content, had no effect on uterine GENEIN (GENEIN) protein expression and caused marked nuclear localization of GENEIN, in both luminal and glandular uterine epithelium, as compared to vehicle-treated animals. Furthermore, we detected that CHEMICALIN treatment induced GENEIN (GENEIN) Ser 9 phosphorylation, which correlates with GENEIN nuclear localization. However, some differences were observed between the two different time schedules of administration. We observed that the administration of CHEMICALIN at 08:00h on proestrus day produced a 15% inhibition of luminal epithelial cell proliferation, reduced uterine wet weight by 21% and caused reduction of GENEIN phosphorylation at CHEMICALIN 473 as compared to vehicle-treated animals, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN treatment at 00:00h on estrus day had no effect on these parameters. The overall results indicate that CHEMICALIN may exert agonistic and antagonistic effects on uterine cell proliferation through differential activation of the GENEIN pathway depending on the administration period during the estrous cycle, and indicates that the mechanism of cell proliferation during the physiological conditions of the estrous cycle, is under a different and more complex regulation than in the ovariectomized +E2 animal model.
23583910	CHEMICALIN derived from CHEMICALIN as a novel chemotype of GENEIN inhibitors. A series of CHEMICALIN, designed as mimics of a cationic high energy intermediate in the GENEIN (GENEIN)-mediated cyclization of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN was prepared from CHEMICALNOTIN. Screening on GENENOTIN from five different organisms revealed interesting activities and selectivities of some of the compounds. A CHEMICALIN derivative showed promising inhibition of GENEIN in combination with low cytotoxicity, and showed significant reduction of CHEMICALIN biosynthesis in a human cell line.
23583931	The CHEMICALIN required for potentiation of skeletal muscle contraction is released via GENEIN hemichannels. During repetitive stimulation of skeletal muscle, extracellular CHEMICALIN levels raise, activating GENEIN, increasing CHEMICALNOTIN influx, and enhancing contractile force, a response called potentiation. We found that CHEMICALNOTIN appears to be released through GENENOTIN hemichannels (GENENOTIN HCs). Immunocytochemical analyses and function were consistent with GENEIN localization to T-tubules intercalated with CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN in slow (soleus) and fast (extensor digitorum longus, EDL) muscles. Isolated myofibers took up CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and released small molecules (as CHEMICALNOTIN) during electrical stimulation. Consistent with two CHEMICALIN uptake pathways, induced uptake of CHEMICALIN, a fluorescent CHEMICALNOTIN derivative, was decreased by inhibition of HCs or GENEIN (GENEIN), and blocked by dual blockade. Adult skeletal muscles apparently do not express GENENOTIN, making it unlikely that GENENOTIN hemichannels contribute to the uptake and release of small molecules. CHEMICALNOTIN release, CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, and potentiation induced by repetitive electrical stimulation were blocked by HC blockers and did not occur in muscles of GENENOTIN knockout mice. MRS2179, a GENENOTIN blocker, prevented potentiation in EDL, but not soleus muscles, suggesting that in fast muscles CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN but not GENEIN. Phosphorylation on CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN residues of GENEIN was increased during potentiation, possibly mediating HC opening. Opening of GENEIN HCs during repetitive activation allows efflux of CHEMICALIN, influx of CHEMICALIN and possibly CHEMICALIN too, which are required for potentiation of contraction. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'GENENOTIN based channels'.
23585332	CHEMICALNOTIN reduces lipid accumulation in C57BL/6 mice with lower body weight gain. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a commonly used antioxidant additive that is approved for human use by both the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization (FAO/WHO). In this study, we examined the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on body weight gain and found that food supplementation with 0.001 % (w/w) CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited 61.4 % (P < 0.01) of body weight gain in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced C57BL/6 mice, and the oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (1.5 mg/kg) reduced 47.5 % (P < 0.05) of body weight gain in normal diet fed db/db mice. The HFD increased lipid deposit in adipocytes, but these were reduced significantly by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment in C57BL/6 mice. CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation significantly lowered the plasma CHEMICALNOTIN and total CHEMICALNOTIN, with reduced size of accumulated fat mass. The rate limiting enzyme of beta-oxidation (GENEIN) was significantly over-expressed in the liver with CHEMICALIN treatment. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN suppresses body weight gain in mice, possibly at least related to the up-regulation of GENEIN gene expression.
23585380	Dual Growth Factor Delivery Using Biocompatible Core-Shell Microcapsules for Angiogenesis. An optimized electrodropping system produces homogeneous core-shell microcapsules (C-S MCs) by using CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and alginate. Fluorescence imaging clearly shows the C-S domain in the MC. For release control, the use of high-molecular-weight CHEMICALNOTIN (HMW 270 000) restrains the initial burst release of protein compared to that of low-MW CHEMICALNOTIN (LMW 40 000). Layer-by-layer (LBL) assembly of chitosan and alginate on MCs is also useful in controlling the release profile of biomolecules. LBL (7-layer) treatment is effective in suppressing the initial burst release of protein compared to no LBL (0-layer). The difference of cumulative albumin release between HMW (7-layer LBL) and LMW (0-layer LBL) CHEMICALNOTIN is determined to be more than 40% on day 5. When dual angiogenic growth factors (GFs), such as GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), are encapsulated separately in the core and shell domains, respectively, the GENEIN release rate is much greater than that of GENEIN, and the difference of the cumulative release percentage between the two GFs is about 30% on day 7 with LMW core CHEMICALIN and more than 45% with HMW core CHEMICALIN. As for the angiogenic potential of MC GFs with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), the fluorescence signal of GENENOTIN+ suggests that the angiogenic sprout of ECs is more active in MC-mediated GF delivery than conventional GF delivery, and this difference is significant, based on the number of capillary branches in the unit area. This study demonstrates that the fabrication of biocompatible C-S MCs is possible, and that the release control of biomolecules is adjustable. Furthermore, MC-mediated GFs remain in an active form and can upregulate the angiogenic activity of ECs.
23587425	Potency switch between GENEIN and GENEIN: Discovery of CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-based GENEIN inhibitors. Chemistry has been developed to access both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Small structural modifications in both series led to a switch of potency between two GENENOTIN involved in mediating cell cycle checkpoint control, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN.
23589302	The GENENOTIN GENENOTIN is important for GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN phosphorylation, colony formation in soft agar and tumor growth in vivo. GENENOTIN is a cytoplasmic GENENOTIN that is activated in response to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) stimulation. In the present report, we show that GENENOTIN associates with the activated GENEIN (GENEIN) through multiple autophosphorylation sites, i.e. CHEMICALIN579, CHEMICALIN581, CHEMICALIN740 and CHEMICALIN1021. Using low molecular weight inhibitors, we found that GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN activation is dependent on GENENOTIN GENENOTIN activity, but not on the enzymatic activity of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. In cells in which GENENOTIN was downregulated using siRNA, GENENOTIN was unable to induce phosphorylation of GENENOTIN, whereas phosphorylations of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were unaffected. GENENOTIN-induced activation of GENENOTIN occurred also in cells expressing GENENOTIN-dead GENENOTIN, suggesting a GENENOTIN-independent adaptor role of GENENOTIN. Expression of GENENOTIN was dispensable for GENENOTIN-induced proliferation and migration, but essential for colony formation in soft agar. Tumor growth in vivo was delayed in cells depleted of GENENOTIN expression. Our data suggests a critical role of GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN activation and cell transformation.
23591110	Discovery of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as potent and selective GENEIN antagonists for the treatment of obesity (Part I). A series of structurally novel CHEMICALIN was derived from optimization of the HTS lead as selective GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonists. The SAR was explored and the data obtained set up the starting point and foundation for further optimization. The most potent tool compounds, as exemplified by compounds 2l, 5b, 5d, and 5e, displayed antagonism potencies in the subnanomolar range in in vitro GENENOTIN FLIPR assays and GENENOTIN binding assays.
23591590	Structure and energetics of gas phase CHEMICALNOTIN-bonding in GENENOTIN as studied by BIRD. Complexes of GENENOTIN with a range of anions (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)) have been studied in the gas phase by both experimental and theoretical methods. Temperature dependent blackbody infrared radiative dissociation (BIRD) experiments were performed on complexes of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, RB with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, and RT with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and the observed Arrhenius parameters are reported here. Master equation modeling of the BIRD kinetics data was carried out to determine threshold dissociation energies. Geometry optimizations and thermochemistry calculations were performed using the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory. Additional single point energies were calculated using MP2/6-311++G(2d,p). Results were examined in terms of the binding order of various anions as well as the added binding strength from additional CHEMICALNOTIN bonding (XB) interactions. The relative binding energies of ions were generally consistent with the ordering previously reported from solution phase experiments; however, the relatively strong binding of CHEMICALNOTIN to the bidentate receptor contrasted the solution phase observation of CHEMICALNOTINanions having weaker interactions when compared to CHEMICALNOTIN. An increase in the energy required to remove the same anion from the GENEIN when compared to the GENENOTIN is explained as being due to the increase in CHEMICALIN bonding interactions. The possibility of mixed CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN bonded complexes were considered.
23597506	CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency and heightened neuropathic pain in aged mice. Damaging of peripheral nerves may result in chronic neuropathic pain for which the likelihood is increased in the elderly. We assessed in mice if age-dependent alterations of endocannabinoids contributed to the heightened vulnerability to neuropathic pain at old age. We assessed nociception, endocannabinoids and the therapeutic efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN in young and aged mice in the spared nerve injury model of neuropathic pain. CHEMICALNOTIN was used because it is able to reduce neuropathic pain in young mice in part by increasing CHEMICALNOTIN. Aged mice developed stronger nociceptive hypersensitivity after sciatic nerve injury than young mice. This was associated with low CHEMICALNOTIN levels in the dorsal root ganglia, spinal cord, thalamus and cortex, which further decreased after nerve injury. In aged mice, CHEMICALNOTIN had only weak antinociceptive efficacy and it failed to restore normal CHEMICALNOTIN levels after nerve injury. In terms of the mechanisms, we found that GENEIN (GENEIN) which degrades CHEMICALIN, was upregulated after nerve injury at both ages, so that this upregulation likely did not account for the age-dependent differences. However, enzymes contributing to oxidative metabolism of CHEMICALIN, namely GENEIN and GENEIN, were increased in the brain of aged mice, possibly enhancing the oxidative breakdown of CHEMICALIN. This may overwhelm the capacity of CHEMICALNOTIN to restore CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis and may contribute to the heightened risk for neuropathic pain at old age.
23600667	Polymer-based protein engineering can rationally tune enzyme activity, pH-dependence, and stability. The attachment of inert polymers, such as polyethyleneglycol, to proteins has driven the emergence of a multibillion dollar biotechnology industry. In all cases, proteins have been stabilized or altered by covalently coupling the pre-existing polymer to the surface of the protein. This approach is inherently limited by a lack of exquisite control of polymer architecture, chain length, site and density of attachment. Using a novel water-soluble atom transfer radical polymerization initiator, we have grown temperature- and pH-responsive polymers from the surface of a model protein, the enzyme chymotrypsin. Poly(2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) changes in conformation with altered temperature and pH. Growing the polymer from the surface of chymotrypsin we were able to demonstrate that changes in temperature or pH can change predictably the conformation of the polymer surrounding the enzyme, which in turn enabled the rational tailoring of enzyme activity and stability. Using what we now term "Polymer-Based Protein Engineering" we have increased the activity and stability of chymotrypsin by an order of magnitude at pH's where the enzyme is usually inactive or unstable.
23600914	CHEMICALIN is actively eliminated from neuronal cells by GENEIN. High CHEMICALIN turnover catalyzed by GENEIN is essential for neural functions, especially learning. Because CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), produced by GENEIN, induces apoptosis of neuronal cells, it is vital to eliminate it rapidly from cells. Here, using differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells as a model, we examined whether CHEMICALNOTIN is actively eliminated via GENENOTIN induced by its accumulation. The expression of GENEIN and GENEIN was induced by CHEMICALIN, as well as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, which are ligands of the GENEIN GENEIN/GENEIN. When the expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was induced, CHEMICALIN efflux was stimulated in the presence of GENEIN (GENEIN), whereas GENEIN was not an efficient acceptor. The efflux was suppressed by the addition of siRNA against GENENOTIN, but not by GENENOTIN siRNA. To confirm the role of each transporter, we analyzed HEK293 cells stably expressing GENEIN or GENEIN; we clearly observed CHEMICALIN efflux in the presence of GENEIN, whereas efflux in the presence of GENEIN was marginal. Furthermore, the treatment of primary cerebral neurons with GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ligands suppressed the toxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN. These results suggest that GENEIN actively eliminates CHEMICALIN in the presence of GENEIN as a lipid acceptor and protects neuronal cells. This article is protected by copyright.

23601203	Design, Synthesis and biological evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN vehicle for studying dopaminergic system. CHEMICALNOTIN mimetic CHEMICALNOTIN was synthesized and characterized by various spectroscopic techniques (NMR, Mass spectroscopy) and λem 310 nm for the excitation at 270 nm. Molecular docking studies were performed with GENEIN (GENEIN: PDB 1E78), showing binding pattern with CHEMICALIN residues CHEMICALIN218, CHEMICALIN222 and CHEMICALIN444, identifies the ligand-GENENOTIN interaction for the transportation affinity of the ligand at the specific site of the target. Subsequently binding study with HSA at λex =350 nm found to be 5.847x10(4) M(-1) shows effective quenching effect. Additionally to go more insight AChE binding affinity was investigated, which shows 90% binding affinity for the 10 mM concentration. IC50 value was was found 18.60 μM for GENENOTIN inhibition. Finally, CHEMICALNOTIN labeled with CHEMICALNOTIN to investigate its in-vivo radiopharmaceutical efficiency, having 97% binding affinity with 98% radiochemical purity. In-vivo studies were carried out for CHEMICALNOTIN included blood kinetics showed a quick wash out from the circulation via renal route and biodistribution revealed that maximum%ID/g was found in kidney at 1h and its scintigraphy image shows 3.96% brain uptake with respect to whole body.

23602864	Synergistic enhancement of cancer therapy using a combination of heat shock protein targeted HPMA copolymer-drug conjugates and gold nanorod induced hyperthermia. In the field of nanomedicine, selective delivery to cancer cells is a common goal, where active targeting strategies are often employed to increase tumor accumulation. In this study, tumor hyperthermia was utilized as a means to increase the active delivery of heat shock protein (HSP) targeted N-(2-hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer-drug conjugates. Following hyperthermia, induced expression of cell surface heat shock protein (HSP) glucose regulated protein 78kDa (GRP78) was utilized for targeted drug therapy. Conjugates bearing the anticancer agents aminohexylgeldanamycin (AHGDM), docetaxel (DOC), or cisplatin and the GRP78 targeting peptide WDLAWMFRLPVG were synthesized and characterized. Binding to cell surface expressed heat shock protein GRP78 on the surface of human prostate cancer DU145 cells was evaluated. HSP targeted AHGDM and DOC conjugates demonstrated active binding comparable to native targeting peptide. They were then assessed in vitro for the ability to synergistically induce cytotoxicity in combination with moderate hyperthermia (43°C, 30min). HSP targeted DOC conjugates exhibited high potency against DU145 cells with an IC50 of 2.4nM. HSP targeted AHGDM and DOC conjugates demonstrated synergistic effects in combination with hyperthermia with combination index values of 0.65 and 0.45 respectively. Based on these results, HSP targeted DOC conjugates were selected for in vivo evaluation. In DU145 tumor bearing mice, a single treatment of tumor hyperthermia, induced via gold nanorod mediated plasmonic photothermal therapy, and intravenous administration of HSP targeted HPMA copolymer-docetaxel at 10mg/kg resulted in maintained tumor regression for a period of 30days. These results demonstrate the potential for tumor hyperthermia to increase the delivery of HSP targeted macromolecular chemotherapeutics.
23602989	Presynaptic GENEIN modulates GENEIN activation in striatonigral terminals of the rat brain in a CHEMICALIN dependent manner. GENENOTIN is expressed at high density in the nucleus accumbens where it binds to postsynaptic GENENOTIN inhibiting their effects. In striatonigral projections, activation of presynaptic GENENOTIN potentiates GENENOTIN-induced stimulation of cAMP production and GABA release. In this study we examined whether the presynaptic effects of GENENOTIN stimulation in the substantia nigra reticulata (SNr) are modulated by CHEMICALNOTIN activation of GENENOTIN. In SNr synaptosomes two procedures that increase cytoplasmic CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-depolarization, blocked the additional stimulation of CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation produced by coactivating GENENOTIN. The selective GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN reversed the blockade produced by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-depolarization. Incubation in either CHEMICALNOTIN -free solutions or with the selective CHEMICALNOTIN blocker CHEMICALNOTIN, also reversed the blocking effects of CHEMICALNOTIN-depolarization. Immunoblot studies showed that CHEMICALIN-depolarization increased GENEIN phosphorylation in a CHEMICALIN sensitive manner and promoted GENEIN binding to GENEIN. In CHEMICALNOTIN-depolarized tissues, GENENOTIN potentiated GENENOTIN-induced stimulation of CHEMICALNOTIN release only when GENEIN was blocked with CHEMICALIN. In the presence of this inhibitor, the selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN reduced the ED50 for the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN from 56 to 4 nM. CHEMICALNOTIN also enhanced the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on depolarization induced CHEMICALNOTIN release. CHEMICALNOTIN changed ED50 for CHEMICALNOTIN from 584 to 56 nM. CHEMICALNOTIN did not affect GENENOTIN responses. These experiments show that in striatonigral projections, GENEIN inhibits the action of GENEIN in a CHEMICALIN dependent manner blocking their modulatory effects on CHEMICALNOTIN release. These findings suggest a mechanism through which the frequency of action potential discharge in presynaptic terminals regulates CHEMICALNOTIN effects.
23603381	Ellagic acid attenuates bleomycin and cyclophosphamide-induced pulmonary toxicity in Wistar rats. Use of bleomycin (BLM) and cyclophosphamide (CP) as chemotherapeutic drugs is associated with side effects including toxicity to respiratory system. Their co-administration may enhance lung toxicity which may subsequently progress to the lung fibrosis. Natural compounds have shown mitigating effects against toxicity of anticancer drugs. Ellagic acid (EA), a polyphenolic compound present in many fruits and nuts in addition to walnut has shown promising protective effect against toxicity of drugs and chemicals. We studied the ameliorative effect of EA on lung toxicity in rats exposed to CP (150mg/kgb.w., i.p.) and BLM (10U/kgb.w., i.t.). EA (15mg/kgb.w., p.o.×14days) treatment modulated enhanced hydroxyproline level, lipid peroxidation, myeloperoxidase activity, nitric oxide production and protein carbonyl formation in lungs of rats exposed to toxic anticancer drugs. There was a marked decrease in GSH content and activities of antioxidant enzymes as a result of BLM and CP treatment. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid showed increased level of cytotoxicity markers in drug treated animals. Treatment with EA attenuated these changes. Histopathological findings also showed protective effects of EA. In conclusion, EA emerged as a natural protectant with an ability to protect lungs from onslaught of pulmonary toxicity of anticancer drugs.
23605050	Effects of High CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN Concentrations over the Relative Expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN in MIN6 Cells. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by hyperglycemia and oxidative stress. Hyperglycemia is linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and reduced β-cell mass due to the reduced expression of genes such as GENENOTIN as well as the participation of the GENENOTIN gene family, responsible for increased apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to describe the effect of different CHEMICALNOTIN and/or CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations over GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN expressions in a β-pancreatic cell line (MIN6 cells). MIN6 cells were pre-incubated with different CHEMICALNOTIN and/or CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations, and the relative mRNA abundance of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ratio and of GENENOTIN genes was measured by qRT-PCR. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity, CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, GENENOTIN activity, and CHEMICALNOTIN content were also determined. The GENEIN/GENEIN ratio increased and GENEIN expression decreased in MIN6 cells after CHEMICALIN stimulation. These effects were higher when CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were incubated together. Additionally, treatment with CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN showed a higher GENEIN activity. Our study revealed that high CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN concentrations in MIN6 cells induced an increase of the GENEIN/GENEIN ratio, an indicator of increased cell apoptosis.
23607523	Genetic Insights into CHEMICALNOTIN Biosynthesis in Nonomuraea spiralis IMC A-0156. The biosynthetic gene cluster for the CHEMICALNOTIN antibiotics has been cloned and sequenced from Nonomuraea spiralis IMC A-0156. The 41 kb gene cluster contains 27 ORFs predicted to encode all of the functions for CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis. This includes GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) required for the formation of the CHEMICALIN core unit, as well as a suite of tailoring enzymes (e.g., four GENEIN, an GENEIN, and an GENEIN) necessary for further modifications of the core structure. The GENENOTIN is predicted to transfer either CHEMICALNOTIN or a pseudosugar (CHEMICALNOTIN) to the aglycone. A gene cassette encoding CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthetic enzymes was identified upstream of the CHEMICALNOTIN-specific ORFs. Targeted disruption of the gene encoding the GENEIN, GENEIN, abolished CHEMICALIN production, and recombinant expression of GENEIN confirms the activity of this enzyme as a GENEIN involved in the formation of the CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN moiety.
23607712	GENEIN is required for vesicular CHEMICALIN /CHEMICALIN -antiport activity. A low-affinity CHEMICALNOTIN /CHEMICALNOTIN -antiport was described in the membrane of mammalian brain synaptic vesicles. Electrophysiological studies showed that this antiport contributes to the extreme brevity of excitation-release coupling in rapid synapses. GENEIN, a vesicular protein interacting with membranes upon low-affinity CHEMICALIN -binding, plays a major role in excitation-release coupling, by synchronizing CHEMICALIN entry with fast neurotransmitter release. Here, we report that GENEIN is necessary for expression of the vesicular CHEMICALIN /CHEMICALIN -antiport. We measured CHEMICALNOTIN /CHEMICALNOTIN -antiport activity in vesicles and granules of pheochromocytoma PC12 cells by three methods: (1) CHEMICALNOTIN -induced dissipation of the vesicular CHEMICALNOTIN -gradient; (2) CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation and (3) pH-jump-induced CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation. The results were congruent and highly significant: CHEMICALIN /CHEMICALIN -antiport activity is detectable only in acidic organelles expressing functional GENEIN. In contrast, GENENOTIN-deficient cells - and cells where transgenically encoded GENENOTIN was acutely photo-inactivated - were devoid of any CHEMICALNOTIN /CHEMICALNOTIN -antiport activity. Therefore, in addition to its previously described functions, GENEIN is involved in a rapid vesicular CHEMICALIN sequestration through a CHEMICALIN /CHEMICALIN antiport.

23608737	CHEMICALNOTIN replacement enhances CHEMICALIN-stimulated locomotion in female C57BL/6 mice through GENEIN. Psychostimulant effects are enhanced by ovarian hormones in women and female rodents. CHEMICALNOTIN increases behavioral responses to psychostimulants in women and female rats, although the underlying mechanism is unknown. This study utilized mice to investigate the time frame and receptor mediation of CHEMICALNOTIN's enhancement of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced behavior as mice enable parallel use of genetic, surgical and pharmacological methods. The spontaneous behavior of Sham and Ovariectomized (Ovx) female wildtype (WT) mice was determined during habituation to a novel environment and after CHEMICALNOTIN administration. Ovx mice were replaced with vehicle (sesame oil) or CHEMICALNOTIN (E2) for 2 days or 30 min prior to a CHEMICALNOTIN challenge to investigate the time course of E2's effects. To examine receptor mediation of CHEMICALNOTIN effects, Ovx mice replaced for 2 days with either the GENEIN-selective agonist CHEMICALIN or the GENEIN-selective agonist CHEMICALIN were compared to Sham mice, and mice lacking either GENENOTIN (GENENOTINKO) or GENENOTIN (GENENOTINKO) were compared to WT littermates. Ovx mice exhibited fewer ambulations during habituation than Sham females. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increases in behavioral ratings were greater in Sham than in Ovx mice. Two days but not 30 min of E2 replacement in Ovx mice increased CHEMICALNOTIN responses to Sham levels. CHEMICALNOTIN replacement also increased the CHEMICALNOTIN response relative to vehicle- or CHEMICALNOTIN- treated Ovx mice. GENENOTINKO mice displayed modestly attenuated behavioral responses to novelty and CHEMICALNOTIN compared to αWT littermates, but no behavioral differences were found between GENENOTINKO and βWT mice. These results suggest that E2 enhances CHEMICALIN-stimulated locomotion in mice predominantly through GENEIN.
23609128	Dynamics and structural changes of small water clusters on ionization. Despite utmost importance in understanding water ionization process, reliable theoretical results of structural changes and molecular dynamics (MD) of water clusters on ionization have hardly been reported yet. Here, we investigate the water cations [(H2 O)n = 2-6 (+) ] with density functional theory (DFT), Möller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (MP2), and coupled cluster theory with single, double, and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. The complete basis set limits of interaction energies at the CCSD(T) level are reported, and the geometrical structures, electronic properties, and infrared spectra are investigated. The characteristics of structures and spectra of the water cluster cations reflect the formation of the hydronium cation moiety (H3 O(+) ) and the hydroxyl radical. Although most density functionals fail to predict reasonable energetics of the water cations, some functionals are found to be reliable, in reasonable agreement with high-level ab initio results. To understand the ionization process of water clusters, DFT- and MP2-based Born-Oppenheimer MD (BOMD) simulations are performed on ionization. On ionization, the water clusters tend to have an Eigen-like form with the hydronium cation instead of a Zundel-like form, based on reliable BOMD simulations. For the vertically ionized water hexamer, the relatively stable (H2 O)5 (+) (5sL4A) cluster tends to form with a detached water molecule (H2 O). © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.
23609438	The GENEIN Regulates Vascular Smooth Muscle Cell Proliferation via Controlling CHEMICALIN-dependent Signaling. The GENENOTIN contributes to a variety of cell activation processes in pathologies such as inflammation, carcinogenesis and vascular remodeling. We examined the electrophysiological and transcriptional mechanisms by which GENENOTIN regulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-induced proliferation of human coronary artery VSMCs was attenuated by lowering intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentration ([CHEMICALNOTIN]i) and was enhanced by elevating [CHEMICALNOTIN]i. GENENOTIN blockade or knockdown inhibited proliferation by suppressing the rise in [CHEMICALNOTIN]i and attenuating the expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). This anti-proliferative effect was abolished by elevating [CHEMICALNOTIN]i. GENENOTIN overexpression induced VSMC proliferation, and potentiated GENENOTIN-induced proliferation, by inducing GENENOTIN phosphorylation, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Pharmacological stimulation of GENENOTIN unexpectedly suppressed proliferation by inhibiting the rise in [CHEMICALNOTIN]i and abolishing the expression and activity of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The stimulation also attenuated the levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression. After GENENOTIN blockade, the characteristic round shape of VSMCs expressing high GENENOTIN and low GENENOTIN (dedifferentiation state) was maintained, whereas GENENOTIN stimulation induced a spindle-shape cellular appearance, with low GENENOTIN and high GENENOTIN. In conclusion, GENENOTIN plays an important role in VSMC proliferation via controlling CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent signaling pathways and its modulation may therefore constitute a new therapeutic target for cell proliferative diseases such as atherosclerosis.
23610086	Reactive Metabolite Trapping Studies on CHEMICALIN-based Inverse Agonists of the GENEIN. The current study examined the bioactivation potential of GENEIN inverse agonists, CHEMICALIN (1) and CHEMICALIN (2), containing a fused CHEMICALIN motif in the core structure. Both compounds underwent oxidative metabolism in CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-supplemented human liver microsomes to yield CHEMICALNOTIN conjugates, which was consistent with their bioactivation to reactive species. Mass spectral fragmentation and NMR analysis indicated that the site of attachment of the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety in the CHEMICALNOTIN conjugates was on the CHEMICALNOTIN ring within the bicycle. Two CHEMICALNOTIN conjugates were discerned with the CHEMICALNOTIN derivative 1. One adduct was derived from the Michael addition of CHEMICALNOTIN to a putative CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite of 1, whereas, the second adduct was formed via the reaction of a second CHEMICALNOTIN molecule with the initial CHEMICALNOTIN adduct. In the case of the CHEMICALNOTIN analog 2, CHEMICALNOTIN conjugation occurred via an oxidative desulfation mechanism, possibly involving CHEMICALNOTIN ring epoxidation as the rate-limiting step. Additional insights into the mechanism were obtained via CHEMICALNOTIN exchange and trapping studies with CHEMICALNOTIN. The mechanistic insights into the bioactivation pathways of 1 and 2 allowed the deployment of a rational chemical intervention strategy that involved replacement of the CHEMICALNOTIN ring with a CHEMICALNOTIN group to yield CHEMICALNOTIN (3). These structural changes not only abrogated the bioactivation liability but also retained the attractive pharmacological attributes of the prototype agents.
23614728	Adenovirus-delivered angiopoietin-1 treatment for phosgene-induced acute lung injury. Abstract Context: Exposure to phosgene can result in an acute lung injury, leading to pulmonary edema and even death. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) is a critical factor for vascular stabilization due to its ability to reduce endothelial permeability and inflammation. Objective: In this study, the histopathological changes of the lungs after exposure to phosgene and the effect of Ang1 treatment were examined. Materials and methods: Rats were exposed to phosgene gas at 8.33 g/m(3) for 5 min. Ang1 overexpressing rats were established by an intravenous injection of adenovirus-Ang1 (Ad/Ang1). The histological changes of the lung were examined by Haematoxylin-Eosin (H&E) staining and fluorescence microscopy. The inferior lobe was used for the determination of the ratio of wet weight to dry weight of the lung. The concentration of cytokines in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results: The pathological analysis showed signs of inflammation and edema, evident from a significant increase in the number of leukocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and the ratio of wet to dry weight of the lungs. The lung injury induced by phosgene was markedly reduced after the injection of Ad/Ang1. The increase of IL-1β and IL-17 and decrease of vascular endothelial growth factor in the serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of phosgene-exposed animals were abolished by the administration of Ad/Ang1. Discussion and conclusions: Ang1 has the beneficial effects on phosgene-induced lung injury. The adenovirus-delivered Ang1 may have the potential as a novel approach for the treatment of the acute lung injury caused by phosgene gas inhalation in humans.
23617725	Probing the Role of the CHEMICALNOTIN E-Ring CHEMICALNOTIN: Selective Divergent Synthesis and Evaluation of Alternatively Substituted E-Ring Analogues. The selective functionalization of a CHEMICALNOTIN aglycon derivative through direct conversion of the E-ring CHEMICALNOTIN to a reactive CHEMICALNOTIN, and its use in the synthesis of a systematic series of CHEMICALNOTIN E-ring analogues are described. The series of analogues was used to examine the impact of the E-ring chloride in binding CHEMICALNOTIN and on antimicrobial activity. In contrast to the reduced activity of the unsubstituted E-ring derivatives, hydrophobic and relatively non-polar substituents approach or match the CHEMICALNOTIN and was insensitive to the electronic character of the substituent (e.g. CHEMICALNOTIN vs CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN), whereas highly polar substituents fail to provide the enhancements. Moreover, the active permethylated CHEMICALIN aglycon derivatives examined exhibit GENEIN VRE antimicrobial activity at levels that approach (typically within 2-fold) their activity against sensitive bacteria. The robust borylation reaction also enabled the selective functionalization of a minimally protected CHEMICALNOTIN aglycon (CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN aglycon), and provides a direct method for the preparation of previously inaccessible analogues.
23619606	Exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN decreased four CHEMICALNOTIN levels in plasma of prepartum mice. Maternal exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) decreased the plasma CHEMICALNOTIN in prepartum mice. To identify the CHEMICALNOTIN (FA) species involved and to understand the underlying mechanisms, pregnant Sv/129 wild-type (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN-null (GENENOTIN-null) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mice were treated with diets containing 0%, 0.01%, 0.05% or 0.1% CHEMICALNOTIN. Dams were dissected on gestational day 18 together with fetuses, and on postnatal day 2 together with newborns. CHEMICALNOTIN in maternal plasma and in liver of wild-type offspring, and representative enzymes for FA desaturation and elongation in maternal liver, were measured. The plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were higher in the pregnant control GENENOTIN mice than in GENENOTIN-null and GENENOTIN mice. CHEMICALIN exposure significantly decreased the levels of these four FAs only in pregnant GENEIN mice. Plasma levels of many FAs were higher in pregnant mice than in postpartum ones in a genotype-independent manner, while it was lower in the livers of fetuses than pups. CHEMICALNOTIN exposure slightly increased hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in fetuses, but not in pups. However, CHEMICALNOTIN exposure did not clearly influence GENENOTIN nor GENENOTIN expressions in the liver of all maternal mice. Taken together, the levels of plasma four FAs with shorter CHEMICALNOTIN chains were higher in pregnant GENENOTIN mice than in other genotypes, and CHEMICALIN exposure decreased these specific FA concentrations only in GENEIN mice, similarly to CHEMICALNOTIN levels.
23619613	Soluble GENENOTIN: a novel player of the innate immune system in the lung. Posttranslational modification of the GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is well studied in the nervous system and described as a dynamic modulator of plastic processes like precursor cell migration, axon fasciculation, and synaptic plasticity. Here, we describe a novel function of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in innate immunity of the lung. In mature lung tissue of healthy donors, CHEMICALIN was exclusively attached to the transmembrane isoform GENEIN and located to intracellular compartments of epithelial cells. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, however, increased CHEMICALNOTIN levels and processing of the GENENOTIN carrier were observed. Processing of GENEIN was reproduced in a mouse model by CHEMICALIN administration leading to an activation of the inflammasome and secretion of GENEIN. As shown in a cell culture model, CHEMICALIN-GENEIN was kept in the late trans-Golgi apparatus of lung epithelial cells and stimulation by GENENOTIN or lipopolysaccharide induced GENENOTIN-mediated GENENOTIN shedding, resulting in the secretion of soluble GENENOTIN. Interestingly, CHEMICALIN chains of secreted GENEIN neutralized the cytotoxic activity of extracellular GENEIN as well as DNA/GENEIN-network-containing "neutrophil extracellular traps", which are formed during invasion of microorganisms. Thus, shedding of GENENOTIN by lung epithelial cells may provide a host-protective mechanism to reduce tissue damage during inflammatory processes.
23620256	Study of endothelial cell apoptosis using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor cell line with hemodynamic microfluidic chip system. To better understand how hyperglycemia induces endothelial cell dysfunction under the diabetic conditions, a hemodynamic microfluidic chip system was developed. The system combines a caspase-3-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) biosensor cell line which can detect endothelial cell apoptosis in real-time, post-treatment effect and with a limited cell sample, by using a microfluidic chip which can mimic the physiological pulsatile flow profile in the blood vessel. The caspase-3-based FRET biosensor endothelial cell line (HUVEC-C3) can produce a FRET-based sensor protein capable of probing caspase-3 activation. When the endothelial cells undergo apoptosis, the color of the sensor cells changes from green to blue, thus sensing apoptosis. A double-labeling fluorescent technique (yo pro-1 and propidium iodide) was used to validate the findings revealed by the FRET-based caspase sensor. The results show high rates of apoptosis and necrosis of endothelial cells when high glucose concentration was applied in our hemodynamic microfluidic chip combined with an exhaustive pulsatile flow profile. The two apoptosis detection techniques (fluorescent method and FRET biosensor) are comparable; but FRET biosensor offers more advantages such as real-time observation and a convenient operating process to generate more accurate and reliable data. Furthermore, the activation of the FRET biosensor also confirms the endothelial cell apoptosis induced by the abnormal pulsatile shear stress and high glucose concentration is through caspase-3 pathway. A 12% apoptotic rate (nearly a 4-fold increase compared to the static condition) was observed when the endothelial cells were exposed to a high glucose concentration of 20 mM under 2 h exhaustive pulsatile shear stress of 30 dyne cm(-2) and followed with another 10 h normal pulsatile shear stress of 15 dyne cm(-2). Therefore, the most important finding of this study is to develop a novel endothelial cell apoptosis detection method, which combines the microfluidic chip system and FRET biosensor. This finding may provide new insight into how glucose causes endothelial cell dysfunction, which is the major cause of diabetes-derived complications.
23620529	High salt diets during pregnancy affected fetal and offspring renal renin-angiotensin system. Intrauterine environments are linked to fetal renal development and postnatal health. Influence of salt diets during pregnancy on renal functions and renin-angiotensin system (RAS) were determined in the ovine fetus and offspring. Pregnant ewes were fed high-salt diet (HSD) or normal-salt diet (NSD) for two months during middle-later gestation. Fetal renal functions, plasma hormones, mRNA and protein expressions of the key elements of renal RAS were measured in the fetus and offspring. Fetal renal excretion of sodium was increased while urine volume decreased in HSD group. Fetal blood urea nitrogen was increased, while kidney/body weight ratio decreased in HSD group. The altered ratio also was observed in the offspring at 15-day-old and 90-day-old. Maternal and fetal plasma antidiuretic hormone was elevated without change in plasma renin activity and Ang I levels, while plasma Ang II was decreased. The key elements of local renal RAS, including angiotensinogen, ACE, ACE2, AT1 and AT2 receptor expression in both mRNA and protein, except renin, were altered following maternal high salt intake. The results suggest that High intake of salt during pregnancy affected fetal renal development associated with an altered expression of the renal key elements of RAS, some alterations of fetal origins remained after birth as possible risks in developing renal or cardiovascular diseases.
23623491	Synthesis of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine linked aminobenzothiazole conjugates as potential anticancer agents. A series of pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyrimidine linked 2-aminobenzothizole conjugates (6a-t) were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer activity against five human cancer cell lines. Among them two compounds 6p and 6m showed significant anticancer activity with IC50 values ranging from 2.01 to 7.07 and 1.94-3.46μM, respectively. Moreover, cell cycle arrest in G2/M and reduction in Cdk1 expression level were observed upon treatment of these compounds and they also induced caspase-3 dependent apoptosis. This was further confirmed by staining as well as DNA fragmentation analysis.
23624419	Evaluation of the positive effects on GENENOTIN-resistance and β-cell measurements of CHEMICALNOTIN in addition to CHEMICALNOTIN in type 2 diabetic patients. We evaluated the positive effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in addition to CHEMICALNOTIN on glycemic control and β-cell function in type 2 diabetic patients. One hundred and seventy-one type 2 diabetic patients were instructed to add CHEMICALNOTIN 50mg twice a day or placebo to CHEMICALNOTIN for 12 months. Body mass index (BMI), glycemic control, fasting plasma GENENOTIN (FPI), HOMA-IR, HOMA-β, fasting plasma GENENOTIN (FPPr), GENENOTIN/fasting plasma GENENOTIN ratio (Pr/FPI ratio), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN were evaluated. Before, and after 12 months since the addition of CHEMICALNOTIN, patients underwent a combined euglycemic hyperinsulinemic and hyperglycemic clamp, with subsequent CHEMICALNOTIN stimulation. CHEMICALIN+CHEMICALIN were more effective than placebo+CHEMICALIN in reducing body weight and BMI, glycemic control, HOMA-IR, GENEIN and GENEIN resistance measurements. CHEMICALNOTIN+CHEMICALNOTIN gave also a better increase of HOMA-β, and of all β-cell parameters after the clamp. We also recorded a significant correlation between M value increase and the decrease of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN obtained with CHEMICALIN+CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN, in addition to CHEMICALIN, proved to be effective in improving β-cell function and in reducing GENEIN resistance measurements.
23624423	CHEMICALIN-stimulated processing of GENEIN is mediated via GENEIN (GENEIN and accompanied by enhanced migration in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Over-expression of cleaved GENENOTIN in breast tumors is closely associated with tumor progression and resistance to antiestrogens. CHEMICALIN (E2) has been recently shown to induce GENEIN processing in breast cancer cells. CHEMICALNOTIN has been used in patients with CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive breast cancer, yet resistance to antiestrogens and recurrence will appear in some of the patients after its continued use. We therefore addressed possible effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the generation of cleaved GENENOTIN and its signal mechanism(s) in CHEMICALNOTIN-responsive MCF-7 breast cancer cells that express both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN's active form) failed to prevent E2-induced proteolysis of GENEIN and migration, but rather triggered GENEIN cleavage coincident with augmented migration. CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN truncation also occurred in SK-BR-3 cells that express GENEIN and lack GENENOTIN, but not in MDA-MB-231 cells that express neither GENENOTIN nor GENENOTIN. G1, a specific GENENOTIN agonist, caused dramatic proteolysis of GENENOTIN and enhanced migration. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN-stimulated cleavage of GENEIN and migration were tremendously attenuated by G15, a GENENOTIN antagonist, or siRNA against GENENOTIN. In addition, inhibitors for GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN remarkably suppressed CHEMICALIN-induced truncation of GENEIN, suggesting involvement of GENEIN signaling. Collectively, our data indicate that CHEMICALIN contributes to the production of proteolyzed GENEIN via GENEIN with augmented migration in MCF-7 cells.
23625804	Mechanistic Aspects of GENEIN Maturation from the Solution Structure of CHEMICALIN -Loaded GENEIN and Analysis of CHEMICALNOTIN-Free GENENOTIN Mutants. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) maturation within the cell is mainly accomplished with the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, a dimeric protein with three distinct domains in each monomer. We recently showed that the first domain of GENEIN (GENEIN) is responsible for CHEMICALIN transfer to its protein partner, GENEIN (GENEIN). The NMR solution structure of the CHEMICALIN-loaded form of GENEIN reported here contributes further to characterization of the copper-transfer mechanism to GENENOTIN. NMR spectroscopy was also used to examine the GENENOTIN mutants GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, which are unable to form the structurally conserved CHEMICALNOTIN bond in GENENOTIN, in order to investigate the role of these CHEMICALIN during GENEIN copper acquisition. Together, the information on both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, along with a sequence analysis of eukaryotic GENENOTIN, allows us to propose important mechanistic aspects regarding the CHEMICALIN-transfer process from GENEIN to GENEIN.
23626400	Novel pentablock copolymer (PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA) based nanoparticles for controlled drug delivery: Effect of copolymer compositions on the crystallinity of copolymers and in vitro drug release profile from nanoparticles. The purpose of this investigation was to design novel pentablock copolymers (polylatide-polycaprolactone-polyethylene glycol- polycaprolactone-polylatide) (PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA) to prepare nanoparticle formulations which provide continuous delivery of steroids over a longer duration with minimal burst effect. Another purpose was to evaluate the effect of poly (L-lactide) (PLLA) or poly (D, L-lactide) (PDLLA) incorporation on crystallinity of pentablock copolymers and in vitro release profile of triamcinolone acetonide (selected as model drug) from nanoparticles. PLA-PCL-PEG-PCL-PLA copolymers with different block ratio of PCL/PLA segment were synthesized. Release of triamcinolone acetonide from nanoparticles was significantly affected by crystallinity of the copolymers. Burst release of triamcinolone acetonide from nanoparticles was significantly minimized with incorporation of proper ratio of PDLLA in the existing triblock (PCL-PEG-PCL) copolymer. Moreover, pentablock copolymer based nanoparticles exhibited continuous release of triamcinolone acetonide. Pentablock copolymer based nanoparticles can be utilized to achieve continuous near zero-order delivery of corticosteroids from nanoparticles without any burst effect.
23630454	PICK1 Deficiency Impairs Secretory Vesicle Biogenesis and Leads to Growth Retardation and Decreased Glucose Tolerance. Secretory vesicles in endocrine cells store hormones such as growth hormone (GH) and insulin before their release into the bloodstream. The molecular mechanisms governing budding of immature secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and their subsequent maturation remain unclear. Here, we identify the lipid binding BAR (Bin/amphiphysin/Rvs) domain protein PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase 1) as a key component early in the biogenesis of secretory vesicles in GH-producing cells. Both PICK1-deficient Drosophila and mice displayed somatic growth retardation. Growth retardation was rescued in flies by reintroducing PICK1 in neurosecretory cells producing somatotropic peptides. PICK1-deficient mice were characterized by decreased body weight and length, increased fat accumulation, impaired GH secretion, and decreased storage of GH in the pituitary. Decreased GH storage was supported by electron microscopy showing prominent reduction in secretory vesicle number. Evidence was also obtained for impaired insulin secretion associated with decreased glucose tolerance. PICK1 localized in cells to immature secretory vesicles, and the PICK1 BAR domain was shown by live imaging to associate with vesicles budding from the TGN and to possess membrane-sculpting properties in vitro. In mouse pituitary, PICK1 co-localized with the BAR domain protein ICA69, and PICK1 deficiency abolished ICA69 protein expression. In the Drosophila brain, PICK1 and ICA69 co-immunoprecipitated and showed mutually dependent expression. Finally, both in a Drosophila model of type 2 diabetes and in high-fat-diet-induced obese mice, we observed up-regulation of PICK1 mRNA expression. Our findings suggest that PICK1, together with ICA69, is critical during budding of immature secretory vesicles from the TGN and thus for vesicular storage of GH and possibly other hormones. The data link two BAR domain proteins to membrane remodeling processes in the secretory pathway of peptidergic endocrine cells and support an important role of PICK1/ICA69 in maintenance of metabolic homeostasis.
23631463	Design, Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of CHEMICALIN Derivatives as GENEIN Ligands with Potential for Treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN Abuse. Attenuation of increased endocannabinoid signaling with a GENENOTIN neutral antagonist might offer a new therapeutic direction for treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN abuse. We have recently reported that a mono-hydroxylated metabolite of the synthetic CHEMICALIN cannabinoid CHEMICALIN (3) exhibits neutral antagonist activity at GENEIN and thus may serve as a promising lead for the development of novel CHEMICALNOTIN abuse therapies. In the current study, we show that systematic modification of an CHEMICALIN scaffold identifies two new compounds with dual GENEIN antagonist/GENEIN agonist activity. Similar to the GENENOTIN antagonist/inverse agonist rimonabant, analogues 27 and 30 decrease oral CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration, without affecting total fluid intake and block the development of CHEMICALNOTIN-conditioned place preference. Collectively, these initial findings suggest that design and systematic modification of CHEMICALIN such as 3 may lead to development of novel cannabinoid ligands with dual GENEIN antagonist/GENEIN agonist activity with potential for use as treatments of CHEMICALNOTIN abuse.
23632310	Immunoregulatory effects of CHEMICALIN exerts anti-asthmatic effects via modulation of Th1/Th2 GENEIN and enhancement of CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells in GENEIN-sensitized mice. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: CHEMICALNOTIN (GA) is the main bioactive ingredient of licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra), and has been found to be associated with multiple therapeutic properties. AIM OF THE STUDY: In this study, we investigated immunoregulatory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on anti-asthmatic effects and underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Asthma model was established by GENENOTIN-induced. A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, CHEMICALNOTIN (2mg/kg) and GA (10mg/kg, 20mg/kg, 40mg/kg). Airway resistance (Raw) were measured by the forced oscillation technique, histological studies were evaluated by The CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (HE) staining, Th1/Th2 and Th17 GENENOTIN were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) was evaluated by Flow Cytometry (FCM), the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was evaluated by western blotting. RESULTS: Our study demonstrated that, compared with model group, GA inhibited GENENOTIN-induced increases in Raw and eosinophil count; GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN levels were recovered in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid compared; increased GENENOTINlevel in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; histological studies demonstrated that GA substantially inhibited GENENOTIN-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue and airway tissue compared with model group. Flow cytometry studies demonstrated that GA substantially enhanced Tregs compared with model group. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that GA may effectively ameliorate the progression of asthma and could be used as a therapy for patients with allergic asthma.
23636640	Enhanced beta cell function and anti-inflammatory effect after chronic treatment with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN in an advanced-aged diet-induced obesity mouse model. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Studies have shown that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors stimulate GENENOTIN secretion and increase beta cell mass in rodents. However, in these models hyperglycaemia has been induced early on in life and the treatment periods have been short. To explore the long-term effects of GENENOTIN inhibition on GENENOTIN secretion and beta cell mass, we have generated a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced-obesity model in mice of advanced age (10 months old). METHODS: After 1 month of HFD alone, the mice were given the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN for a further 11 months. At multiple time points throughout the study, OGTTs were performed and beta cell area and long-term survival were evaluated. RESULTS: Beta cell function and CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance were significantly improved by CHEMICALNOTIN with both diets. In contrast, in spite of the long treatment period, beta cell area was not significantly different between CHEMICALNOTIN-treated mice and controls. Mice of advanced age chronically fed an HFD displayed clear and extensive pancreatic inflammation and peri-insulitis, mainly formed by CD3-positive T cells, which were completely prevented by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Chronic CHEMICALNOTIN treatment also improved survival rates for HFD-fed mice. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: In a unique advanced-aged HFD-induced-obesity mouse model, GENENOTIN secretion was improved and the extensive peri-insulitis prevented by chronic GENENOTIN inhibition. The improved survival rates for obese mice chronically treated with CHEMICALIN suggest that chronic GENEIN inhibition potentially results in additional quality-adjusted life-years for individuals with type 2 diabetes, which is the primary goal of any diabetes therapy.
23639187	Amelioration of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced GENENOTIN resistance in C2C12 muscle cells by rooibos (Aspalathus linearis). Increased levels of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), specifically CHEMICALNOTIN such as CHEMICALNOTIN are associated with GENENOTIN resistance of muscle, fat and liver. Skeletal muscle, responsible for up to 80% of the CHEMICALNOTIN disposal from the peripheral circulation, is particularly vulnerable to increased levels of saturated CHEMICALNOTIN. Rooibos (Aspalathus linearis) and its unique CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, shown to reduce hyperglycemia in diabetic rats, could play a role in preventing or ameliorating the development of GENENOTIN resistance. This study aims to establish whether rooibos can ameliorate experimentally-induced GENENOTIN-resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced insulin resistant C2C12 cells were treated with an CHEMICALNOTIN-enriched green (unfermented) rooibos extract (GRE), previously shown for its blood CHEMICALNOTIN lowering effect in vitro and in vivo or an aqueous extract of fermented rooibos (FRE). CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and mitochondrial activity were measured using CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN assays, respectively. Expression of proteins relevant to CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism was analysed by Western blot. GRE contained higher levels of all compounds, except the enolic CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Both rooibos extracts increased CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, mitochondrial activity and CHEMICALNOTIN production. Compared to FRE, GRE was more effective at increasing CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and CHEMICALNOTIN production. At a mechanistic level both extracts down-regulated GENENOTIN activation, which is associated with CHEMICALNOTIN-induced GENENOTIN resistance. Furthermore, the extracts increased activation of key regulatory proteins (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) involved in GENENOTIN-dependent and non-GENENOTIN regulated signalling pathways. Protein levels of the GENEIN (GENEIN) involved in CHEMICALIN transport via these two pathways were also increased. This in vitro study therefore confirms that rooibos can ameliorate CHEMICALNOTIN-induced GENENOTIN resistance in C2C12 skeletal muscle cells. Inhibition of GENENOTIN activation and increased activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN offer a plausible mechanistic explanation for this ameliorative effect.
23639192	CHEMICALIN stimulates proliferation and differentiation and protects against cell death in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells via GENEIN-dependent GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN activation. CHEMICALNOTIN, the main CHEMICALNOTIN found in the Chinese herb radix of Pueraria lobata (Willd.) Ohwi, has received increasing attention because of its possible role in the prevention of osteoporosis. Previously, we showed that CHEMICALNOTIN could inhibit the bone absorption of osteoclasts and promote long bone growth in fetal mouse in vitro. Further study confirmed that CHEMICALNOTIN stimulated proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts in rat. However, the mechanisms underlying its actions on human bone cells have not been well defined. Here we show that CHEMICALIN increases proliferation and differentiation and opposes CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis in human osteoblastic MG-63 cells containing two GENEIN (GENEIN) isoforms. CHEMICALNOTIN promotes proliferation by altering cell cycle distribution whereas CHEMICALIN-mediated survival may be associated with up-regulation of GENEIN expression. Treatment with the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN abolishes the above actions of CHEMICALIN on osteoblast-derived cells. Using small interfering double-stranded RNA technology, we further demonstrate that the effects of CHEMICALIN on proliferation, differentiation and survival are mediated by both GENEIN and GENEIN. Moreover, we also demonstrate that CHEMICALIN functions at least partially through activation of GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN signaling. This agent also shows much weaker effect on breast epithelial cell growth than that of CHEMICALNOTIN. Therefore, CHEMICALNOTIN will be a promising agent that prevents or retards osteoporosis.
23639248	Bone Morphogenetic Protein-7 inhibits silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis in rats. Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7) has been shown to inhibit liver and renal fibrosis in in vivo and in vitro studies. There is no study to investigate BMP-7's role in the development of pulmonary fibrosis induced by silica. In the current study, we used the rat model to explore the potential antifibrotic role of BMP-7 and its underlying mechanism in silica-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Sixty Wistar rats were randomly assigned into three groups. Control group received saline, silica group received silica and BMP-7 treated group received silica and BMP-7. BMP-7 was administered to silica-treated rats intraperitoneally at a dose of 300μg/kg/injection from day 8 to day 30 every other day. After the animals were sacrificed on day 15 and 30, hydroxyproline levels, the protein expressions of BMP/Smad and TGF-β/Smad signaling, and histopathology in lung tissues were analyzed. The hydroxyproline contents in BMP-7 treated groups were significantly lower than the silica groups (P<0.05). Histopathological results showed BMP-7 could reduce the progression of silica induced fibrosis. Furthermore, the expression of p-Smad1/5/8, a marker of BMP/Smad signaling, was significantly up-regulated in BMP-7 treated groups (P<0.05) compared with the silica groups. On the contrary, the expression of p-Smad2/3, a marker for TGF-β/Smad signaling, reduced significantly in BMP-7-treated groups compared with silica groups (P<0.05). In conclusion, the pulmonary fibrosis induced by silica in rats was significantly reduced with the therapeutic treatment of BMP-7. The antifibrotic effect of BMP-7 could be related to the activation of BMP/Smad signaling and inhibition of TGF-β/Smad pathways.
23639572	The preventive effect of uncarboxylated GENENOTIN against CHEMICALIN-induced endothelial apoptosis through the activation of GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway: GENENOTIN and endothelial apoptosis. OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence suggests that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), one of the GENENOTIN, has been associated with atherosclerosis, but results are conflicting. The aim of this study was to elucidate the independent effect of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), an active form of GENENOTIN which has been suggested to have an GENENOTIN sensitizing effect, on vascular endothelial cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used human aortic endothelial cells and treated them with GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (LA) was used as a representative CHEMICALNOTIN. Apoptosis was evaluated using various methods including a terminal GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN nick-end labeling analysis kit and Western blotting for cleaved GENENOTIN, cleaved GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The phosphorylations of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as well as the level of CHEMICALNOTIN were measured to confirm the effect of GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN signaling pathway. RESULTS: Pretreatment of GENENOTIN (30ng/ml) prevented LA-induced apoptosis in GENENOTIN-stimulated endothelial cells; effects were abolished by pretreatment with the GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. Treatment of GENENOTIN (ranged from 0.3 to 30ng/ml) significantly increased the phosphorylation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN secretion from endothelial cells in a GENENOTIN dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to demonstrate the independent effect of GENENOTIN on vascular endothelial cells. Our results further suggest that GENENOTIN could have beneficial effects on atherosclerosis.
23640471	Free volume in ionic liquids: a connection of experimentally accessible observables from PALS and PVT experiments with the molecular structure from XRD data. In the current work, free volume concepts, primarily applied to glass formers in the literature, were transferred to ionic liquids (ILs). A series of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium ([C4MIM](+)) based ILs was investigated by Positron Annihilation Lifetime Spectroscopy (PALS). The phase transition and dynamic properties of the ILs [C4MIM][X] with [X](-) = [Cl](-), [BF4](-), [PF6](-), [OTf](-), [NTf2](-) and [B(hfip)4](-) were reported recently (Yu et al., Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys., 2012, 14, 6856-6868). In this subsequent work, attention was paid to the connection of the free volume from PALS (here the mean hole volume, 〈vh〉) with the molecular structure, represented by volumes derived from X-ray diffraction (XRD) data. These were the scaled molecular volume Vm,scaled and the van der Waals volume Vvdw. Linear correlations of 〈vh〉 at the "knee" temperature (〈vh〉(Tk)) with Vm,scaled and Vvdw gave good results for the [C4MIM](+) series. Further relationships between volumes from XRD data with the occupied volume Vocc determined from PALS/PVT (Pressure Volume Temperature) measurements and from Sanchez-Lacombe Equation of State (SL-EOS) fits were elaborated (Vocc(SL-EOS) ≈ 1.63 Vvdw, R(2) = 0.981 and Vocc(SL-EOS) ≈ 1.12 Vm,scaled, R(2) = 0.980). Finally, the usability of Vm,scaled was justified in terms of the Cohen-Turnbull (CT) free volume theory. Empirical CT type plots of viscosity and electrical conductivity showed a systematic increase in the critical free volume with molecular size. Such correlations allow descriptions of IL properties with the easily accessible quantity Vm,scaled within the context of the free volume.
23640884	Distinct role of PYK2 in mediating thromboxane generation downstream of both G12/13 and integrin αiibβ in platelets. Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (Pyk2) is activated by various agonists in platelets. We evaluated the signaling mechanism and the functional role of Pyk2 in platelets by using pharmacological inhibitors and Pyk2-deficient platelets. We found that platelet aggregation and secretion in response to 2-MeSADP and AYPGKF were diminished in the presence of Pyk2 inhibitors or in Pyk2-deficient platelets, suggesting that Pyk2 plays a positive regulatory role in platelet functional responses. It has been shown that ADP-, but not thrombin-, induced thromboxane (TxA2) generation depends on integrin signaling. Unlike ADP, thrombin activates G12/13 pathways, and G12/13 pathways can substitute for integrin signaling for TxA2 generation. We found that Pyk2 was activated downstream of both G12/13 and integrin-mediated pathways, and both 2-MeSADP- and AYPGKF-induced TxA2 generation was significantly diminished in Pyk2-deficient platelets. In addition, TxA2 generation induced by co-stimulation of Gi and Gz pathways, which is dependent on integrin signaling, was inhibited by blocking Pyk2. Furthermore, inhibition of 2-MeSADP-induced TxA2 generation by fibrinogen receptor antagonist was not rescued by co-stimulation of G12/13 pathways in the presence of Pyk2 inhibitor. We conclude that Pyk2 is a common signaling effector downstream of both G12/13 and integrin αIIbβ3 signaling which contributes to thromboxane generation.
23643725	The use of antioxidant enzymes in freshwater biofilms: Temporal variability vs. toxicological responses. This study aims to investigate the potential of antioxidant enzyme activities (AEA) as biomarkers of oxidative stress in freshwater biofilms. Therefore, biofilms were grown in channels for 38 days and then exposed to different concentrations (0-150μgL(-1)) of the herbicide CHEMICALNOTIN for 5 more weeks. Under control conditions, the AEA of biofilms were found to change throughout time with a significant increase in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity during the exponential growth and a more important role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activities during the slow growth phase. Chronic exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN led to slight variations in AEA, however, the ranges of variability of AEA in controls and exposed communities were similar, highlighting the difficulty of a direct interpretation of AEA values. After 5 weeks of exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN, no clear effects were observed on CHEMICALNOTIN concentration or on the composition of other pigments suggesting that algal group composition was not affected. Eukaryotic communities were structured clearly by toxicant concentration and both eukaryotic and bacterial richness were reduced in communities exposed to the highest concentration. In addition, during acute exposure tests performed at the end of the chronic exposure, biofilms chronically exposed to 75 and 150μgL(-1) CHEMICALIN showed a higher GENEIN activity than controls. Chronic exposure to CHEMICALIN provoked then structural changes but also functional changes in the capacity of biofilm GENEIN activity to respond to a sudden increase in concentration, suggesting a selection of species with higher antioxidant capacity. This study highlighted the difficulty of interpretation of AEA values due to their temporal variation and to the absence of absolute threshold value indicative of oxidative stress induced by contaminants. Nevertheless, the determination of AEA pattern throughout acute exposure test is of high interest to compare oxidative stress levels undergone by different biofilm communities and thus determine their antioxidant capacity.
23643745	Pharmacological and genetic evidence for pre- and postsynaptic GENENOTIN involvement in motor responses to GENENOTIN ligands. A combined pharmacological and genetic approach was undertaken to investigate the contribution of endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN to the motor actions of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) ligands. Motor activity was evaluated by a battery of behavioural tests in mice. The involvement of the various GENENOTIN subtypes in the motor effects of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN antagonists was evaluated pharmacologically, using GENEIN/GENEIN (CHEMICALIN), GENEIN/GENEIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) and GENEIN (CHEMICALIN) receptor antagonists, and by using GENENOTIN knockout mice. Low doses of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN antagonists promoted movement whereas higher doses inhibited it. Motor facilitation was selectively prevented by CHEMICALNOTIN while motor inhibition was prevented by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN also attenuated the hypolocomotion induced by the GENENOTIN agonist CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN precursor CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN (and CHEMICALNOTIN) worsened it. To dissect out the contribution of pre- and postsynaptic GENENOTIN, mice lacking the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN(-/-)) or its long isoform (GENENOTIN(-/-)) were used. Motor facilitation induced by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN antagonists was lost in GENENOTIN(-/-) and GENENOTIN(-/-) mice whereas motor inhibition induced by GENENOTIN antagonists (and CHEMICALNOTIN) was lost in GENENOTIN(-/-) but preserved in GENENOTIN(-/-) mice. GENENOTIN-induced hypolocomotion was observed in both genotypes. We demonstrate that motor actions of GENENOTIN ligands rely on the modulation of endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN. Motor facilitation induced by GENENOTIN antagonists as well as low dose GENENOTIN is mediated through GENENOTIN postsynaptic receptors whereas motor inhibition observed with higher doses of GENENOTIN occurs by direct inhibition of mesencephalic DA neurons. Motor inhibition seen with high doses of GENENOTIN antagonists appears to be mediated through the GENENOTIN. These data confirm that endogenous GENENOTIN is a powerful modulator of dopamine transmission in vivo and that the effects of GENENOTIN antagonists on motor function reflect the blockade of this endogenous GENENOTIN tone.
23643747	CHEMICALIN promotes GENEIN-dependent phosphorylation of GENEIN via GENEIN and inhibition of GENEIN. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a component of the small GENENOTIN, involved in multiple physiological functions. Here, we examined the effects produced by CHEMICALNOTIN, a typical antipsychotic drug, on the phosphorylation of GENENOTIN at CHEMICALNOTIN240/244 in the striatum, a brain region involved in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Administration of CHEMICALIN increased CHEMICALNOTIN240/244 phosphorylation in a subpopulation of CHEMICALNOTIN-ergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which express GENEIN (GENEIN). This effect was prevented by CHEMICALIN, an inhibitor of the GENEIN (GENEIN), or by CHEMICALIN, a selective inhibitor of the GENEIN (GENEIN). We also found that the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN240/244 phosphorylation was prevented by functional inactivation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), an endogenous inhibitor of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). In line with this observation, incubation of striatal slices with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, two inhibitors of GENEIN, increased CHEMICALNOTIN240/244 phosphorylation. These results show that CHEMICALIN promotes GENEIN- and GENEIN-dependent phosphorylation of GENEIN at CHEMICALIN240/244, in a subpopulation of striatal MSNs expressing GENEIN. They also indicate that this effect is exerted by suppressing dephosphorylation at CHEMICALNOTIN240/244, through GENENOTIN-dependent activation of GENENOTIN and inhibition of GENENOTIN.
23644191	Designing, structural elucidation, comparison of DNA binding, cleavage, radical scavenging activity and anticancer activity of copper(I) complex with 5-dimethyl-2-phenyl-4-[(pyridin-2-ylmethylene)-amino]-1,2-dihydro-pyrazol-3-one Schiff base ligand. A novel copper(I) Schiff base complex has been synthesized and fully characterized by spectral, analytical and structural modes. Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies revealed that the copper(I) complex [CuCl(PPh3)L] has a distorted tetrahedral geometry around the central copper(I) ion. The interaction of the ligand and the complex with CT-DNA has been explored by absorption titration method which revealed that the compounds could interact with CT-DNA through intercalation. A gel electrophoresis assay demonstrated the ability of the complex to cleave the pBR322 DNA. The antioxidative properties showed that the copper(I) complex has a strong radical-scavenging potency than ligands. Further the cytotoxic effect of the compounds examined on cancerous cell lines showed that the complex exhibited substantial anticancer activity.
23644213	Low molecular weight dual inhibitors of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN binding to GENENOTIN with highly overlapped pharmacophores. Dual antithrombotic agents acting as anticoagulants and aggregation inhibitors could have substantial advantages over currently prescribed combinations of antithrombotic drugs. Herein, we report compounds with moderate inhibitory activity for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN binding (both in the micromolar range). These compounds resulted from our efforts to merge the pharmacophores of selective GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN with a mimic of the CHEMICALIN (GENENOTIN) sequence of GENEIN to obtain designed multiple ligands with potential antithrombotic activity. Resulting from this study, a structurally novel class of submicromolar fibrinogen GENEIN binding inhibitor bearing CHEMICALIN moiety is also described.
23645211	Role of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative stress, neuronal damage, and apoptosis in rats. The present study was carried out to evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN (QE) in protecting the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced neuronal injury in frontal cortex of rats. A total of 30 adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups of 10 animals each: control, CHEMICALNOTIN treated and CHEMICALNOTIN treated with QE. The CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group was injected subcutaneously with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) dissolved in saline at a dose of 2 ml/kg/day for 30 days, resulting in a dosage of 1 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN. The rats in QE-treated groups were given QE (15 mg/kg body weight) once a day intraperitoneally starting 2 days prior to CHEMICALNOTIN injection, during the study period. Rats were sacrificed at the end of the study and the frontal cortex tissues were removed for biochemical and histopathological investigation. To date, there is no available information on the effect of QE on neuronal injury after CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. Rats intoxicated with CHEMICALIN for 30 days, significantly increased tissue CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels and significantly decreased enzymatic antioxidants GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in the frontal cortex tissue. Administration of QE with CHEMICALNOTIN significantly diminished the levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and significantly elevated the levels of enzymatic antioxidants in the frontal cortex tissue. The histopathological studies in the brain of rats also supported that QE markedly reduced the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced histopathological changes and well preserved the normal histological architecture of the frontal cortex tissue. The GENEIN immunopositivity was increased in degenerating neurons of the CHEMICALIN group. Treatment with QE markedly reduced the immunoreactivity of degenerating neurons. In conclusion, the results of the current study suggest that QE may be beneficial in combating the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxicity in the brain of rats. We believe that further preclinical research into the utility of QE may indicate its usefulness as a potential treatment for neurodegeneration after CHEMICALNOTIN exposure in rats.
23645248	CHEMICALNOTIN action on thyroid progenitor cells: relevant for the pathogenesis of thyroid nodules? Benign and malignant thyroid nodules are more prevalent in females than in men. Experimental data suggest that the proliferative effect of CHEMICALNOTIN rather than polymorphisms is responsible for this gender difference. This study analysed whether both differentiated thyroid cells and thyroid stem and progenitor cells are a target of CHEMICALNOTIN action. In thyroid stem/progenitor cells derived from nodular goitres the ability of CHEMICALNOTIN to induce thyrosphere formation, the expression of GENENOTIN and the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on growth, expression of marker of stem cells and thyroid differentiation (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN expression) were analysed. CHEMICALNOTIN induced thyrosphere formation, albeit to lower extent than other growth factors. Thyroid stem and progenitor cells expressed GENENOTIN with an 8 time higher expression level of GENENOTIN mRNA compared to differentiated thyrocytes. CHEMICALNOTIN was a potent stimulator of thyroid stem/ progenitor cell growth. In contrast, TSH-induced differentiation of progenitor cells, in particular the expression of the GENEIN, was significantly inhibited by CHEMICALIN.In conclusion, CHEMICALNOTIN stimulated growth and simultaneously inhibited differentiation of thyroid nodules derived stem/progenitor cells. From these data and based on the concept of cellular heterogeneity, we hypothesize a supportive role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the propagation of thyroid stem/progenitor cells leading to a selection of a progeny of growth-prone cells with a decreased differentiation. These cells may be the origin of hypo- or non-functioning thyroid nodules in females.
23645360	Differential regulation of GENENOTIN gene expression and RNA editing in non-photosynthetic tissues. RNA editing is one of the post-transcriptional processes that commonly occur in GENENOTIN and mitochondria. In Arabidopsis, 34 C-to-U RNA editing events, affecting transcripts of 18 GENENOTIN genes, have been identified. Here, we examined the editing and expression of these transcripts in different organs, and in green and non-green seedlings (etiolated, cia5-2, ispF and ispG albino mutants, CHEMICALNOTIN-, and CHEMICALNOTIN-treated). The editing efficiency of GENENOTIN transcripts varies from site to site, and may be specifically regulated in different tissues. Steady state levels of GENENOTIN transcripts are low or undetectable in etiolated seedlings, but most editing sites are edited with efficiencies similar to those observed in green seedlings. By contrast, the editing of some sites is completely lost or significantly reduced in other non-green tissues; for instance, the editing of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN is completely lost in roots and in CHEMICALIN-treated seedlings. The editing of GENEIN is also completely lost in albino mutants and CHEMICALIN-treated seedlings. However, matK-640 is completely edited, and GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN are completely or highly edited in both green and non-green tissues. In addition, the expression of nucleus-encoded GENEIN dependent transcripts is specifically induced by CHEMICALIN, and the splicing of GENEIN transcripts is significantly reduced in the albino mutants and inhibitor-treated seedlings. Our results indicate that GENENOTIN gene expression, and the splicing and editing of GENENOTIN transcripts are specifically and differentially regulated in various types of non-green tissues.
23703578	Drug-drug interactions between GENENOTIN inhibitors (statins) and antiviral GENENOTIN inhibitors. The GENENOTIN inhibitors are a class of drugs also known as statins. These drugs are effective and widely prescribed for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and prevention of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Seven statins are currently available: CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Although these drugs are generally well tolerated, skeletal muscle abnormalities from myalgia to severe lethal rhabdomyolysis can occur. Factors that increase statin concentrations such as drug-drug interactions can increase the risk of these adverse events. Drug-drug interactions are dependent on statins' pharmacokinetic profile: CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are metabolized through GENEIN, while the metabolism of the other statins is independent of this GENENOTIN. All statins are substrate of GENENOTIN, an uptake transporter expressed in hepatocyte membrane that may also explain some drug-drug interactions. Many HIV-infected patients have dyslipidemia and comorbidities that may require statin treatment. GENENOTIN inhibitors (HIV PIs) are part of recommended antiretroviral treatment in combination with two GENENOTIN inhibitors. All HIV PIs except CHEMICALNOTIN are coadministered with a low dose of CHEMICALIN, a potent GENEIN inhibitor to improve their pharmacokinetic properties. Cobicistat is a new potent GENENOTIN inhibitor that is combined with elvitegravir and will be combined with HIV-PIs in the future. The HCV-PIs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are both, to different extents, inhibitors of GENEIN. This review summarizes the pharmacokinetic properties of statins and PIs with emphasis on their metabolic pathways explaining clinically important drug-drug interactions. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN metabolized through GENEIN have the highest potency for drug-drug interaction with potent GENEIN inhibitors such as CHEMICALIN- or CHEMICALIN-boosted HIV-PI or the hepatitis C virus (HCV) PI, CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN, and therefore their coadministration is contraindicated. CHEMICALIN is also a GENEIN substrate, but less potent drug-drug interactions have been reported with GENENOTIN inhibitors. Non-GENENOTIN-dependent statin concentrations are also affected although to a lesser extent when coadministered with HIV or HCV PIs, mainly through interaction with GENENOTIN, and treatment should start with the lowest available statin dose. Effectiveness and occurrence of adverse effects should be monitored at regular time intervals.
23742252	Synthesis, structure-activity relationships, and in vivo efficacy of the novel potent and selective GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) currently in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials. The synthesis, preclinical profile, and in vivo efficacy in rat xenograft models of the novel and selective GENEIN inhibitor 15b (CHEMICALIN) are described. In this initial report, preliminary structure-activity relationships (SARs) are described as well as the rational design strategy employed to overcome the development deficiencies of the first generation GENEIN inhibitor 4 (CHEMICALIN). Compound 15b is currently in phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials with substantial antitumor activity being observed in GENENOTIN-positive cancer patients.
2450203	CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, limit high frequency repetitive firing of action potentials of spinal cord neurons in cell culture. Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on sustained repetitive firing at high frequency (SRF) of action potentials of mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture were examined using intracellular recording techniques. In control medium neurons responded to depolarizing current pulses with SRF. Limitation of SRF was produced by the anticonvulsant CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) at low to mid nanomolar concentrations, by a convulsant CHEMICALIN which does not bind to high affinity GENEIN (CHEMICALIN) at high nanomolar concentrations and by a GENEIN weak partial agonist (CHEMICALIN) at micromolar concentrations. The limitation of SRF was accompanied by use- and voltage-dependent reduction of maximal rate of rise (Vmax) of CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent action potentials. Partial agonist and inverse agonist beta CCs did not limit SRF at concentrations up to 200 nM. The limitation of SRF by CHEMICALIN was not prevented by inverse or partial agonists at the GENEIN, including CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN. These findings suggest that limitation of SRF was produced by binding of CHEMICALIN, but not CHEMICALIN, to GENEIN and not to high affinity central GENEIN, and that CHEMICALIN limit SRF by slowing recovery of GENEIN from inactivation. We propose that the limitation of SRF may contribute to the efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN against generalized tonic-clonic seizures and status epilepticus.
2521824	CHEMICALNOTIN directly stimulate proliferation of bone cells in vitro. This report describes the first observation of a direct mitogenic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on isolated osteoblastic cells in serum-free culture. CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation into DNA and cell counts were used as measures of cell proliferation. The percentage of cells that stained for GENENOTIN was used as a measure of differentiation. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) enhanced mouse osteoblastic cell proliferation in a dose dependent manner over a wide range of doses (10(-8) to 10(-11) molar), and was maximally active at 10(-9) M. CHEMICALNOTIN also stimulated proliferation in human osteoblast cell cultures and in cultures of the human osteosarcoma cell line, TE89. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (a synthetic androgenic CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (an anabolic CHEMICALNOTIN) were also mitogenic in the mouse bone cell system. The mitogenic effect of CHEMICALIN on bone cells was inhibited by antiandrogens (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) which compete for binding to the GENEIN. In addition to effects on cell proliferation, CHEMICALIN increased the percentage of GENEIN (GENEIN) positive cells in all three bone cell systems tested, and this effect was inhibited by antiandrogens. We conclude that CHEMICALIN can stimulate human and murine osteoblastic cell proliferation in vitro, and induce expression of the GENEIN GENEIN, presumably by an GENEIN mediated mechanism.
2569356	The effect of GENEIN antagonism with CHEMICALIN on concentration-related CHEMICALNOTIN-induced bronchoconstriction in asthma. Selective GENENOTIN antagonists inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced bronchoconstriction by greater than 80% when expressed as a percentage inhibition of the FEV1 time-response curve following inhalation of the provocation concentration of CHEMICALNOTIN required to produce a 20% decrease in FEV1 from baseline (PC20). To investigate this further we have determined that, in eight mild atopic asthmatic subjects, CHEMICALNOTIN (180 mg), administered 3 hr pre-challenge, increases the geometric mean PC20 for CHEMICALNOTIN from 0.4 (range 0.03-3) mg/ml after placebo, to 20.2 (range 0.6-64) mg/ml following active treatment (P less than 0.0001). For CHEMICALNOTIN, the PC20 increased from 9.3 (range 1.0-113.3) mg/ml after placebo, to 150.2 (range 32.1-1177.7) mg/ml with CHEMICALNOTIN (P less than 0.0001). This 16.2-fold (range, 5.5-47.9) displacement to the right of the CHEMICALNOTIN concentration-response curve by a selective GENENOTIN antagonist emphasizes the central role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the airways response to this nucleotide.
25802231	CHEMICALNOTIN: a review of its use in patients with mantle cell lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a first-in-class, potent, orally administered, covalent inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN) that inhibits GENEIN signalling downstream of GENEIN. Oral CHEMICALIN is indicated for the treatment of patients with relapsed/refractory mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) and for the treatment of patients with CLL and a chromosome 17 deletion (del 17p) or GENEIN mutation. This article summarizes pharmacological, efficacy and tolerability data relevant to the use of CHEMICALNOTIN in these indications. In clinical studies, CHEMICALNOTIN induced a high overall response rate in patients with relapsed/refractory MCL (phase II study). In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN significantly prolonged progression-free survival and significantly improved the partial response rate and overall survival in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL (RESONATE study), including in those with del 17p, a subgroup with a poor prognosis. CHEMICALNOTIN had an acceptable tolerability profile in these studies with <10% of patients discontinuing treatment because of adverse events. Given its efficacy and tolerability, once-daily, oral CHEMICALIN is an emerging treatment option for patients with relapsed/refractory MCL or CLL and CLL patients with del 17p or GENEIN mutation.
2859531	Effects of GENENOTIN antagonist administration on GENENOTIN density in human lymphocytes. The role of the "intrinsic sympathomimetic activity". Abrupt withdrawal of GENENOTIN antagonists may lead to "rebound-effects". To study the mechanism underlying this phenomenon, the effects of the nonselective GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN [no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA)], CHEMICALIN (weak ISA) and CHEMICALIN (strong ISA) on lymphocyte GENENOTIN density--assessed by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) binding--and plasma GENENOTIN activity (PRA) were investigated in male healthy volunteers aged 23-35 years. CHEMICALIN treatment (4 X 40 mg/day) increased the density of GENEIN by 25% after 2 days; concomitantly PRA and heart rate were reduced. During treatment GENENOTIN density remained elevated. After withdrawal of CHEMICALNOTIN PRA reached pre-drug levels rapidly, while heart rate was significantly enhanced. GENENOTIN density, however, declined slowly being still significantly increased after 3 days, although CHEMICALNOTIN was not detectable in plasma after 24 h. The affinity of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN was not changed during or after treatment. CHEMICALIN treatment (2 X 5 mg/day) caused a 30% decrease of GENEIN density and PRA after 2 days; both parameters remained reduced during treatment. After withdrawal, PRA reached rapidly pre-drug levels, whereas GENENOTIN density was still after 4 days significantly diminished. The KD-values for CHEMICALNOTIN, however, were not changed. During and after treatment heart rate was not affected. CHEMICALIN treatment (4 X 100 mg/day) led to a rapid fall in PRA, but did not significantly affect GENEIN density. It is concluded, that the ISA may play an important role in modulating GENENOTIN density and hence tissue responsiveness to GENENOTIN stimulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2882965	Inhibition of GENEIN pathway of CHEMICALIN metabolism in human neutrophils by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. The possible effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN on endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN release and metabolism was studied in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). A new in vitro assay was used by which CHEMICALNOTIN is incorporated by purified peripheral PMNs until steady state was obtained (5 hr). After preincubation with the test drugs prior to activation with CHEMICALNOTIN, the released CHEMICALNOTIN were isolated by extraction and thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and quantitated by autoradiography and laser densitometry. Median drug concentrations needed for 50% inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) release was 4-5 mM (range 1-9 mM) for both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN was ineffective. The present data suggest that inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN lipoxygenation may be an essential action of CHEMICALNOTIN and its active metabolite, CHEMICALNOTIN. Interference with GENEIN enzymes, rather than a CHEMICALIN-like inhibition of CHEMICALIN release from intracellular phospholipids, seems to be the mode of action.
2888789	CHEMICALIN: a GENEIN antagonist with unique additional actions. UNLABELLED: CHEMICALIN is a GENEIN antagonist that has been shown to be as effective as other beta blockers for the treatment of angina pectoris and hypertension. Some interesting additional properties, such as the absence of the side effect of cold extremities, required investigation, and a great deal of new evidence has been accumulated during the last three years. This new data is consistent with the proposal put forward a couple of years ago that bevantolol interacts with GENENOTIN. All the available evidence, published and unpublished, has been reviewed and fits into a coherent pattern, here arranged into five sections. Chemistry: affinity for GENENOTIN. Animal experiments confirm both agonist and antagonist effects on alpha-receptors, in addition to antagonist activity at GENENOTIN. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN has electrophysiologic effects, including bradycardia by a direct action on the sinus node and a class 1 antiarrhythmic action. Investigations in humans have shown that although CHEMICALNOTIN has a short half-life, good control of hypertension can be achieved on once-a-day dosing. SAFETY: CHEMICALNOTIN has remarkably few side effects, does not cause cold extremities, and does not significantly affect glomerular filtration rate in patients with renal impairment. Evidence has been obtained in man for interaction with GENEIN in the brain; and in the peripheral circulation CHEMICALIN does not, as do other beta blockers, increase peripheral vascular resistance, but reduces it. It is suggested that all the additional actions of CHEMICALIN can be attributed to a partial agonist action on GENEIN.
2889803	GENEIN binding of CHEMICALIN in vivo: increased receptor number with low-dose CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN are in clinical use as hypnotics and anxiolytics. We analyzed in vivo receptor binding and brain concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Drug concentrations measured in the cerebral cortex 1 h after administration were directly proportional to dose for all three compounds. In vivo receptor binding, as defined by the specific uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN, decreased with increasing doses of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, a finding indicating dose-related increases in receptor occupancy due to these compounds. CHEMICALNOTIN was substantially more potent, with an IC50 value of 16 ng/g, compared with 117 ng/g for CHEMICALNOTIN. At higher doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (greater than 0.2 mg/kg), receptor binding by CHEMICALNOTIN, likewise decreased with increasing dose of the former drug. However, at lower doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.02-0.05 mg/kg), which resulted in cortex concentrations of 2-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased above control values in cortex, hypothalamus, and hippocampus but not in several other brain regions. Binding returned to control values at doses of greater than or equal to 0.01 mg/kg. Similar results were obtained in time course studies. At 8 and 10 h after a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p., corresponding to cortex concentrations of 2.7-7 ng/g, receptor binding was increased compared with controls. Similarly, at 1, 2, and 3 h after a single dose of 0.05 mg/kg, corresponding to cortex concentrations of 3.7-5.8 ng/g, receptor binding was also increased. The apparent affinity of GENEIN for CHEMICALIN in mice receiving CHEMICALIN (0.05 mg/kg) was unchanged from that in untreated control mice, an observation suggesting that low doses of CHEMICALIN increased receptor number.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2899826	Muscarinic cholinergic and GENEIN binding of CHEMICALIN drug metabolites. In vitro binding affinities of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and some of their metabolites for GENEIN, GENENOTIN in rat brain were previously reported from our laboratories. The present study reports the in vitro binding affinities of the same compounds for GENEIN and for GENEIN in rat brain, using CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as radioligands. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and their metabolites had 5-30 times higher binding affinities for GENEIN than CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and their metabolites. CHEMICALIN was the most potent and CHEMICALIN the least potent of the four drugs in GENEIN binding. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN had only 10% of the potency of the parent drug in GENEIN binding, while the CHEMICALIN-metabolites of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN had about 75% of the potency of the parent drug in this binding system. Their GENEIN binding affinities indicate that metabolites may contribute to the sedative effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN.
2922761	CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hemorrhaging and bone toxicity in rats fed diets deficient in CHEMICALNOTIN. The recent increase in the clinical use of synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN compounds has led to concern of possible side effects. Some of these effects are known to be influenced by dietary levels of CHEMICALNOTIN. We therefore compared the toxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in male Sprague-Dawley rats maintained on diets containing different levels of CHEMICALNOTIN. Animals were fed either an NIH-07 diet supplemented with CHEMICALNOTIN (3.1 ppm CHEMICALNOTIN), an NIH-07 diet not supplemented with CHEMICALNOTIN, or an AIN-076 purified diet devoid of CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALIN had no effect on GENEIN times of animals fed the supplemented diet. When CHEMICALNOTIN was omitted from the diet, however, CHEMICALIN-dosed animals had elevated GENEIN times. This effect was observed as early as Day 7 and was accompanied by one confirmed hemorrhagic death. CHEMICALIN-dosed animals showed no change in GENEIN times. In the high-dose CHEMICALIN group, there was a twofold increase in GENEIN times but only after prolonged dosing. In animals fed the NIH-07 diets, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN induced multiple bone fractures at all dose levels. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN administered at the highest dose induced only one fracture in one animal. Animals fed the purified diet lost weight faster and diet sooner than those maintained on the other diets. Bone fractures were not observed in these animals because of early deaths resulting from hemorrhaging. For all CHEMICALIN-dosed groups maintained on the purified diet, changes in GENEIN times occured as early as 1 week. The order of effect was CHEMICALIN greater than CHEMICALIN greater than CHEMICALIN, with increases in GENEIN times correlating with increases in hemorrhagic deaths. Hence, the degree of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hemorrhage, but not the incidence of bone fractures, was inversely related to CHEMICALNOTIN levels in the diet. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, but not CHEMICALIN, caused a dose-dependent reduction in plasma GENEIN, an effect that correlated with CHEMICALIN-induced bone effects. In contrast, serum GENEIN was elevated in animals dosed with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN but not in those dose with CHEMICALIN. For this enzyme, the electrophoretic pattern on agarose gel showed a decrease, compared to controls, in the major isozyme in serum of CHEMICALNOTIN-dosed animals. Hence, plasma GENEIN is a better predictor of CHEMICALIN-induced bone effects than serum GENEIN.
2982865	Multiple affinity states of GENENOTIN in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells. Opiate agonist association rate is a function of receptor occupancy. The existence of multiple affinity states for the opiate receptor in neuroblastoma x glioma NG108-15 hybrid cells has been demonstrated by competition binding studies with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). In the presence of 10 mM CHEMICALNOTIN, all receptors exist in a high affinity state with Kd = 1.88 +/- 0.16 nM. Addition of 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) decreased the affinity of CHEMICALNOTIN to Kd = 8.08 +/- 0.93 nM. However, in the presence of 100 mM CHEMICALIN, which is required for opiate inhibition of GENEIN activity, analysis of competition binding data revealed three sites: the first, consisting of 17.5% of total receptor population has a Kd = 0.38 +/- 0.18 nM; the second, 50.6% of the population, has a Kd = 6.8 +/- 2.2 nM; and the third, 31.9% of the population, has a Kd of 410 +/- 110 nM. Thus, in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, a high affinity complex between receptor (R), CHEMICALNOTIN binding component (Ni), and ligand (L) was formed which was different from that formed in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN. These multiple affinity states of receptor in the hybrid cells are agonist-specific, and the percentage of total GENEIN in high affinity state is relatively constant in various concentrations of CHEMICALIN. Multiple affinity states of GENEIN can be demonstrated further by Scatchard analysis of saturation binding studies with CHEMICALIN. In the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN, analysis of CHEMICALNOTIN binding demonstrates that opiate receptor can exist in a single affinity state, with apparent Kd values of CHEMICALNOTIN in 10 mM Mg2+ = 1.75 +/- 0.28 nM and in 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN = 0.85 +/- 0.12 nM. There is a reduction of Bmax value from 0.19 +/- 0.02 nM in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN to 0.14 +/- 0.03 nM in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. In the presence of 100 mM CHEMICALNOTIN, Scatchard analysis of saturation binding of CHEMICALNOTIN reveals nonlinear plots; two-site analysis of the curves yields Kd = 0.43 +/- 0.09 and 7.9 +/- 3.2 nM. These Kd values are analogous to that obtained with competition binding studies. Again, this conversion of single site binding Scatchard plots to multiple sites binding plots in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN is restricted to CHEMICALNOTIN-agonist binding only.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
3004501	Inhibition of the GENEIN of rat basophil leukemia cells by CHEMICALIN, and synergism between CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the formation of CHEMICALNOTIN in rat basophil leukemia (RBL) cells (50% inhibitory concentration, EC50, 3 mM). Similar concentrations also inhibited the formation of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) by GENEIN, a detergent-solubilized cell free particulate enzyme from RBL cells which is capable of coupling CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALNOTIN. By contrast, the conversion of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN using enzymes from rat liver was at least ten times less sensitive to this inhibitor. The EC50 for inhibition of the GENEIN of RBL cells was directly proportional to the CHEMICALIN concentration in the incubations, ranging from 1.5 mM at 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN to over 40 mM at 500 microM CHEMICALNOTIN. Kinetic analysis revealed that the inhibition of the GENEIN reaction by CHEMICALIN was competitive with respect to CHEMICALIN. In contrast to CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALIN), which inhibits the formation of CHEMICALIN in RBL cells at the GENEIN step (EC50 5 microM), did not inhibit the GENEIN of these cells. On the other hand, low concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN, which had no demonstrable inhibitory activity on CHEMICALNOTIN formation by themselves, markedly synergized the inhibitory activity of CHEMICALNOTIN. These results are consistent with the interpretation that both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN formation but that they act on sequential steps in the biosynthetic pathway in such a manner as to synergistically interfere with the availability or utilization of CHEMICALIN in the GENEIN reaction.
3089818	Intestinal permeability and CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis in human rotaviral gastroenteritis assessed simultaneously by non-invasive differential sugar permeation. Changes in intestinal permeability and CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis have been investigated in three adults and fifteen infants with acute rotaviral gastroenteritis by differential sugar absorption. The method involves chromatographic measurement of urinary CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN excretion following combined ingestion in an iso-osmolar test solution. All patients had abnormal intestinal permeability indicated by raised urine CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN excretion, ratio of percentages recovered in 5 h, of 0.462 (0.100-1.227) mean and range, compared with 0.027 (0.008-0.052) for healthy controls (P less than 0.001). Ten patients also had urinary CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN excretion ratios raised above the normal range (0.014-0.41, mean 0.258) during their acute illness, indicating impaired intestinal CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis. Both indices had become normal 4 weeks after the acute illness, serial investigation of five patients showing that improvement was complete much earlier. Except for the short duration these changes are similar to those associated with villous atrophy in coeliac disease. The test procedure was verified with respect to intestinal CHEMICALIN hydrolysis by demonstrating a linear relationship between CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN excretion and log jejunal mucosal GENEIN activity by in vitro assay (R2 = 0.95) in a further group of subjects. Differential CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN absorption provides a non-invasive and sensitive index of small intestinal integrity of value for the interpretation of prolonged or otherwise complicated enteritis and the distinction of primary secondary intestinal GENEIN deficiency.
3134891	Characteristics of the binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN. To determine the factors that influence the interaction between CHEMICALIN and GENEIN, the binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN was determined by equilibrium dialysis under a variety of experimental conditions. This interaction was found to be similar in some respects to the interaction between CHEMICALIN and GENEIN. It was saturable, with between 1 and 2 mol of CHEMICALNOTIN bound to 1 mol of GENENOTIN. It was also dependent upon temperature, the presence of a divalent cation such as CHEMICALNOTIN, and on pH, showing maximum binding at pH 6.5 with little binding at pH values below 4.2 or above 8.0. The site at which CHEMICALIN bound to GENEIN appears to be similar to that at which certain antipsychotic agents bind, since several of them, including CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, prevented the binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN. However, in contrast to the reversible binding of most CHEMICALIN to GENEIN, CHEMICALIN bound to GENEIN irreversibly. The binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN was fairly selective in that other GENEIN agents such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN failed to bind to GENEIN when examined under the same experimental conditions. In addition, CHEMICALIN showed little or no CHEMICALIN-dependent binding to the GENEIN, GENEIN or GENEIN. The irreversible complex between CHEMICALIN and GENEIN may be useful for inhibiting certain GENEIN-dependent reactions and for studying the various biological functions of GENENOTIN.
3320565	Pharmacological and clinical studies of the antiandrogen CHEMICALNOTIN. This paper summarizes the animal and human studies with CHEMICALNOTIN available at the time of the meeting. The following was demonstrated in the rat and confirmed in man: interaction of CHEMICALIN with the GENEIN, antiandrogen activity against CHEMICALNOTIN (in particular against the early transient rise induced by GENENOTIN analogs) and adrenal CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, as shown in 4 different double blind studies performed in stage D2 prostrate cancer patients, the combination of CHEMICALNOTIN with surgical or chemical castration enhanced the beneficial effects of castration alone and thus seems a step forward in the hormonal treatment of prostatic carcinoma.
3588607	GENENOTIN: development of selective agonists and antagonists. CHEMICALNOTIN modulates a variety of physiological functions through interaction with GENENOTIN, where agonists mediate inhibition and stimulation, respectively, of GENENOTIN. In the cardiovascular system, GENENOTIN mediate vasodilation and reduction in blood pressure, while GENENOTIN mediate cardiac depression. The involvement of GENENOTIN in these responses remains unresolved. CHEMICALIN analogs in particular the CHEMICALIN-substituted compounds are more potent at GENEIN than at GENEIN. The subregion of the GENEIN that interacts with the CHEMICALIN-substituent is different for GENENOTIN, particularly with respect to CHEMICALIN interactions, bulk tolerance and stereoselectivity. A series of para-substituted CHEMICALNOTIN have been synthesized based on a "functionalized congener" approach in which a chemically reactive group, such as an CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, is introduced at the terminus of a chain. From the "functionalized congener" are synthesized a variety of conjugates each containing a common pharmacophore. Certain of the CHEMICALIN conjugates are highly selective for GENEIN. CHEMICALIN are classical antagonists for GENEIN for many of their pharmacological actions may be due to blockade of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are virtually non-selective for GENENOTIN. Replacement of the CHEMICALIN groups of CHEMICALIN with CHEMICALIN or larger CHEMICALIN groups yields CHEMICALIN with selectivity for GENEIN, particularly when combined with an CHEMICALIN moiety. Most CHEMICALNOTIN are very insoluble, but incorporation of polar CHEMICALNOTIN substituents, such as CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN to increase solubility, results in marked reduction in potency and selectivity. A new series of more hydrophilic CHEMICALNOTIN has been synthesized using the "functionalized congener" approach. Certain conjugates of CHEMICALNOTIN display A1 selectivity in biochemical and cardiovascular models. Certain analogs of CHEMICALIN in which the CHEMICALIN group at the 1- or 7-position is replaced with a propargyl or CHEMICALIN group display selectivity for GENEIN. The profile of a series of CHEMICALIN analogs or of CHEMICALIN antagonists can be used to define the nature of GENEIN.
3735252	Inhibition of testicular GENEIN from laboratory animals and man by CHEMICALIN and its isomers. The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN upon testicular cytosolic GENEIN was measured in vitro. CHEMICALIN (0-100 mumol/l) inhibited GENEIN prepared from the testes of the mouse greater than rabbit greater than human greater than rat greater than hamster. There was no relationship between inhibition and in-vivo antifertility activity. GENENOTIN activity measured in vitro in serum of men and hamsters was unaffected by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN and its isomers were non-competitive inhibitors of GENEIN with respect to the coenzyme CHEMICALIN, competitive inhibitors of GENEIN and noncompetitive-competitive inhibitors of GENEIN with respect to the substrate CHEMICALIN. Co-incubation with GENENOTIN or CHEMICALIN but not CHEMICALIN protected GENEIN from CHEMICALIN.
3917545	Inactivation of GENEIN and GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. Requirement for peroxidative metabolism. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an efficient reducing cofactor for the peroxidase activity of GENEIN (GENEIN). Most reducing cofactors for the peroxidase protect GENEIN and GENEIN from inactivation by CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, however, does not protect these enzymes, but rather augments their CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent inactivation. Using ram seminal vesicle microsomes as a source of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, we have examined the interaction of CHEMICALNOTIN and exogenous CHEMICALNOTIN. Chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of CHEMICALIN in this system revealed that CHEMICALIN-dependent inactivation of GENEIN is markedly increased in the presence of 100 microM CHEMICALIN. This inactivation is a linear function of CHEMICALNOTIN concentration between 10 and 250 microM, with a half-maximal effect in this range at about 100 microM PB. GENENOTIN is even more sensitive to inactivation by the combined CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN treatment, with a corresponding half-maximal effect at CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations near 25 microM. This CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent inactivation is demonstrable whether CHEMICALNOTIN is generated in situ from CHEMICALNOTIN or is added exogenously, supporting a direct effect of the treatment on GENENOTIN. As CHEMICALNOTIN undergoes CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent co-oxygenation catalyzed by GENENOTIN, we propose that it is an oxygenated derivative of CHEMICALNOTIN, rather than the parent compound, which is responsible for the inactivation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, a competitive inhibitor of CHEMICALNOTIN co-oxygenation, blocks the effects of the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN treatment, supporting our proposal.
3994963	Drug-protein interactions: isolation and characterization of covalent adducts of CHEMICALIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN, an alpha-adrenergic antagonist containing a CHEMICALIN group, labels GENEIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. The covalent interaction is inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN in a concentration-dependent manner. Adducts of GENEIN and CHEMICALIN were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography into four major fractions: two containing 0.6 and 1.2 mol of drug per mol of protein and two different fractions each containing 2.0 mol/mol. Each adduct had a reduced ability to activate GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and the CHEMICALIN binding capacities of the CHEMICALIN-GENEIN adducts were diminished to the extent of CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation into each adduct. Isolation and characterization of labeled peptides from CHEMICALIN-modified GENEIN indicated that peptides encompassing residues 38-75, 107-126, and 127-148 contained CHEMICALIN label. These studies directly demonstrate the relatedness between the binding activities of two structurally dissimilar GENENOTIN antagonists, demonstrate that covalent adducts of GENENOTIN and drugs with equal stoichiometries of labeling can have quantitative differences in activity and sites of modification, and provide direct evidence of distinct drug binding regions in GENENOTIN located in the amphipathic alpha-helical regions of the second and fourth domains.
6150080	GENEIN activities in brown adipose tissue of the rat: identification of CHEMICALIN-sensitive (CHEMICALIN-resistant) activity at the fat cell membrane. GENENOTIN activity, previously described in homogenates of brown adipose tissue of the rat, has now been investigated in preparations of isolated fat cells. It was found that the specific activities of both GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were higher in isolated fat cells than in the original whole tissue. Brown adipocytes therefore represent a major source of both these enzymes. In plasma membranes prepared from these isolated brown fat cells by CHEMICALIN extraction there was a similar enrichment of activity of GENEIN and of the plasma membrane marker enzyme, GENEIN. However in preparations of cell membranes made by binding the cells to polycation-coated beads, enrichment of GENENOTIN activity was much greater than that of GENENOTIN. It is suggested that the disposition of the enzyme within the cell membrane may account for the discrepancy in these results, i.e. the sidedness of the membrane may be important. Histochemical visualization of enzyme activity in whole tissue at the ultrastructural level was undertaken. Positive staining of mitochondria was achieved in the presence of the GENEIN substrate, CHEMICALIN. Staining around the edges of the brown fat cells was observed with the GENEIN substrates, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Staining was largely absent when substrate was omitted or after pretreatment with the irreversible GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN and the slowly reversible inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. It is not definitely proven that this staining represents sites of enzyme activity but the results are consistent with evidence from other studies indicating that GENENOTIN in brown adipose tissue of the rat may be found predominantly at the fat cell surface.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
6311012	GENEIN and role of CHEMICALIN in causing bacterial cell death. The activity of CHEMICALNOTIN against bacteria is in large part related to binding to specific receptor proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis. These proteins have been designated GENENOTIN. They can be separated into distinct entities through the use of CHEMICALNOTIN gel electrophoresis and binding of radioactive CHEMICALNOTIN. Six major proteins have been defined in the Enterobacteriaceae, GENENOTIN. Selection of mutants has shown that there are three essential proteins: GENENOTIN, which is divided into GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, which acts as a replacement for GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is a GENENOTIN-elongation initiating enzyme and GENENOTIN is a septal GENENOTIN-synthesizing enzyme. GENENOTIN are not essential for bacterial survival. Binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN produces lysis, binding to GENEIN produces round cells, and binding to GENEIN produces long filaments. CHEMICALIN is a CHEMICALIN derivative that binds specifically to GENEIN. The compound is more GENEIN stable than CHEMICALIN and has no major delay in entry into the periplasmic space as do some CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits most of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of some CHEMICALNOTIN-positive Proteus species, but it does not inhibit gram-positive cocci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CHEMICALNOTIN produces spherical bacterial cells that eventually lyse. Its activity in vitro is markedly affected by ionic content of media. This agent acts synergistically with many CHEMICALIN, such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and the like, and with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN to inhibit gram-negative bacilli, probably on the basis of binding to different proteins needed for the production of the GENEIN of the bacterial cell wall. CHEMICALNOTIN possesses a number of the essentials for effective antimicrobial activity and, by virtue of its enhancement of the activity of other CHEMICALNOTIN, may prove to be a useful agent in the chemotherapy of certain infections.
6319437	Loss of GENEIN and GENEIN surface binding induced by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. We have found that certain CHEMICALIN [e.g., CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)] and CHEMICALIN [e.g., CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)] induce a loss of cell-surface receptors for GENEIN, and GENEIN (GENEIN) in fibroblasts. The loss of GENENOTIN is independent of receptor occupancy and is rapidly reversed upon removal of these agents from the culture medium. The extent of GENEIN loss is less than for GENENOTIN, and the GENENOTIN do not reappear at the surface when CHEMICALIN is removed. Receptor loss was measured as a change in the capacity for binding iodinated ligands; no change in affinity of binding was observed. This receptor loss could reflect inactivation of receptors or internalization. CHEMICALIN did not induce a loss of cell surface GENEIN, a membrane protein which is excluded from coated pits and which is not internalized, indicating that the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was specific for membrane receptors and not a result of bulk depletion of plasma membrane. The loss of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN occurs at concentrations which do not cause an increase in the pH of endocytic vesicles or the cytoplasm, indicating that these agents act by a mechanism distinct from the effect of other weak bases. Since both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are potent inhibitors of GENEIN, we investigated the possibility that inhibition of GENENOTIN was responsible for the loss of receptors. Three lines of evidence suggest that GENENOTIN inhibition is not responsible for the inhibition of binding and endocytosis: 1) CHEMICALIN, a CHEMICALIN that is a poor inhibitor of calmodulin, is nearly as effective as CHEMICALIN at inhibiting endocytosis; calmidazolium, a potent inhibitor of several GENEIN functions, did not cause a loss of binding; 2) the microinjection of GENENOTIN into cells did not reverse the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN; using pressure microinjection, we introduced up to a 100-fold excess of GENENOTIN over native levels into individual gerbil fibroma cells; using CHEMICALIN-labeled GENEIN, we saw that the CHEMICALNOTIN induced inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis was the same in injected and uninjected cells; 3) we injected GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN, into cells (1-3 pg/cell) and observed no effect on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of CHEMICALIN-labeled GENEIN. These data indicated that cell surface receptor numbers can be regulated by a cellular component that is not GENENOTIN but that shares some drug sensitivities with GENENOTIN.
6621777	The effect of various CHEMICALNOTIN and drugs on the CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations in the mouse caudate nucleus. Injection of CHEMICALNOTIN (800 mg/kg, 2 h) increased the mouse striatal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) concentrations. A smaller dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (20 mg/kg, 2 h) produced a larger increase in mouse striatal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) concentrations. The administration of CHEMICALNOTIN to mice caused a slight increase in the CHEMICALNOTIN concentration in the corpus striatum after 2 h while a larger dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (800 mg/kg) produced a greater increase. Eight hours following CHEMICALNOTIN injection, CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations were still elevated. With CHEMICALNOTIN a significant increase was observed at eight hours after drug administration. Two drugs which reduce CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, decreased CHEMICALNOTIN striatal concentrations without affecting CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations. From these results, it is proposed that GENEIN activity determines CHEMICALIN concentrations by regulating CHEMICALIN availability. This enzyme may also synthesize CHEMICALNOTIN which is subsequently decarboxylated to form CHEMICALNOTIN and then oxidatively deaminated to form CHEMICALNOTIN.
6701456	Demonstration of GENENOTIN on human platelets by flow cytometry. GENENOTIN conjugated with CHEMICALNOTIN (GENENOTIN-HIS) has been used for the demonstration of GENENOTIN on human platelets. Such receptors were demonstrated on 40-63% of peripheral blood platelets in 4 healthy donors. The binding of GENEIN-HIS was inhibited on 35-79% of the platelets by the GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. The GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN blocked the GENEIN-HIS binding on 14-37% of the platelets. It is concluded that GENENOTIN as well as GENENOTIN occur on human platelets but the receptors are not equally distributed in the platelet population.
6703688	The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency on GENENOTIN isoenzymes in rat liver. Endogenous synthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN has been reported to increase in CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency probably due to defective transamination of CHEMICALNOTIN, the direct source of CHEMICALNOTIN, to CHEMICALNOTIN. GENEIN (GENEIN) in the liver catalyzes most of the CHEMICALIN transamination in mammalian tissues (E. V. Rowsell, K. Snell, J. A. Carnie, and K. V. Rowsell (1972) Biochem. J. 127, 155-165). The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency on hepatic GENENOTIN isoenzymes, designated GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively, were examined with male rats; GENENOTIN is located both in the peroxisomes and in the mitochondria, and GENENOTIN only in the mitochondria. The holo activity of combined peroxisomal and mitochondrial GENEIN with a low Km for CHEMICALIN rapidly decreased after a lag time of about 2 days during feeding of the CHEMICALNOTIN-deficient diet (by 50% in 5 days, by 86% in 14 days). Peroxisomal GENENOTIN activity was more affected than the mitochondrial. The holo activity of GENEIN with a high Km for CHEMICALIN decreased more slowly than GENEIN (by 33% in 14 days, by 60% in 28 days). Urinary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN began to increase in 8-9 days, when GENENOTIN remained intact but most of GENENOTIN is depleted. When the defect in the CHEMICALNOTIN transamination in vivo in CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency is considered, these findings suggest that it is due to the deficiency of GENENOTIN. The importance of peroxisomal GENENOTIN is discussed, since peroxisomes have been described to be probably the major site of CHEMICALNOTIN formation.
7499320	How do volatile anesthetics inhibit Ca(2+)-ATPases? Volatile anesthetics at concentrations that are used in clinical practice to induce anesthesia selectively inhibit activity of the plasma membrane Ca(2+)-transport ATPase (Kosk-Kosicka, D., and Roszczynska, G. (1993) Anesthesiology 79, 774-780). We have investigated the mechanism of the inhibitory action of several anesthetics on the purified erythrocyte Ca(2+)-ATPase by employing fluorescence spectroscopy measurements that report changes in the environment of intrinsic tryptophans and of an extrinsic probe attached in the active site of the enzyme. We have shown that the observed inhibition of the Ca(2+)-dependent activation of the enzyme correlates well with the elimination of the Ca(2+)-induced conformation change that is important for the proper function of the enzyme. Analysis of the anesthetics effects on the total tryptophan fluorescence indicates a significant effect on enzyme conformation. Similar changes have been observed in the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase. We propose that volatile anesthetics inhibit Ca(2+)-ATPase by interacting with nonpolar sites in protein interior, in analogy to the binding demonstrated for myoglobin, hemoglobin, and adenylate kinase (Schoenborn, B. P., and Featherstone, R. M. (1967) Adv. Pharmacol. 5, 1-17; Tilton, R. F., Kuntz, I. D., and Petsko, G. A. (1984) Biochemistry 23, 2849-2857). Such binding is expected to modify conformational substate(s) of the enzyme and perturb its function. We view this process as an example of a general phenomena of interaction of small molecules with internal sites in proteins.
7560228	The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on mediators of gingival inflammation. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a well-known and widely used nonionic antibacterial agent which has recently been introduced in toothpastes and mouthrinses. The efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN-containing toothpaste and mouthrinse to reduce both plaque and gingivitis in long-term clinical trials has been well documented. Until recently, it was generally assumed that triclosan's effect on gingival inflammation was due to its antimicrobial and anti-plaque effect. It has now become apparent that CHEMICALNOTIN may have a direct anti-inflammatory effect on the gingival tissues. Several in vitro studies were conducted to evaluate the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on 4 primary enzymes of the pathways of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. These pathways lead to the production of known mediators of inflammation such as the CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN inhibited both GENEIN and GENEIN with IC-50 values of 43 microM and 227 microM, respectively. CHEMICALIN also inhibited GENEIN with an IC-50 of 43 microM. The GENEIN was similarly inhibited by CHEMICALIN with an IC-50 of 61 microM. Hence, CHEMICALIN has the ability to inhibit both the GENEIN and GENEIN pathways of CHEMICALIN metabolism with similar efficacy. In cell culture experiments, it was found that CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN induced CHEMICALIN production by human gingival fibroblasts in a concentration dependent manner, and at relatively low concentrations. These data, taken together, indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN can inhibit formation of several important mediators of gingival inflammation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
7599160	The dynamics of CHEMICALNOTIN utilization in L-1210 mouse leukemia cells: a model of cellular CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. The uptake and metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been studied in L-1210 murine leukemia cells propagating in vitro. Extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (protein bound and free) and intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (protein bound and free) were determined after culturing L-1210 cells in the presence of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) bound to GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN). The intracellular pool of free CHEMICALNOTIN increased during the first 24 h of culture and a substantial fraction of this free pool was effluxed from the cell to the medium. Upon depletion of extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN, the intracellular concentration of free CHEMICALNOTIN decreased as did the efflux of CHEMICALNOTIN to the medium. Internalized CHEMICALNOTIN was converted to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN. These CHEMICALNOTIN forms were found in both soluble (cytoplasmic) and insoluble (membrane) fractions. Intracellular protein-bound CHEMICALIN fractionated with GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) activity. The major form of CHEMICALNOTIN associated with the two enzymes was CHEMICALNOTIN. Cells propagated in medium containing CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN showed a substantial increase in GENEIN activity which paralleled the increase in the intracellular concentration of CHEMICALNOTIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN bound to the enzyme.
7665369	CHEMICALIN binding and activation of GENEIN in GH4ZR7 cells. CHEMICALIN inhibition of radioligand binding to the GENEIN and CHEMICALIN inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN)-stimulated CHEMICALIN production in GH4ZR7 cells, stably transfected with a GENENOTIN, were evaluated. CHEMICALIN inhibition of the binding of the GENEIN-specific radioligand, CHEMICALIN, exhibited a KI (inhibition constant) of 6.9 +/- 2.6 nM, whereas CHEMICALIN was much less potent (370 +/- 160 nM). CHEMICALIN were also effective in inhibiting GENEIN-stimulated CHEMICALIN production, with EC50 values for CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN of 8 +/- 2, 47 +/- 2, 28 +/- 2, 2 +/- 1, and 8 +/- 1 nM, respectively. Inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN production by CHEMICALNOTIN was blocked by the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (IC50, 300 +/- 150 nM). Our results indicate that ergot compounds, especially CHEMICALIN, bind to GENEIN and elicit second messenger responses similar to that of CHEMICALIN. These findings suggest that some of the deleterious effects of consumption of endophyte-infected tall fescue, which contains several CHEMICALIN including CHEMICALIN, may be due to GENEIN activation.
7691623	Binding of antipsychotic drugs at GENENOTIN: CHEMICALIN is selective for the GENEIN. The binding of the antipsychotic drugs CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN was studied at the subtypes of the GENEIN. Saturation experiments showed that CHEMICALIN labelled a single population of binding sites in the spleen (GENEIN) and hippocampus (GENEIN and GENEIN) (dissociation constants (KD): 0.26 nM and 0.14 nM respectively). CHEMICALNOTIN displaced the radioligand in a monophasic manner in both the spleen and hippocampus whereas CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN displaced the radioligand in a monophasic manner in the spleen but in a biphasic manner in the hippocampus. The affinity of these three compounds for the low affinity site in the hippocampus was similar to that observed in the spleen, suggesting that all three were selective for the GENENOTIN. Furthermore, the affinities for the GENENOTIN calculated in this manner were in agreement with literature values. With the exception of CHEMICALIN, all the antipsychotic drugs tested failed to show selectivity for either of the GENEIN subtypes. CHEMICALIN was 120-fold more selective for the GENEIN with respect to the GENEIN (Ki values: 2.3 +/- 1.2 nM and 283.6 +/- 174.1 nM respectively).
7773533	Mediation of CHEMICALIN-induced contractions of rat aorta by the GENEIN subtype. 1. The subtypes of GENEIN mediating contractions to exogenous CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) in rat aorta have been examined in both biochemical and functional studies. 2. Incubation of rat aortic membranes with the irreversible GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN: 10 microM) did not change the KD of CHEMICALIN binding in comparison to untreated membranes, but reduced by 88% the total number of binding sites (Bmax). 3. Contractions of rat aortic strips to CHEMICALNOTIN after CHEMICALNOTIN (50 microM for 30 min) incubation followed by repetitive washing, showed a marked shift in the potency of CHEMICALNOTIN and a partial reduction in the maximum response. The residual contractions to CHEMICALNOTIN after CHEMICALNOTIN incubation were not affected by CHEMICALNOTIN (10 nM). 4. The competitive antagonists CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited contractions to CHEMICALNOTIN with estimated pA2 values of 9.85, 8.54, 9.34, 7.71, 7.64 and 8.41, respectively. 5. The affinity of the same antagonists for the GENENOTIN was evaluated by utilizing membranes from rat hippocampus pretreated with CHEMICALNOTIN, and rat liver, respectively. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were confirmed as selective for the GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN was alpha 1B-selective. 6. A significant correlation was found between the pA2 values of the GENENOTIN antagonists tested and their affinity for the GENENOTIN subtype, but not for the alpha 1A-subtype. 7. In conclusion, these findings indicate that in rat aorta most of the contraction is mediated by GENENOTIN, and that the potency (pA2) of an antagonist in this tissue should be related to its antagonistic effect on this subtype of the GENENOTIN population.
7816863	Beta 2- but not GENEIN are involved in CHEMICALIN enhancement of aggressive behavior in long-term isolated mice. The effects of several GENENOTIN antagonists on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increase in aggressive behavior in long-term isolated mice were examined. CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg/kg, IP) significantly increased the duration of aggressive behavior in isolated mice but did not significantly change the latency to the first attack consistent with our previous reports. Intraperitoneal administration of CHEMICALIN (2.5-10 mg/kg), a nonselective GENEIN antagonist, dose dependently attenuated the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced enhancement of aggressive behavior without significantly affecting the basal aggressive responses. CHEMICALIN (1.25-5 mg/kg, IP), a selective GENEIN antagonist, also blocked the desipramine-induced enhancement of aggressive behavior in a dose-dependent manner, whereas CHEMICALIN (5-20 mg/kg, IP), a selective GENEIN antagonist, did not affect it. Moreover, CHEMICALIN (0.1-0.5 mg/kg, IP), a lipophilic GENEIN agonist, significantly increased the duration of basal aggressive behavior. Taken together with our previous finding that the CHEMICALIN-induced enhancement of aggressive behavior can be blocked by CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN antagonist, the present results indicate that not only alpha 2- but also GENEIN stimulation plays important roles in modulation of aggressive behavior in long-term isolated mice.
7875228	GENENOTIN subtypes mediating the regulation and modulation of CHEMICALNOTIN sensitization in rabbit thoracic aorta. CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM), CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microM) with CHEMICALNOTIN (GTP, 50 microM) or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, 10 microM) all significantly enhanced the contraction induced by 0.3 microM CHEMICALNOTIN (pCa6.5) in beta-escin-skinned smooth muscle of rabbit thoracic aorta. The enhancement of CHEMICALNOTIN contraction produced by CHEMICALNOTIN was greater than that produced by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. In beta-escin-skinned strips of CHEMICALNOTIN-pretreated smooth muscle, the enhancement of CHEMICALNOTIN contraction produced by CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly decreased, whereas the amplitude was the same as that produced by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN; this enhancement was inhibited by the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (100 nM). The enhancement of CHEMICALNOTIN contraction produced by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was not affected by CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in the CHEMICALNOTIN-pretreated tissue were all inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, 1 mM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (H-7, 20 microM). Furthermore, the phosphorylation of GENEIN produced by CHEMICALIN was greater than that produced by CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that both GENENOTIN) increase the CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity of contractile elements, and that the CHEMICALNOTIN sensitization produced by GENENOTIN is mediated through GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and plays an important role in contraction of smooth muscle of rabbit thoracic aorta.
7926307	STZ transport and cytotoxicity. Specific enhancement in GENENOTIN-expressing cells. The CHEMICALNOTIN analog CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has long been used as a tool for creating experimental diabetes because of its relatively specific beta-cell cytotoxic effect, but the mechanism by which systemic injection of CHEMICALNOTIN causes beta-cell destruction is not well understood. In the current study, we have used insulinoma (RIN) and AtT-20ins cell lines engineered for overexpression of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN to investigate the role of GENENOTIN isoforms in mediating CHEMICALNOTIN cytotoxicity. The in vivo effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were evaluated by implantation of RIN cells expressing or lacking GENENOTIN into athymic nude rats. The drug had a potent cytotoxic effect on RIN cells expressing GENEIN, but had no effect on cells lacking GENENOTIN expression, as indicated by histological analysis and measurement of the blood CHEMICALIN levels of treated animals. The preferential cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN-expressing cell lines was confirmed by in vitro analysis of GENENOTIN-expressing and untransfected RIN cells, as well as GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN-overexpressing AtT-20ins cells. Consistent with these data, only GENEIN-expressing RIN or AtT-20ins cells transported CHEMICALIN efficiently. We conclude that expression of GENEIN is required for efficient killing of neuroendocrine cells by CHEMICALIN, and this effect is related to specific recognition of the drug as a transported substrate by GENEIN but not GENEIN.
7981624	Annexin 1 regulation in human epidermal cells. Annexin 1 (named p35, lipocortin I or calpactin II), initially described as a glucocorticoid induced protein, belongs to a new characterized family of intracellular proteins. In the skin, the role of annexins has still not been elucidated. In a previous study, we reported the localization of annexin 1 in both freshly isolated human epidermal cells and in cultured keratinocytes using immunofluorescence, FACS analysis and immunoblotting techniques. The protein was characterized by Western blot and immunoprecipitation as a 35 kDa protein. Results from in vivo studies confirmed the presence of annexin 1 in basal and suprabasal layers of normal human skin with modified reactivity patterns in hyperproliferative lesions. In the present study, the role of glucocorticoids in annexin 1 regulation was investigated in epidermal cells by Western blot and immunoprecipation assays. In contrast to other studies, we found that glucocorticoid treatment of epidermal cells led to a decrease in annexin 1 content in the cytoplasm and the membranes of cells. As annexin 1 was not detected in the nucleus of cells, we conclude that there was a down regulation of annexin 1 after glucocorticoid treatments rather than a translocation of the protein to the nucleus. Despite the absence of the signal peptide sequence necessary for protein secretion, annexin 1 was released in the keratinocyte culture medium. We found that the protein was secreted only in low Ca2+ medium (0.15 mM), this process required an active metabolism.
8073394	Inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN analogues on GENEIN induced whole blood clot lysis. The CHEMICALNOTIN analogues CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) are used to prevent excessive bleeding in patients with coagulopathies, such as hemophilia and thrombocytopenia, or in those who have received GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). However, their relative efficacy in inhibiting lysis of clots that have been formed in the presence of exogenous GENENOTIN or that have been formed and then exposed to exogenous GENENOTIN has not been well characterized. The present study utilized blood from normal volunteers and CHEMICALIN-GENEIN in a dilute whole blood clot assay to determine the relative concentrations of CHEMICALIN analogues required for inhibition of clot lysis induced by exogenous GENEIN. CHEMICALIN (0.06 mM) and CHEMICALIN (0.6 mM) were effective in prolonging clot lysis if (1) whole blood clots were formed and then exposed to a CHEMICALNOTIN analogue and exogenous GENEIN or if (2) whole blood clots were formed in the presence of exogenous GENEIN and a CHEMICALNOTIN analogue. However, their inhibitory effect was markedly reduced if clots were formed in the presence of GENEIN and then exposed to either of the CHEMICALIN analogues. The analogues did not inhibit the initial binding of GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN. They did inhibit binding of GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN as well as the activation of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN in the absence of GENENOTIN. The data suggest that CHEMICALIN analogues, even at low concentrations, reduce the rate of GENEIN induced whole blood clot lysis by several mechanisms.
8098142	CHEMICALIN enhances the depolarizing afterpotential of immunohistochemically identified CHEMICALNOTIN neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus via GENEIN activation. Previous studies have demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN primarily excites unidentified neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus. We investigated the neuromodulatory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on immunohistochemically identified CHEMICALNOTIN neurons in the rat supraoptic nucleus using intracellular recording techniques from the hypothalamo-neurohypophysial explant. Exogenous application of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1-100 microM) to vasopressinergic neurons produced a small membrane depolarization accompanied by an increase of up to 100% in the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential that follows current-evoked trains of action potentials. The enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by CHEMICALNOTIN did not depend upon the depolarization. Further, CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced the amplitude of the depolarizing afterpotential when blocking the afterhyperpolarizing potential with CHEMICALNOTIN or apamin, and in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN or apamin, indicating a postsynaptic action of CHEMICALNOTIN on the depolarizing afterpotential that is not simply a reflection of a decrease in the afterhyperpolarizing potential. These toxins also had no effect on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced depolarization. The enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential by CHEMICALNOTIN was mimicked by the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN and was reduced or blocked by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, but was not blocked or reduced in the presence of the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN. In summary, these results show that the excitatory effect of CHEMICALIN on immunohistochemically identified CHEMICALNOTIN neurons in the supraoptic nucleus is due in part to the GENEIN-mediated enhancement of the depolarizing afterpotential independent of any change in the afterhyperpolarizing potential or membrane potential.
8142113	CHEMICALNOTIN, a new chemical entity with CHEMICALNOTIN activity. CHEMICALNOTIN is a novel chemical entity which, in terms of pharmacology, behaves similar to CHEMICALNOTIN, but is chemically and photochemically stable. It has a particular selectivity profile for the known nuclear GENENOTIN with low affinity for GENENOTIN and no transactivating potential for GENENOTIN. This receptor profile could imply that CHEMICALNOTIN, in contrast to CHEMICALNOTIN, affects the terminal differentiation pathway of epidermal cells rather than their proliferation. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN does not bind to members of the cellular GENEIN family. CHEMICALNOTIN has comedolytic activity in the topical rhino mouse model. It exerts a moderate-to-potent anti-inflammatory effect in a series of in vitro and in vivo models. In comparative clinical studies involving 72 acne patients, the efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN was comparable, if not superior, to CHEMICALNOTIN, but CHEMICALNOTIN was better tolerated. The data reviewed in this paper indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN should be particularly beneficial in the treatment of acne.
8319997	Comparative effects of three different potent GENENOTIN inhibitors in primates. The goal of the present study was to compare the effects of three potent reference GENEIN inhibitors (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) in CHEMICALNOTIN-depleted normotensive squirrel monkeys. In these monkeys, arterial pressure was measured in the conscious state with a telemetry system. Oral and intravenous maximal effective doses of the three GENENOTIN inhibitors were compared in parallel groups of monkeys. In additional experiments, remikiren was given on top of either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN in the same animals. Finally, the three drugs were compared with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. The effects of the three drugs on the plasma components of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN system (plasma GENENOTIN activity, immunoreactive GENENOTIN, and immunoreactive GENENOTIN concentrations) were also measured. Our results show that CHEMICALNOTIN was as effective as CHEMICALNOTIN and markedly more effective than CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN in reducing arterial pressure in our monkey model. Interestingly, these differences in arterial pressure could not be explained by differences of in vitro potency or different biochemical changes of the plasma components of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN system, because the inhibitors all reduced immunoreactive GENENOTIN to similarly low levels. One possible explanation is that, in our model, CHEMICALIN in contrast to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN is able to inhibit GENEIN in a functionally important extraplasmatic compartment.
8384226	Inhibition of GENEIN-primed eosinophil chemotaxis by CHEMICALIN. BACKGROUND: Eosinophil influx into the lung tissue is considered to be relevant for the pathogenesis of asthma. Various chemotactic factors may be responsible for this influx. Recently it has been demonstrated that the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are present in the circulation of individuals with allergic asthma. These GENENOTIN have the capacity to modulate chemotactic responses of eosinophils toward platelet-activating factor, CHEMICALNOTIN, (CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN, but not toward GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Here the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on the chemotactic response of eosinophils from allergic asthmatic individuals and from normal donors preincubated with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN toward FMLP, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN was evaluated. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN inhibited the chemotactic response toward CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN/GENEIN of GENEIN primed eosinophils approximately 60% (inhibitory concentration of 50% [IC50] approximately 1 to 10 nmol/L), whereas these responses of GENEIN primed eosinophils was completely inhibited (IC50 approximately 1 nmol/L). CONCLUSIONS: The chemotactic responses toward GENEIN were inhibited by CHEMICALIN at higher concentrations than were required in the priming studies (IC50 approximately 10 to 100 nmol/L). CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1 mumol/L) was also effective in inhibiting the chemotactic response toward CHEMICALNOTIN (10 nmol/L) of eosinophils isolated from the circulation of patients with allergic asthma 3 hours after allergen challenge. These findings might explain in part the antiinflammatory action of CHEMICALNOTIN.
8415655	Dominant expression of mRNA for GENENOTIN in leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain. CHEMICALIN-independent GENEIN [GENEIN; GENEIN, GENEIN] is an enzyme responsible for biosynthesis of CHEMICALIN in the central nervous system. In situ hybridization with antisense RNA for the enzyme indicated that mRNA for the enzyme was predominantly expressed in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes of the adult rat brain. The findings agree with those obtained by immunohistochemical staining with antibodies against the enzyme. It was further revealed that GENENOTIN activity was considerably greater in the isolated leptomeninges (14.2 nmol per min per mg of protein) and choroid plexus (7.0 nmol per min per mg of protein) than the activity in the whole brain (2.0 nmol per min per mg of protein). These results, taken together, indicate that the enzyme is mainly synthesized and located in the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and oligodendrocytes in the brain.
8589992	cDNA cloning and functional properties of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in homomeric and heteromeric configuration. We have isolated a new member of the GENENOTIN family from a fetal brain cDNA library. This cDNA clone, designated GENEIN, shares a 90% CHEMICALIN identity with the previously reported GENEIN cDNA splice variant and differed from GENEIN in the CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN terminal regions. Cell lines stably expressing GENEIN protein formed homomeric GENENOTIN responsive, in order of decreasing affinity to domoate, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked currents showed partial desensitization that was reduced on incubation with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) but not CHEMICALNOTIN and were attenuated by the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Coexpression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN cDNAs in HEK 293 cells formed a heteromeric channel with unique properties. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN activated the heteromeric channel with significantly higher affinities than observed for GENEIN alone. Ligand binding studies with the recombinant GENEIN receptor expressed in mammalian cells indicated a high affinity CHEMICALIN binding site (Kd = 120 +/- 15.0 nM). The relative potency of compounds in displacing CHEMICALIN binding to GENEIN receptor was: domoate > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN = CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) = CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN.
8606397	CHEMICALNOTIN in the pathogenesis of pulmonary blast injury. Our previous studies demonstrate a significant increase of sulfidopeptide CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations in animals exposed to a free air blast. The aim of this study was to analyze the role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the local response of lung tissue as well as in the general response of organisms to blast overpressure. The study was conducted on adult rabbits exposed to moderate blast overpressure (four pulmonary contusions characterized as confluent ecchymoses involving 30 to 60% of the lungs), generated in laboratory conditions. One group of experimental animals was treated with GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri) (50 mg/kg, i.v.), immediately before blast. The early posttraumatic period was observed (30 minutes after blast). Hemodynamic parameters (mean arterial pressure, heart rate, blood gases) as well as arterial plasma levels of conjugated dienes were observed. The GENENOTIN activity, lipid peroxidation products levels, and water contents were measured in the lung tissue of injured rabbits. We observed that GENENOTIN inhibition reduced edema formation, accumulation of neutrophils, and generation of lipid peroxidation products in injured lungs. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits the increased systemic generation of conjugated dienes after blast injury. Although CHEMICALIN exerts local antioxidant activity with beneficial effects on lung tissue, this GENEIN inhibitor intensifies the blast overpressure caused hemodynamic insufficiency.
8647141	CHEMICALIN, the first prostate-selective GENEIN antagonist. A meta-analysis of two randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre studies in patients with benign prostatic obstruction (symptomatic BPH). European CHEMICALNOTIN Study Group. OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis of two European studies evaluated the efficacy and safety of modified-release CHEMICALNOTIN 0.4 mg once daily compared with placebo in patients with benign prostatic enlargement, lower urinary tract symptoms and prostatic obstruction (symptomatic BPH). METHODS: Patients entered a 2-week placebo run-in period, followed by randomization to treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN (382 patients) or placebo (193 patients) once daily for 12 weeks. RESULTS: Maximum urinary flow rate improved to a greater extent in the CHEMICALNOTIN group (1.6 ml/s, 16%) than the placebo group (0.6 ml/s, 6%) (p = 0.002). Total Boyarsky symptom score also improved to a greater extent in the CHEMICALNOTIN group (3.3 points, 35.1% reduction) than the placebo group (2.4 points, 25.5% reduction) (p = 0.002). Significantly more CHEMICALNOTIN patients (66%) than placebo patients (49%) had a > or = 25% decrease in total symptom score at endpoint (p < 0.001). Twelve weeks of treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN also produced significant improvements in average urinary flow rate (p = 0.005) and voiding or "obstructive" (p = 0.008) and storage or "irritative' (p = 0.017) symptom scores. The incidence of drug-related adverse events was comparable for the CHEMICALNOTIN and placebo groups (13 and 12% respectively, p = 0.802). The same applies to the incidence of adverse events commonly attributed to GENENOTIN antagonists, such as dizziness, headache, postural hypotension, syncope, asthenia, somnolence and rhinitis. There were no clinically significant changes in blood pressure or pulse rate in CHEMICALNOTIN patients compared with placebo patients both in hypertensive and normotensive BPH patients. CONCLUSION: CHEMICALNOTIN 0.4 mg once daily is safe, well-tolerated and improves both the symptoms and urinary flow rate in patients with benign prostatic obstruction (symptomatic BPH).
8666140	GENENOTIN gene: exon-intron organization and molecular scanning for mutations in Japanese subjects with NIDDM. GENENOTIN is converted to GENENOTIN by the concerted action of two sequence-specific GENENOTIN termed GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). GENENOTIN is a GENENOTIN that initiates the sequential processing of GENEIN to GENENOTIN by cleaving the GENEIN molecule on the CHEMICALIN-terminal side of the dibasic peptide, Arg31-Arg32, joining the B-chain and CHEMICALIN-peptide. Thus, GENENOTIN plays a key role in regulating GENENOTIN biosynthesis. Expressions of GENEIN and GENEIN, but not GENEIN, are coordinately regulated by CHEMICALIN, consistent with the important role of GENENOTIN in regulating GENENOTIN processing. NIDDM is associated with increased secretion of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN-like molecules, suggesting that mutations in the GENENOTIN gene may be involved in the development of this disorder. To examine this hypothesis, we have isolated and characterized the GENENOTIN gene and screened it for mutations in a group of Japanese subjects with NIDDM. The GENENOTIN gene consists of 14 exons spanning more than 35 kb. The exon-intron organization of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes are conserved, consistent with a common evolutionary origin for the GENENOTIN gene family. Single-strand conformational analysis and CHEMICALIN sequencing of the entire coding region of the GENEIN gene in 102 Japanese subjects with NIDDM revealed missense mutations in exons 2 (GENEIN) and 14 (GENEIN), neither of which was associated with NIDDM in this population. These data suggest that genetic variation in the GENENOTIN gene is unlikely to be a major contributor to NIDDM susceptibility in Japanese.
8730743	CHEMICALIN administration in the olfactory bulbectomized rat: changes in brain GENEIN and GENEIN binding sites and their relationship to behaviour. 1. The effects of repeated administration of the CHEMICALNOTIN antidepressant drug, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), on behaviour (locomotor activity and rearing) and the number and affinity of brain GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptor binding sites were examined in olfactory bulbectomized (OB) and sham-operated control rats. 2. Locomotor activity and rearing were increased in OB rats compared to sham-operated controls. The effect of various doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (administered orally twice daily for 21 days) on these behavioural measures was examined. A dose of 7.5 mg kg-1 provided optimal reversal of hyperlocomotion and increased rearing in OB rats, without changing these measures in sham-operated controls. 3. The time course of CHEMICALNOTIN (7.5 mg kg-1) on behavioural and neurochemical measures was examined. locomotion and rearing in OB rats were not significantly altered after 7 days, were significantly attenuated after 14 days and were normalized after 21 days. 4. After 7 days of CHEMICALIN administration the number of GENEIN was lower in frontal and occipital cortex and hippocampus. This reduction was largely restricted to the GENENOTIN subtype. Administration of CHEMICALIN for 14 or 21 days did not further reduce the number of GENEIN. The CHEMICALIN induced reduction in GENEIN did not differ in OB and sham-operated control rats. 5. CHEMICALIN administration for up to 21 days produced a progressive reduction in the number of GENEIN receptors in frontal cortex, without significant alterations in occipital cortex. 6. The time course of the reduction in the number of GENEIN receptors was similar to that of the CHEMICALIN-induced behavioural changes whereas that for the reduction in GENEIN was clearly different. 7. The present results suggest that the action of CHEMICALIN in this animal model is unlikely to be directly related to a reduction in GENEIN but may be related to a reduction in frontal cortical GENEIN receptors.
8755512	Binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN may be involved in its inhibition of GENEIN production. In addition to its well known sedative and teratogenic effects, thalidomide also possesses potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities, being most effective against leprosy and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The immunomodulatory activity of CHEMICALIN has been ascribed to the selective inhibition of GENEIN from monocytes. The molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN remains unknown. To elucidate this mechanism, we synthesized an active photoaffinity label of CHEMICALNOTIN as a probe to identify the molecular target of the drug. Using the probe, we specifically labeled a pair of proteins of 43-45 kDa with high acidity from bovine thymus extract. Purification of these proteins and partial peptide sequence determination revealed them to be GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). We show that the binding of CHEMICALIN photoaffinity label to authentic GENEIN is competed with both CHEMICALIN and the nonradioactive photoaffinity label at concentrations comparable to those required for inhibition of production of GENEIN from human monocytes, suggesting that GENEIN may be involved in the immunomodulatory activity of CHEMICALIN.
8793745	GENEIN heterogeneity in rat hippocampal neurons revealed by differential sensitivity to CHEMICALIN. 1. The kinetics of onset of CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN desensitization by CHEMICALIN, and the extent of attenuation of GENEIN desensitization by CHEMICALIN, showed pronounced cell-to-cell variation in cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. Cultures prepared from area CA1 stratum radiatum tended to show weaker modulation by CHEMICALNOTIN than cultures prepared from the whole hippocampus. 2. Kinetic analysis of concentration jump responses to CHEMICALNOTIN revealed multiple populations of receptors with fast (approximately 400 ms), intermediate (approximately 2-4 s), and slow (> 20 s) time constants for recovery from modulation by CHEMICALNOTIN. The amplitudes of these components varied widely between cells, suggesting the existence of at least three populations of GENENOTIN subtypes, the relative density of which varied from cell to cell. 3. The complex patterns of sensitivity to CHEMICALIN seen in hippocampal neurons could be reconstituted by assembly of recombinant GENEIN subunits generated from cDNAs encoding the flip (i) and flop (o) splice variants of the GENEIN and GENEIN subunits. Recovery from modulation by CHEMICALIN was slower for GENEIN and GENEIN than for GENEIN and GENEIN. 4. Coexpression of the flip and flop splice variants of GENEIN, in the absence of GENENOTIN, revealed that heteromeric GENEIN with intermediate sensitivity to CHEMICALIN, similar to responses observed for the combinations GENEIN or GENEIN, could be generated independently of the presence of the GENEIN subunit. However, recovery from modulation by CHEMICALIN was twofold slower for GENEIN than for homomeric GENEIN, indicating that the GENEIN and GENEIN subunits are not functionally equivalent in controlling sensitivity to CHEMICALIN. 5. These results demonstrate that GENENOTIN expressed in hippocampal neurons are assembled in a variety of subunit and splice variant combinations that might serve as a mechanism to fine-tune the kinetics of synaptic transmission.
8797532	Striatal CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN in chronic CHEMICALNOTIN users. Depletion of striatal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been hypothesized to explain some of the neurological and psychiatric complications of chronic use of CHEMICALNOTIN, including increased risk for neuroleptic-precipitated movement disorders. We measured levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, as well as two CHEMICALNOTIN nerve terminal indices, namely, the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in autopsied brain of 12 chronic CHEMICALNOTIN users. Mean CHEMICALNOTIN levels were normal in the putamen, the motor component of the striatum; however 4 of the 12 subjects had CHEMICALNOTIN values below the lower limit of the control range. CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations were significantly reduced in the caudate head (head, -33%; tail, -39%) with a trend for reduction in nucleus accumbens (-27%). Striatal GENENOTIN protein (-25 to -46%) and GENENOTIN (-17 to -22%) were reduced, whereas GENEIN determined by CHEMICALIN binding was normal. In conclusion, our data suggest that chronic CHEMICALIN use is associated with modestly reduced levels of striatal CHEMICALNOTIN and the GENEIN in some subjects and that these changes might contribute to the neurological and psychiatric effects of the drug.
8827452	Purification and characterization of a novel GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) from human plasma: it has three EGF, a kringle and a GENENOTIN, similar to hepatocyte growth factor activator. A novel GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was purified from human plasma by affinity chromatography on hyaluronan-conjugated Sepharose. The contaminating GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in the partially purified preparation were removed with anti-GENENOTIN antibody-conjugated Sepharose and anti-GENENOTIN antibody-conjugated Sepharose, respectively, and no other contaminant was observed. Finally, 800 micrograms of GENENOTIN was isolated from 500 ml of human plasma. GENENOTIN gave a single 70-kDa band on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions, and 50-kDa and 17-kDa bands under reducing conditions. Thus, GENEIN was a heterodimer composed of 50-kDa and 17-kDa subunits, bridged by a CHEMICALIN linkage. Both subunits had novel CHEMICALNOTIN sequences, indicating that GENENOTIN was a novel hyaluronan-binding protein in human plasma. The CHEMICALIN sequence deduced from the CHEMICALIN sequence of the cloned GENEIN cDNA exhibited significant homology to that of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The results of Northern blot analysis indicated that liver, kidney, and pancreas expressed GENENOTIN mRNA. The predicted structure of GENEIN showed three GENEIN, a GENEIN and a GENEIN, from its CHEMICALIN-terminus, although GENEIN has a GENEIN, an GENEIN, a GENEIN, an GENEIN, a GENEIN, and a GENEIN, from its CHEMICALIN-terminus.
8863950	Hypoxemia associated with CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in a newborn infant. CHEMICALNOTIN therapy used for the treatment of gastric bleeding due to CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in a newborn infant was temporally associated with episodes of severe hypoxemia. It appears likely that the GENEIN blocked by CHEMICALIN obviated the pulmonary vasodilator effect of CHEMICALIN therapy.
8882618	Interactions of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN at GENEIN: patch clamp recordings in cultured neurones and area CA1 in hippocampal slices. 1. The CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN antagonized CHEMICALNOTIN-induced currents in cultured superior colliculus neurones in a non use-dependent manner (steady state IC50s: CHEMICALNOTIN 9.8 +/- 0.6 microM; CHEMICALNOTIN 3.1 +/- 0.6 microM; CHEMICALNOTIN 0.8 +/- 0.1 microM). 2. Higher concentrations of all three antagonists slowed the onset kinetics and quickened the offset kinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced currents indicative of an allosteric interaction with the CHEMICALNOTIN recognition site. 3. CHEMICALNOTIN (3-300 microM) dramatically slowed desensitization of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced currents and potentiated steady state currents (EC50 10.0 +/- 2.5 microM) to a much greater degree than peak currents. Both tau on and tau off were also increased by CHEMICALNOTIN in a concentration-dependent manner (EC50: tau on 42.1 +/- 4.5 microM; tau off 31.6 +/- 6.6 microM). 4. CHEMICALNOTIN (10-100 microM) shifted the concentration-response curves of the CHEMICALNOTIN to the right. For example, with 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN the IC50s of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on steady-state CHEMICALNOTIN-induced currents were 57.9 +/- 9.5 and 41.6 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively. 5. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN concentration-dependently reversed the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microM) on offset kinetics (CHEMICALNOTIN IC50 16.6 +/- 4.2 microM). However, the CHEMICALNOTIN were unable to reintroduce desensitization in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and even concentration-dependently slowed the onset kinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN responses further (CHEMICALNOTIN EC50 8.0 +/- 2.8 microM). 6. CHEMICALIN decreased the peak amplitude of hippocampal area CA1 GENEIN-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (e.p.s.cs) (IC50 10.8 +/- 0.8 microM) with no apparent effect on response kinetics. CHEMICALIN prolonged the decay time constant of GENEIN-mediated e.p.s.cs (EC50 35.7 +/- 6.5 microM) with less pronounced effects in slowing e.p.s.c. onset kinetics and increasing e.p.s.c. amplitude. 7. CHEMICALIN (330 microM) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-mediated e.p.s.c. peak amplitude to the right (CHEMICALNOTIN IC50 26.9 +/- 9.4 microM). Likewise, CHEMICALIN (30-100 microM)) shifted the concentration-response curve for the effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-mediated e.p.s.c. decay time constants to the right. 8. In conclusion, CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN seem to bind to different sites on GENEIN but exert strong allosteric interactions with one another and with other domains such as the agonist recognition site. The interactions of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-mediated e.p.s.cs in area CA1 of hippocampal slices provide evidence that the decay time constant of these synaptic events are not governed by desensitization.
8930173	Comparison of ligand binding affinities at GENENOTIN and the high affinity state of GENENOTIN subtypes. To identify selective compounds for nonadrenergic GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the affinities of 22 ligands for CHEMICALIN binding have been compared at GENEIN (analyzed under CHEMICALNOTIN mask of GENENOTIN) and at GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN stably expressed on transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. Competition curves at the platelet GENENOTIN were biphasic for most compounds. Only CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN displayed monophasic I1 competition curves. CHEMICALNOTIN, an endogenous neurotransmitter candidate for the GENENOTIN, was identified as the most selective agent for a subcomponent of platelet GENENOTIN. The affinity of CHEMICALNOTIN at the high affinity component of platelet GENENOTIN was 1400-fold selective over GENENOTIN, 5000-fold selective over GENENOTIN and 800-fold selective over GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN also displayed selectivities for a high affinity component of the platelet GENENOTIN over GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN was the most selective compound for the high affinity state of the GENEIN, displaying 7-, 23- and 9-fold higher affinity than GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and platelet GENENOTIN, respectively. No single selective compound was identified for the GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN displayed, respectively, 18- and 31-fold selectivity for the high affinity state of the GENENOTIN as compared to GENENOTIN- or GENENOTIN, and was > 100,000- fold selective over platelet GENENOTIN. Thus, GENENOTIN and the platelet GENENOTIN can be clearly discriminated based on their affinities for certain compounds.
9008235	Activation of cytoprotective GENEIN by CHEMICALIN as a possible explanation for its hair growth-stimulating effect. Data from the literature indicate that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN, induce hair loss in vivo. These NSAIDs are well-known inhibitors of both the cytoprotective isoform of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and of the inducible form (GENENOTIN). By immunohistochemical staining, we found that GENENOTIN is the main isoform present in the dermal papilla from normal human hair follicle (either anagen or catagen), whereas GENENOTIN was only faintly and exclusively expressed in anagen dermal papilla. Thus, GENENOTIN might be the primary target of the hair growth-inhibitory effects of NSAIDs. We thus speculated that activation of GENEIN might be a mechanism by which CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) stimulates hair growth in vivo. We demonstrate here that CHEMICALIN is a potent activator of purified GENEIN (AC50 = 80 microM), as assayed by CHEMICALNOTIN consumption and PGE2 production. This activation was also evidenced by increased PGE2 production by BALB/c 3T3 fibroblasts and by human dermal papilla fibroblasts in culture. Our findings suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN and its derivatives may have a cytoprotective activity in vivo and that more potent second-generation hair growth-promoting drugs might be designed, based on this mechanism.
9020367	Clonal CD8+ and CD52- T cells are induced in responding B cell lymphoma patients treated with Campath-1H (anti-CD52). Five patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and 4 patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) were treated with the CDR-grafted (rat x human) monoclonal antibody (mAb) Campath-1H (anti-CD52). Tumour regression was noted preferentially in peripheral blood and in the bone marrow but lymph nodes were less affected. Normal blood B and T cells were profoundly reduced in all patients whereas CD16+ NK cells and CD14+ monocytes decreased marginally. In all responding CLL patients CD52-negative T but not B cells appeared during treatment and persisted for several months (4-19+) during unmaintained follow-up. Clonal T cells defined as a predominance of a single T cell receptor (TCR) V gene usage, in one case verified by TCR CDR3 fragment analysis and nucleotide sequencing, emerged within the CD52-/CD8+ cell population during Campath-1H therapy in 2 CLL patients, both achieving a long-lasting remission. The increase in CD8+ T cell expansions (up to 23-fold) during unmaintained remission and follow-up suggest that the clonal CD8+ cells may represent regulatory T cells controlling the growth of the tumour B cell clone. Clonal T cells might thus be a target for an immune therapeutic intervention in B cell tumours.
9039330	Clinical manifestations of genetic defects affecting gonadotrophins and their receptors. Raised activity of the LH axis caused by activating mutations of LH receptor gene presents with precocious puberty in boys, analogous to the presentation of LH secreting pituitary adenomas (Faggiano et al., 1983; Ambrosi et al., 1990). LH "hyperactivity' in females appears to have no effect. Hyperactivity of the FSH axis caused by activating mutations of the FSH receptor gene might parallel the presentation of FSH secreting pituitary adenomas with Sertoli cell hypertrophy in men (Heseltine et al., 1989) or reversible premature ovarian failure in women (Moses et al., 1986; Okuda et al., 1989). Indeed the first such case to be described is a male who maintained testicular volume and fertility in the absence of gonadotrophins (Gromoll et al., 1996). Female precocious puberty may require hyperactivity of both gonadotrophin axes because of the "two-cell' arrangement required for ovarian oestrogen production. Mutations of the Gs alpha-subunit gene can mimic this situation in some women with the McCune-Albright syndrome (Malchoff et al., 1994). Lack of LH activity caused by defects in the LH beta molecule causes infertility in men and that resulting from inactivating mutations of the LH receptor gene causes Leydig cell agenesis in men while ovarian development in females is relatively normal. Lack of FSH activity caused by defects in the FSH beta caused infertility in a female, and that caused by inactivating mutations of the FSH receptor gene causes ovarian dysgenesis in women but only variable depression of spermatogenesis in men. Incidentally, this categorization of reproductive disorders may also be applied to the TSH axis. Pituitary adenomas and activating mutations of the TSH receptor gene (Parma et al., 1993) cause hyperthyroidism and TSH beta gene defects (Hayashizaki et al., 1989) and inactivating mutations of the TSH receptor gene (Sunthornthepvarakul et al., 1995) cause hypothyroidism. To complete the analogy with thyroid disorders, it is curious that despite structural similarities with the TSH receptor, neither LH nor FSH receptor autoantibodies have a prominent role in ovarian pathophysiology (Moncayo et al., 1989; Van Weissenbruch et al., 1991; Simoni et al., 1993). Complete gonadotrophin resistance is likely to be very rare, however, so what are we likely to find in partial gonadotrophin resistance? Might the "resistant ovary syndrome' come right in the end, with corresponding minor FSH receptor mutations? Experience with insulin and androgen resistance syndromes suggests that such a scenario is unlikely. Insulin receptor gene mutations are found in extreme Type A insulin resistance but not in moderate forms of insulin resistance (O'Rahilly et al., 1991). Androgen receptor gene mutations are found in nearly all cases of complete androgen insensitivity but rarely in partial forms (Patterson et al., 1994). Mild resistance to hormone action is rarely detectable in relatives who are heterozygous for receptor mutations which are inherited in a recessive pattern. It seems unlikely therefore, that individuals heterozygous for inactivating receptor mutations will manifest symptoms of reproductive disorders and account for common conditions. Thus, while mutation analysis provides new insights into the gender specific role of the gonadotrophins the cause of early gonadal failure in the majority of individuals remains a mystery.
9063462	Evolution of the GENENOTIN family and the organization of the Drosophila GENENOTIN gene. Intron/exon structure of the gene, control of expression of the two mRNAs, selective advantage of the multienzyme complex. In Drosophila, GENEIN is a multifunctional synthetase encoded by a unique gene and composed of three domains: the CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-terminal domains catalyze the aminoacylation of CHEMICALIN and proline tRNA species, respectively, and the central domain is made of 75 CHEMICALIN repeated six times amongst which 46 are highly conserved and constitute the repeated motifs [Cerini, C., Kerjan, P., Astier, M., Gratecos, D., Mirande, M. & Semeriva, M. (1991) EMBO J. 10, 4267-4277]. The intron/exon organization of the Drosophila gene reveals the presence of six exons among which four are in the 5'-end encoding CHEMICALNOTIN activity. Only one exon encodes the repeated motifs. A comparison of introns positions, intron classes and intron/exon boundaries in the Drosophila gene and in its human counterpart is compatible with the intron-early hypothesis presiding, at least in part, to the evolution of the GENENOTIN. The full-length fly protein is encoded by a 6.1-kb mRNA which is expressed throughout development. In addition, a shorter transcript encompasses the 3'-end of the cDNA and it is especially abundant in 5-10-h embryos until the first larval stage. Expression of these two mRNAs seems to be controlled by two independent promoters. The 6.1-kb mRNA promoter is probably localized in the 5'-end of the gene. The small mRNA promoter resides in the 4th intron and evidence is provided that the mRNA encodes only the domain corresponding to GENENOTIN and is functional in vivo. Finally, transgenic flies have been established by using constructs corresponding to the three domains of the protein. Overexpression of the repeated motifs leads to a sterility of the flies that suggests a role of these motifs in linking the multienzyme complex to an, as yet, unknown structure of the protein synthesis apparatus.
9204085	Pharmacology and chemistry of CHEMICALNOTIN. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALNOTIN research in the field of dermatology has been influenced by the clinical success of topical CHEMICALNOTIN and oral CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of acne, and by the discovery of high-affinity binding proteins for CHEMICALNOTIN mediating its action and interaction with other CHEMICALNOTIN and hormones. OBJECTIVE: We sought molecules with an optimal balance between stability, efficacy, and local tolerance for topical acne therapy. METHODS: In vitro and in vivo bioassay systems were used to test the ability of CHEMICALNOTIN to modulate cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition, antiinflammatory properties were assessed. Binding and transactivation assays were used to compare affinities and transcriptional activities of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for the GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN). RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: CHEMICALNOTIN is a stable CHEMICALNOTIN derivative with potent CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacology, controlling cell proliferation and differentiation. In addition it has significant antiinflammatory action. The GENEIN GENEIN and GENEIN mediate the CHEMICALNOTIN activity of CHEMICALIN.
9211565	CHEMICALNOTIN protects against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced gastric mucosal injury in rats: role of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN compounds. This study was designed to determine the gastroprotective properties of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a novel prokinetic CHEMICALIN derivative agonist of GENEIN and GENEIN receptors and GENEIN antagonist, on mucosal injury produced by 50% (v/v) CHEMICALNOTIN. Results were compared with those for CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN: 10 mg kg-1). The possible involvements of gastric mucus secretion, endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN compounds (CHEMICALNOTIN) in the protection mediated by CHEMICALNOTIN were also examined. Intraperitoneal administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.50 and 1 mg kg-1), 30 min before CHEMICALNOTIN, significantly prevented gastric ulceration and increased the CHEMICALNOTIN content of gastric mucus. CHEMICALNOTIN (1 mg kg-1) also produced a significant increase in gastric mucosal levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, but did not induce any significant changes in CHEMICALNOTIN values. On the contrary, pretreatment with CHEMICALIN worsened CHEMICALIN-induced erosions, however, did not affect gastric mucus secretion, GENEIN content or CHEMICALNOTIN levels, although the non-protein CHEMICALNOTIN fraction was significantly decreased. The present results demonstrate that the gastroprotective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN could be partly explained by a complex CHEMICALNOTIN dependent mechanism. We suggest that CHEMICALIN dependent mechanisms through GENEIN receptor blockade and GENEIN receptor activation could be also involved.
9231703	Cloning, characterization, and expression of a calcitonin receptor from guinea pig brain. A calcitonin receptor was cloned from guinea pig brain by using a degenerate reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) strategy. When the cloned guinea pig calcitonin receptor was transfected into COS 1 cells, salmon calcitonin stimulated intracellular cyclic AMP accumulation with an EC50 of 0.1 nM, whereas human calcitonin was >250-fold less potent (EC50 27.6 nM). Related neuropeptides rat alphaCGRP and rat amylin did not activate the guinea pig calcitonin receptor at physiologic concentrations. Stimulation of the transfected guinea pig calcitonin receptor by salmon calcitonin also resulted in phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis with an EC50 of 2.5 nM. Expression of the calcitonin receptor was mapped by a combination of RT-PCR, northern analysis, and expression in Xenopus oocytes. The guinea pig calcitonin receptor was most highly expressed in diencephalon and a single subtype was detected.
9299436	GENENOTIN is a specific partner for the GENENOTIN isoform GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is an isoform of GENENOTIN, thought to arise by alternative splicing, that lacks a functional GENENOTIN but retains functional GENENOTIN, which allow interaction with other proteins through binding to prolinerich sequences. Several evidences suggest that besides common partners for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, specific targets could exist. In order to find specific partners for GENENOTIN, we have screened a human cDNA library by the yeast two-hybrid system with GENENOTIN as a bait. We have identified GENEIN, an enzyme involved in CHEMICALIN metabolism whose deficiency is associated with severe combined immunodeficiency, as a GENENOTIN binding protein that is not able to bind to GENENOTIN. This interaction has been confirmed in vitro with GENENOTIN fusion proteins and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in NIH3T3 cells stably transfected with GENENOTIN. The functional significance of this finding is discussed.
9310349	CHEMICALIN inhibition of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a potent CHEMICALNOTIN that inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption and has proven effective for the treatment of osteoporosis. Its molecular mechanism of action, however, has not been defined precisely. Here we report that CHEMICALIN is a potent inhibitor of the GENEIN (GENEIN). Two substrates were employed in this study: fluorescein CHEMICALNOTIN and the phosphotyrosyl peptide GENENOTIN-pY527. With either substrate, CHEMICALIN was a slow binding inhibitor of GENEIN. Among the other CHEMICALIN studied, CHEMICALIN was more potent and selective for GENEIN. The hydrolysis of fluorescein CHEMICALIN by GENEIN and GENEIN was sensitive to CHEMICALIN, with IC50 values of less than 1 microM; GENEIN, however, under the same conditions, was inhibited by only 50% with 141 microM CHEMICALIN. Similarly, with the GENENOTIN-pY527 substrate, CHEMICALIN inhibition was also GENEIN dependent. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN with an IC50 value of 23 microM, GENEIN with an IC50 value of 2 microM, and did not inhibit GENEIN at concentrations up to 1 mM. The CHEMICALIN inhibition of these three GENEIN and two substrates is consistent with the formation of a ternary complex comprised of enzyme, substrate, and inhibitor. GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN was diminished by the metal chelating agent CHEMICALIN, or by the reducing agent CHEMICALIN, suggesting that a metal ion and the oxidation of a CHEMICALIN residue are required for full inhibition. These observations show substrate- and enzyme-specific GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN and support the possibility that a certain GENEIN(s) may be the molecular target for CHEMICALIN action.
9313928	Ligand binding specificities of the eight types and subtypes of the GENENOTIN expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. 1. Eight types and subtypes of the GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subtypes of the GENENOTIN, were stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Their ligand binding characteristics were examined with thirty two CHEMICALNOTIN and their analogues by determining the Ki values from the displacement curves of radioligand binding to the respective receptors. 2. The GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN showed high ligand binding specificity and only bound their own putative ligands with high affinity such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for GENEIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for GENEIN, and CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for GENEIN. 3. The GENEIN bound CHEMICALIN alpha and CHEMICALIN with Ki values of 3-4 nM. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN bound to this receptor with Ki values less than 100 nM. 4. The GENEIN receptor bound CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN in addition to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, with Ki values of 14-36 nM. CHEMICALIN and two putative GENEIN antagonists, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, did not show any significant binding to this receptor. CHEMICALIN, a putative GENEIN agonist, and CHEMICALIN, a putative GENEIN/GENEIN agonist, also bound to this receptor with Ki values of 120 nM. 5. The GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors showed similar binding profiles. They bound CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in addition to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The two receptors were discriminated by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN that bound to the GENEIN receptor but not to the GENEIN receptor, and by CHEMICALIN that bound to the GENEIN but not to the GENEIN receptor. 6. The GENEIN receptor showed the broadest binding profile, and bound CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, in addition to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, with Ki values of 0.6-3.7 nM. In addition, three GENEIN ligands, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, and one GENEIN ligand, CHEMICALIN, bound to this receptor with Ki values comparable to the Ki values of these compounds for the CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively. CHEMICALIN alpha showed only weak binding to the GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN receptor at 10 microM concentration.
9336833	The structures of GENENOTIN from herpes simplex virus type 1 in complex with substrates and a substrate analogue. GENEIN from Herpes simplex virus type 1 (GENEIN) was crystallized in an CHEMICALIN-terminally truncated but fully active form. The structures of GENEIN complexed with CHEMICALIN at the CHEMICALNOTIN-site and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) at the substrate-site were refined to 2.75 A, 2.8 A, and 3.0 A resolution, respectively. CHEMICALNOTIN catalyzes the phosphorylation of CHEMICALNOTIN resulting in an CHEMICALNOTIN, and the phosphorylation of CHEMICALNOTIN giving rise to an CHEMICALNOTIN. The presented CHEMICALNOTIN structures indicate that there are only small differences between these two modes of action. Glu83 serves as a general base in the CHEMICALNOTIN reaction. Arg163 parks at an internal CHEMICALNOTIN during CHEMICALNOTIN formation and binds the CHEMICALNOTIN of CHEMICALNOTIN during CHEMICALNOTIN formation. The bound CHEMICALNOTIN leaves a 35 A3 cavity at position 5 of the base and two sequestered water molecules at position 2. Cavity and water molecules reduce the substrate specificity to such an extent that CHEMICALNOTIN can CHEMICALNOTIN various substrate analogues useful in pharmaceutical applications. GENENOTIN is structurally homologous to the well-known GENENOTIN but contains large additional peptide segments.
9374794	Blockage of the GENEIN by the gastrointestinal prokinetic agent CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, a gastrointestinal prokinetic agent, is known to cause long Q-T syndrome and ventricular arrhythmias. The cellular mechanism is not known. The GENEIN (GENEIN), which encodes the rapidly activating delayed rectifier CHEMICALNOTIN current and is important in cardiac repolarization, may serve as a target for the action of CHEMICALIN. We tested the hypothesis that CHEMICALIN blocks GENEIN. The whole cell patch-clamp recording technique was used to study GENENOTIN channels stably expressed heterologously in HEK293 cells. Under voltage-clamp conditions, CHEMICALIN block of GENEIN is dose dependent with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 6.5 nM at 22 degrees C (n = 25 cells). Currents rapidly recovered with drug washout. The onset of block by CHEMICALNOTIN required channel activation indicative of open or inactivated state blockage. Block of GENEIN with CHEMICALIN after channel activation was voltage dependent. At -20 mV, 10 nM CHEMICALIN reduced GENEIN tail-current amplitude by 5%, whereas, at + 20 mV, the tail-current amplitude was reduced by 45% (n = 4 cells). At -20 and + 20 mV, 100 nM CHEMICALNOTIN reduced tail-current amplitude by 66 and 90%, respectively. We conclude that CHEMICALIN is a potent blocker of GENEIN channels expressed in HEK293 cells. This effect may account for the clinical occurrence of Q-T prolongation and ventricular arrhythmias observed with CHEMICALNOTIN.
9417820	Analysis of GENENOTIN in the human spinal cord. GENEIN in postmortem human spinal cord were analyzed using CHEMICALIN ligand binding and immunoblotting with GENENOTIN subunit-specific antibodies. The average KD for CHEMICALNOTIN binding was 1.77 nM with a Bmax of 0.103 pmol/mg. The EC50 for stimulation of -CHEMICALNOTIN binding with CHEMICALNOTIN was 0.34 microM. None of these parameters were affected by postmortem intervals up to 72 h. Immunoblotting of native GENENOTIN showed that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN subunits could all be found in the human spinal cord of which GENENOTIN was preferentially located to the dorsal half. Immunoprecipitation of solubilized receptors revealed that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN subunits coprecipitated with the GENENOTIN subunit, indicating that native human spinal cord GENENOTIN are GENENOTIN assembled by at least three different receptor subunits. These results provide a basis for the development of drugs selectively aimed at spinal cord GENENOTIN for the future treatment of spinal cord disorders.
9476974	GENEIN and GENEIN mechanisms in the rapid pressor response to CHEMICALIN. Intravenous (I.V.) CHEMICALNOTIN (0.03-3 mg/kg) produced dose-dependent, rapid, and brief increases in blood pressure (BP) in conscious rats pretreated with the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN uptake inhibitors structurally analogous to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN) also produced this rapid pressor response, whereas structurally unrelated uptake inhibitors with diverse GENEIN selectivities (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) either did not produce a rapid pressor response or produced only a small pressor response. At nonconvulsant doses, the GENEIN blockers CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN produced a small pressor response or no increase in BP. In rats implanted with telemetric devices, CHEMICALNOTIN and its analog, CHEMICALNOTIN, produced a biphasic pharmacological response that consisted of an initial brief and abrupt behavioral arousal associated with a rapid, large increase in BP followed by prolonged, parallel increases in BP and locomotor activity. Pretreatment with CHEMICALNOTIN prevented the prolonged but not the initial rapid and brief pressor and activity responses to both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN administration. The present data suggest that the inhibition of GENENOTIN functions, either alone or in combination, does not mediate the rapid pressor response to CHEMICALNOTIN. The GENEIN-blocking action of CHEMICALIN per se does not appear to be involved in the rapid pressor response to CHEMICALNOTIN. Finally, the present results confirm previous findings that dopaminergic mechanisms mediate the prolonged increases in BP and locomotor activity produced by CHEMICALNOTIN.
9480897	Identification of cDNAs encoding two human alpha class glutathione transferases (GSTA3 and GSTA4) and the heterologous expression of GSTA4-4. The Expressed Sequence Tag database has been searched for examples of previously undescribed human Alpha class glutathione transferases. An incomplete transcript of the previously described GSTA3 gene was identified in a cDNA library derived from 8-9 week placenta. This indicates that the GSTA3 gene is functional and is possibly under specific developmental regulation. A second cDNA, termed GSTA4, was identified in a brain cDNA library. The encoded GSTA4-4 enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli and was found to be immunologically distinct from GSTA1-1 and to have high activity with alk-2-enals. Although GSTA4-4 appears to be functionally similar to the mouse GST5.7 and rat GST8-8 Alpha class enzymes, sequence comparisons and phylogenetic analysis suggest that GSTA4-4 may be a member of a distinct Alpha class subgroup.
9551716	Characterization of binding sites of a new GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, in the rat brain. The present study describes the characterization of the binding properties and autoradiographic distribution of a new nonpeptide antagonist of GENEIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), in the rat brain. The binding of CHEMICALNOTIN in brain membrane homogenates was specific, time-dependent, reversible and saturable. CHEMICALNOTIN bound to an apparently homogeneous population of sites, with a Kd of 3.5 nM and a Bmax value of 508 fmol/mg of protein, which was 80% higher than that observed in saturation experiments with CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN binding was inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN, the related nonpeptide receptor antagonist, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN. Saturation and competition studies in the presence or absence of the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, revealed that CHEMICALIN bound with similar affinities to both the CHEMICALIN-insensitive GENEIN (20% of the total binding population) and the recently cloned CHEMICALIN-sensitive GENEIN (80% of the receptors) (Kd = 6.8 and 4.8 nM, respectively). The regional distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN binding in the rat brain closely matched the distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN binding. In conclusion, these findings indicate that CHEMICALIN is a new potent antagonist radioligand which recognizes with high affinity both GENEIN and GENEIN and represents thus an excellent tool to study GENEIN in the rat brain.
9557255	A new concept of drug delivery for acne. CHEMICALNOTIN is a stable CHEMICALNOTIN derivative that displays a strong CHEMICALNOTIN agonist pharmacology. This drug controls cell proliferation and differentiation, and possesses significant anti-inflammatory action. The CHEMICALIN action of CHEMICALIN are mediated by the GENEIN GENENOTIN GENEIN and GENEIN. We describe here how an aqueous gel containing CHEMICALNOTIN was selected for the topical treatment of acne.
9584217	Isoform-specific inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN is independent of isoform-specific gating properties. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) block GENEIN more potently at depolarized membrane potentials, consistent with high affinity binding to the inactivated state. CHEMICALIN (a CHEMICALIN antagonist) blocks the GENEIN more potently than the cardiac one, a phenomenon observed not only in native channels but also in expressed channels. We examined whether this tissue specificity was attributable to differences of inactivation in the two channel types. We expressed cardiac or GENEIN subunits in combination with beta2a and alpha2/delta subunits in human embryonic kidney cells, and used 2 mM CHEMICALIN as the permeant ion. This system thus reproduces the in vivo topology and charge carrier of the channels while facilitating comparison of the two alpha1C splice variants. Both voltage-dependent and isoform-specific sensitivity of 10 nM CHEMICALNOTIN inhibition of the channel were demonstrated, with the use of -100 mV as the holding potential for fully reprimed channels and -65 mV to populate the inactivated state. Under drug-free conditions, we characterized fast inactivation (1-sec prepulses) and slow inactivation (3 min prepulses) in the two isoforms. Inactivation parameters were not statistically different in the two channel isoforms; if anything, GENENOTIN tended to inactivate more than the GENENOTIN at relevant voltages. Likewise, the voltage-dependent activation was identical in the two isoforms. We thus conclude that the more potent CHEMICALIN inhibition of smooth muscle versus GENEIN is not attributable to differences in channel inactivation or activation. Intrinsic, gating-independent GENEIN binding affinity differences must be invoked to explain the isoform-specific sensitivity of the CHEMICALIN block.
9587031	Remethylation defects: guidelines for clinical diagnosis and treatment. The main remethylation defects include disorders which all have defective CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis in common. GENEIN deficiency impairs CHEMICALIN synthesis, defects in cytosolic reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN (CblC/D) impair the synthesis of both CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN and deficiencies of GENEIN (CblE/G) are associated with defective CHEMICALIN synthesis. The clinical presentation is characterized by acute neurological distress in early infancy. In childhood, patients present with progressive encephalopathy with an end-stage which has many signs in common with the adult onset form. In fact, both have more or less severe signs of subacute degeneration of the cord. CHEMICALNOTIN defective patients must be treated with parenteral supplementation of CHEMICALNOTIN (1-2 mg per dose). Some CHEMICALNOTIN patients could be CHEMICALNOTIN responsive and must have a high-dosage folate trial. In addition, oral CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation (2-9 g per day depending on age) appears an effective means to prevent further neurological deterioration.
9614060	Increased GENEIN-mediated cationic CHEMICALIN transport functionally compensates in GENENOTIN knockout cell lines. CHEMICALNOTIN transport is important for a number of biological processes in vertebrates, and its transport may be rate-limiting for the production of CHEMICALNOTIN. The majority of CHEMICALIN transport is mediated by GENEIN, although several other carriers have been kinetically defined. GENEIN cationic CHEMICALIN transport is mediated by proteins encoded by a family of genes, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. High affinity CHEMICALNOTIN transport was investigated in embryonic fibroblast cells derived from GENENOTIN knockout mice that lack functional GENENOTIN. Both wild type and knockout cells transport CHEMICALNOTIN with comparable Km and Vmax. However, the apparent affinity for CHEMICALIN transport was 2.4 times lower in GENENOTIN(-/-) cells when compared with wild type cells, a property characteristic of GENEIN-mediated transport. Northern analysis-documented GENENOTIN mRNA increased 2-fold, whereas GENENOTIN mRNA levels increased 11-fold in GENENOTIN(-/-) relative to GENENOTIN(+/+) cells. The low affinity GENENOTIN mRNA was not detectably expressed in these cells. Even though GENENOTIN expression is normally limited to adult brain, there was a large increase in the amount of GENENOTIN protein present at the plasma membrane of GENENOTIN(-/-) embryonic fibroblast cells. These results suggest that GENEIN compensates for the loss of functional GENENOTIN in cells derived from GENENOTIN knockout mice and mediates the majority of high affinity CHEMICALIN transport.
9712175	Effect of CHEMICALIN, a new GENEIN antagonist, on gastric emptying of a solid-liquid meal in humans. The role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in the regulation of gastric emptying of physiological meals containing solids and liquids in humans remains controversial. We studied the role of endogenous GENENOTIN in the emptying of a solid/liquid meal administering the new, highly specific and potent GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN. Gastric emptying was assessed in nine healthy male volunteers using a randomized, double blind, two-period crossover design with oral CHEMICALNOTIN (15 mg 1 h prior to meal intake) or placebo on two different days. After ingestion of a pancake (570 kcal) labelled with 500 microCi of CHEMICALNOTIN colloid and 500 ml 10% dextrose containing 80 microCi. CHEMICALNOTIN, subjects were studied in a sitting position, using a dual-headed gamma camera. Plasma GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were measured by a specific RIA. CHEMICALNOTIN distinctly accelerated gastric emptying of solids, while gastric emptying of liquids was not significantly altered. The lag period was shortened by 20% (P<0.05), AUC and half emptying time of solid emptying were lowered by 12% and 13%, respectively (P<0.03). CHEMICALIN markedly increased postprandial plasma GENEIN release (P<0.001) while distinctly reducing postprandial GENEIN levels (P<0.01) as compared to placebo. These data provide further evidence for a significant role of GENENOTIN in the regulation of gastric emptying of solids. The study demonstrates for the first time the marked gastrokinetic properties of the new GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN in humans.
9730867	GENENOTIN-mediated inhibition of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA accumulation in activated human T lymphocytes is solely mediated by the GENENOTIN subtype. GENENOTIN gene expression in T lymphocytes is a strictly regulated process, involving both stimulatory and inhibitory signals. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) agonists are widely used in the treatment of asthma and are able to induce an inhibitory signal on immunological responses after binding to their specific receptors. In this study, the characterization of GENENOTIN subtype(s) (beta1, beta2, and beta3) involved in the regulation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mRNA accumulation was studied by using various GENENOTIN agonists and antagonists. GENEIN (GENEIN)-induced GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN mRNAs are dose-dependently inhibited by the nonselective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN and by the selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN mRNA accumulation was not susceptible to GENENOTIN stimulation. The observed inhibition on GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN mRNA was blocked by the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (10(-6) M) and by CHEMICALIN (10(-6) M), a nonselective antagonist. The selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (0.3 x 10(-6) M) did not have any effect. Secretion of GENEIN protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of CHEMICALIN followed a similar pattern as observed for GENEIN mRNA. In addition, the GENEIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN mRNA accumulation and GENEIN protein secretion were related to the accumulation of intracellular CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) levels. Although GENENOTIN mRNA was detectable in GENENOTIN-activated T lymphocytes, we could not demonstrate a functional activity in the regulation of GENENOTIN expression: the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN had no effect on the accumulation of the studied GENENOTIN mRNAs, and did not significantly affect cellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels. These data demonstrate that beta-agonist-induced inhibition of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA accumulation is solely mediated by GENENOTIN.
9760035	GENEIN binding and uterotonic activity of CHEMICALIN and its metabolites following enzymatic degradation. Metabolites of the analogue CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) following incubation with a rat kidney homogenate were isolated and their pharmacodynamic properties investigated. Apart from the parent compound two metabolites were identified namely CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite I) and CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite II). Both CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN metabolite I and CHEMICALIN metabolite II displayed binding affinities to the myometrial GENEIN of a similar magnitude as CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was found to have agonistic properties on isolated myometrial strips and it was found to exert this effect through generation of CHEMICALNOTIN, as is the case for CHEMICALNOTIN. However, maximal contractile effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was approximately 50% lower than that of CHEMICALNOTIN (2.70 +/- 0.12 g compared to 5.22 +/- 0.26 g) and EC50 was approximately ten times higher (48.0 +/- 8.20 nM compared to 5.62 +/- 1.22 nM). Neither CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite I nor CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite II were able to contract isolated myometrial tissue. All three compounds displayed antagonistic properties against GENEIN in vitro, with CHEMICALIN being the strongest inhibitor (pA2 = 8.21) and CHEMICALIN metabolite II (pA2 = 8.01) being stronger than CHEMICALIN metabolite I (pA2 = 7.81). These results indicate that CHEMICALIN is a partial agonist/antagonist to the GENEIN while the two metabolites CHEMICALIN metabolite I and CHEMICALIN metabolite II are pure antagonists. All three analogues bound to the myometrial GENENOTIN, albeit with much lower affinities than to the GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite II showed the weakest binding affinity of 33.7 +/- 7.34 nM compared to 7.24 +/- 0.29 nM for CHEMICALNOTIN and 9.89 + 2.80 nM for CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite I. Only CHEMICALIN bound to the renal GENEIN though the binding affinity was very low (61.3 +/- 14.6 nM).
9843368	Crystallographic analysis of the GENEIN with bound CHEMICALIN inhibitors at 2.0 A resolution. The GENEIN represent a superfamily of structurally and functionally closely related enzymes, one of those functions being reversible inhibition by CHEMICALIN derivatives. Here we present the crystal structure of the dimeric catalytic domain (residues 117-424) of GENEIN (GENEIN), cocrystallized with various potent and well-known CHEMICALIN inhibitors and refined at a resolution of 2.0 A. The CHEMICALNOTIN bind by bidentate coordination to each CHEMICALNOTIN in both subunits of the dimer through the CHEMICALNOTIN groups, forming a blue-green colored ligand-to-metal charge-transfer complex. In addition, Glu330 and Tyr325 are identified as determinant residues in the recognition of the inhibitors. In particular, the interaction with Glu330 conforms to the structural explanation for the pH dependence of CHEMICALNOTIN binding to CHEMICALNOTIN, with a pKa value of 5.1 (20 degreesC). The overall structure of the CHEMICALNOTIN-bound enzyme is very similar to that of the uncomplexed enzyme (rms difference of 0.2 A for the Calpha atoms). Most striking is the replacement of two iron-bound water molecules with CHEMICALNOTIN groups. This change is consistent with a change in the ligand field symmetry of the high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) from a rhombic to a nearly axial ligand field symmetry as seen upon CHEMICALNOTIN binding using EPR spectroscopy [Martinez, A., Andersson, K. K., Haavik, J., and Flatmark, T. (1991) Eur. J. Biochem. 198, 675-682]. Crystallographic comparison with the structurally related GENEIN binary complex with the oxidized cofactor CHEMICALIN revealed overlapping binding sites for the CHEMICALIN and the cofactor, compatible with a competitive type of inhibition of the CHEMICALIN versus BH4. The comparison demonstrates some structural differences at the active site as the potential basis for the different substrate specificity of the two enzymes.
9891987	Various glucocorticoids differ in their ability to induce gene expression, apoptosis and to repress GENENOTIN-dependent transcription. Glucocorticoids (GCs) influence a great variety of cellular functions by at least three important modes of action: the activation (or repression) of genes controlled by binding sites for the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the induction of apoptosis in lymphocytes and the recently discovered cross-talk to other transcription factors such as GENENOTIN. In this study we systematically compared various natural and synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN hormones frequently used as therapeutic agents on their ability to mediate these three modes of action. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN turned out to be the best inducers of gene expression and apoptosis. All GCs including the antagonistic compound CHEMICALIN efficiently reduced GENEIN-mediated transactivation to comparable extents, suggesting that ligand-induced nuclear localization of the GENEIN is sufficient for transrepression. Glucocorticoid treatment of cells did not result in elevated GENENOTIN expression, but impaired the GENENOTIN-induced degradation of GENENOTIN without affecting DNA binding of GENENOTIN. The structural requirements for the various functions of glucocorticoids are discussed.
9990013	Cooperative binding of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN in the GENEIN is modulated by CHEMICALIN. The GENENOTIN in pancreatic beta cells are critical in the regulation of CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN secretion. Although electrophysiological studies provide clues to the complex control of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and pharmacological agents, the molecular mechanism of GENENOTIN regulation remains unclear. The GENENOTIN is a heterooligomeric complex of GENENOTIN subunits of the CHEMICALIN-binding-cassette superfamily with two GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN) and the pore-forming GENENOTIN subunits. Here, we report that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, but not the CHEMICALIN salt of CHEMICALIN, stabilize the binding of prebound CHEMICALIN to GENEIN. Mutation in the GENEIN of GENEIN of GENEIN abolished this stabilizing effect of CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that GENEIN binds CHEMICALIN strongly at GENEIN and that CHEMICALIN, either by direct binding to GENEIN or by hydrolysis of bound CHEMICALIN at GENEIN, stabilizes prebound CHEMICALIN binding at GENEIN. The CHEMICALIN caused release of prebound CHEMICALIN from GENEIN in the presence of CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN in a concentration-dependent manner. This direct biochemical evidence of cooperative interaction in CHEMICALIN binding of the two GENEIN of GENEIN suggests that CHEMICALIN both blocks this cooperative binding of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN and, in cooperation with the CHEMICALIN bound at GENEIN, causes CHEMICALNOTIN to be released from GENEIN.
