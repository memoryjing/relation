CPR:1	Several site-specific alterations in the  bbbbb1 CHEMICALIN eeeee1 -terminus of full-length  bbbbb2 GENEIN eeeee2 , an isoform that otherwise absolutely rejects GENENOTIN, resulted in gain of GENENOTIN binding
CPR:1	GENENOTIN and the  bbbbb1 CHEMICALIN eeeee1 -terminus of  bbbbb2 GENEIN eeeee2  are dispensable for high-affinity binding of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN
CPR:2	These results suggest that a complex of  bbbbb1 GENEIN eeeee1  and heparan  bbbbb2 CHEMICALIN eeeee2  is the base common active core of the GENENOTIN and that flanking structural domains modify GENENOTIN affinity and determine specificity.
CPR:2	Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan  bbbbb1 CHEMICALIN eeeee1  binding site resides in a distinct sequence in  bbbbb2 GENEIN eeeee2  of the three modules of GENEIN

CPR:6	In another experiment,  bbbbb1 CHEMICALIN eeeee1 , an antagonist of the  bbbbb2 GENEIN eeeee2 , also prolonged the clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN from the CA3 region
CPR:9	From these data, it is inferred that both the  bbbbb1 GENEIN eeeee1  and GENEIN contribute to the active clearance of exogenously applied  bbbbb2 CHEMICALIN eeeee2  in the dentate gyrus
CPR:9	From these data, it is inferred that both the GENEIN and  bbbbb1 GENEIN eeeee1  contribute to the active clearance of exogenously applied  bbbbb2 CHEMICALIN eeeee2  in the dentate gyrus
CPR:9	These and other data have generated a working hypothesis that activation of the terminal GENEIN enhances the kinetics of  bbbbb1 CHEMICALIN eeeee1  uptake through an effect on the  bbbbb2 GENEIN eeeee2 .
