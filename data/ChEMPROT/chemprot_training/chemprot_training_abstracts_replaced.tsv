16357751	Selective costimulation modulators: a novel approach for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. T cells have a central role in the orchestration of the immune pathways that contribute to the inflammation and joint destruction characteristic of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The requirement for a dual signal for T-cell activation and the construction of a fusion protein that prevents engagement of the costimulatory molecules required for this activation has led to a new approach to RA therapy. This approach is mechanistically distinct from other currently used therapies; it targets events early rather than late in the immune cascade, and it results in immunomodulation rather than complete immunosuppression. The fusion protein abatacept is a selective costimulation modulator that avidly binds to the CD80/CD86 ligands on an antigen-presenting cell, resulting in the inability of these ligands to engage the CD28 receptor on the T cell. Abatacept dose-dependently reduces T-cell proliferation, serum concentrations of acute-phase reactants, and other markers of inflammation, including the production of rheumatoid factor by B cells. Recent studies have provided consistent evidence that treatment with abatacept results in a rapid onset of efficacy that is maintained over the course of treatment in patients with inadequate response to methotrexate and anti-tumor necrosis factor therapies. This efficacy includes patient-centered outcomes and radiographic measurement of disease progression. Abatacept has also demonstrated a very favorable safety profile to date. This article reviews the rationale for this therapeutic approach and highlights some of the recent studies that demonstrate the benefits obtained by using abatacept. This clinical experience indicates that abatacept is a significant addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the management of patients with RA.
14967461	Emerging role of GENENOTIN inhibition in therapy for advanced malignancy: focus on NSCLC. Combination chemotherapy regimens have emerged as the standard approach in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Meta-analyses have demonstrated a 2-month increase in median survival after CHEMICALNOTIN-based therapy vs. best supportive care, and an absolute 10% improvement in the 1-year survival rate. Just as importantly, cytotoxic therapy has produced benefits in symptom control and quality of life. Newer agents, including the CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, have expanded our therapeutic options in the treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer. Despite their contributions, we have reached a therapeutic plateau, with response rates seldom exceeding 30-40% in cooperative group studies and 1-year survival rates stable between 30% and 40%. It is doubtful that substituting one agent for another in various combinations will lead to any further improvement in these rates. The thrust of current research has focused on targeted therapy, and GENENOTIN inhibition is one of the most promising clinical strategies. GENEIN inhibitors currently under investigation include the small molecules CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN). Agents that have only begun to undergo clinical evaluation include CHEMICALIN, an irreversible pan-GENEIN GENEIN inhibitor, and CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, both examples of dual GENEIN inhibitors (inhibiting GENEIN and GENEIN). Preclinical models have demonstrated synergy for all these agents in combination with either chemotherapy or radiotherapy, leading to great enthusiasm regarding their ultimate contribution to lung cancer therapy. However, serious clinical challenges persist. These include the identification of the optimal dose(s); the proper integration of these agents into popular, established cytotoxic regimens; and the selection of the optimal setting(s) in which to test these compounds. Both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN have shown clinical activity in pretreated, advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, but placebo-controlled randomized Phase III studies evaluating CHEMICALNOTIN in combination with standard cytotoxic therapy, to our chagrin, have failed to demonstrate a survival advantage compared with chemotherapy alone.
23468099	Effects of chronic social defeat stress on behavior and choline acetyltransferase, 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, and CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) homologous protein in adult mice. RATIONALE: Social defeat stress induces physiological and behavioral symptoms, including anxiety, anhedonia, immune deficits, and altered expression of key brain genes. OBJECTIVES: The present study investigated the effects of social defeat stress on the behaviors and expressions of Chat, Grp78, and chop in the brains of adult mice. METHODS: Adult mice were divided into susceptible and unsusceptible groups after 10Â days of social defeat stress. In experiment 1, behavioral tests were conducted, and brains were processed for Western blotting at day 27 after stress. In experiment 2, social avoidance tests were conducted, and brains were processed for Western blotting at day 12 after stress. RESULTS: The results indicate decreased and increased locomotion and anxiety behavior in all defeated mice. Decrease in social interaction, increased immobility, and impaired memory performance were only observed in susceptible mice. A decrease in the Chat level at days 12 and 27 was noted in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), amygdala (Amyg), and dorsal hippocampus (HIP) in defeated mice. The expression levels of Grp78 and chop measured on days 12 and 27 were significantly greater in the Amyg of susceptible mice. In the PFC and HIP, defeated mice displayed different patterns in the levels of Grp78 and chop expressions measured on days 12 and 27. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated that chronic social defeat stress in mice produces stress-related behaviors. Different response patterns were noted for Grp78 and chop expression among the groups in terms of brain regions and time-course effects.
23293962	Hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor type 2 (HAI-2) modulates hepcidin expression by inhibiting the cell surface protease matriptase-2. Matriptase-2, a recently identified cell surface protease, is the key enzyme of iron homoeostasis modulating the expression of the liver peptide hormone hepcidin. HAI (hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor) types 1 and 2 (HAI-1 and HAI-2 respectively) have been shown to inhibit the close homologue, i.e. matriptase. By co-expressing matriptase-2 and the inhibitor HAI-2 we have identified HAI-2 displaying high inhibitory potential against matriptase-2 at the cell surface as well as in conditioned medium. Accordingly, complex formation between matriptase-2 and HAI-2 was demonstrated by isolation of the complex via immobilizing either HAI-2 or matriptase-2 from lysates and conditioned medium of co-expressing cells. Furthermore, HAI-2 indirectly influences the expression of the hepcidin-encoding gene HAMP. The inhibitor abrogates the matriptase-2-mediated suppression of HAMP expression, presumably by inhibiting the supposed potential of matriptase-2 to cleave membrane-bound HJV (haemojuvelin). Taken together, the results of the present study have characterized HAI-2 as an inhibitor of matriptase-2 that modulates the synthesis of hepcidin and provides new insights into the regulatory mechanism of iron homoeostasis, with clinical importance for a treatment of iron overload diseases.
7678677	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are competitive slowly reversible antagonists at the GENEIN of rat left atria. We studied the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on rat left atria. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN at 10(-7), 3 x 10(-7), and 10(-6) M inhibited the cardiac stimulation response slightly, which is indicative of membrane-stabilizing activity independent of GENEIN blockade. This membrane-stabilizing activity was readily reversible. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN also caused surmountable antagonism of CHEMICALIN responses, and this GENEIN antagonism was slowly reversible. Inhibition of the CHEMICALNOTIN responses with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN at 10(-6) M was at equilibrium after 60 min, which is indicative of reversible antagonism. We conclude that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are competitive slowly reversible GENEIN antagonists on rat left atria.
16554356	Covalent linkage of GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN nanoparticles strongly enhances drug transport into the brain. Drug delivery to the brain is becoming more and more important but is severely restricted by the blood-brain barrier. Nanoparticles coated with CHEMICALNOTIN have previously been shown to enable the transport of several drugs across the blood-brain barrier, which under normal circumstances is impermeable to these compounds. GENENOTIN was suggested to mediate this drug transport across the blood-brain barrier. In the present study, GENENOTIN was coupled by chemical methods to nanoparticles made of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-NP). CHEMICALNOTIN, which does not cross the blood-brain barrier but exerts antinociceptive effects after direct injection into the brain, was used as model drug. GENEIN was chemically bound via linkers to CHEMICALIN-loaded GENEIN-NP. This preparation induced antinociceptive effects in the tail-flick test in ICR mice after i.v. injection. In contrast, nanoparticles linked to GENENOTIN variants that do not recognize GENENOTIN failed to induce these effects. These results indicate that GENENOTIN attached to the surface of nanoparticles facilitates transport of drugs across the blood-brain barrier, probably after interaction with GENENOTIN on the brain capillary endothelial cell membranes.
16789740	Discovery and optimization of CHEMICALIN as inhibitors of GENEIN: a structural basis for the reduction of GENEIN binding. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a novel target for cancer therapy. As part of an effort to discover orally active reversible inhibitors of GENEIN, a series of CHEMICALIN with micromolar affinities for GENEIN were identified using affinity selection by mass spectrometry (ASMS) screening. These micromolar hits were rapidly improved to nanomolar leads on the basis of insights from protein crystallography; however, the compounds displayed extensive binding to GENENOTIN and had limited activity in cellular assays. Modifications based on structural information on the binding of lead compounds to both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN allowed the identification of compounds with significant improvements in both parameters, which showed good cellular activity in both proliferation and CHEMICALNOTIN processing assays.
7526860	Keratinocyte growth factor and acidic fibroblast growth factor are mitogens for primary cultures of mammary epithelium. Mammary epithelial cells derived from the entire mammary parenchyma or only end buds were isolated by collagenase digestion of mammary glands from virgin mice. Cells were cultured within collagen gels in serum-free medium containing insulin. Keratinocyte growth factor (KGF or FGF-7) and acidic fibroblast growth factor (aFGF or FGF-1) stimulated multifold proliferation when added alone to this medium. Growth occurred as three-dimensional colonies within the collagen gel matrix. KGF stimulated growth was unaffected by adding heparin. Conversely, multifold growth stimulation by acidic FGF required heparin. Since end buds are the actively proliferating cell population of ductal glands, organ cultures of these structures were prepared. KGF stimulated 3H-thymidine incorporation in these end buds in the absence and presence of epidermal growth factor. These data suggest that acidic FGF and KGF may represent in vivo stromal factors capable of regulating mammary gland development.
17199504	Configuration of a scintillation proximity assay for the activity assessment of recombinant GENENOTIN. GENEIN plays a role in CHEMICALNOTIN salvage by catalyzing the direct conversion of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN. The involvement of the CHEMICALNOTIN salvage pathway in tumor proliferation and angiogenesis makes GENENOTIN a potential target for oncology drug discovery. We have expressed and characterized recombinant, CHEMICALIN-terminally CHEMICALNOTIN-tagged GENEIN. Two assay formats were assessed for use in a high throughput screen: a spectrophotometric-based enzyme-coupled assay system and a radiometric ionic capture scintillation proximity bead assay format. Ultimately, the scintillation proximity assay format was chosen because of automated screening compatibility limitations of the coupled assay. We describe here the biochemical characterization of GENENOTIN and the development of a robust, homogeneous, 384-well assay suitable for high throughput screening.
16437532	GENENOTIN inhibitors for Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the first GENEIN inhibitor (ChEI) in 1997, most clinicians and probably most patients would consider the cholinergic drugs, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.The drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties, but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of CHEMICALIN, an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, by blocking the enzyme GENEIN. The most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Cochrane reviews of each ChEI for Alzheimer's disease have been completed (Birks 2005, Birks 2005b and Loy 2005). Despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience the debate on whether ChEIs are effective continues. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched using the terms 'CHEMICALNOTIN', 'CHEMICALNOTIN' , 'CHEMICALNOTIN' , CHEMICALNOTIN* CHEMICALNOTIN* CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, "CHEMICALNOTIN" and CHEMICALNOTIN on 12 June 2005. This Register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a ChEI was compared with placebo or another ChEI for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. MAIN RESULTS: The results of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for periods of 6 months and one year, with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN at the recommended dose for people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average -2.7 points (95%CI -3.0 to -2.3), in the midrange of the 70 point ADAS-Cog Scale. Study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. None of these treatment effects are large. There is nothing to suggest the effects are less for patients with severe dementia or mild dementia, although there is very little evidence for other than mild to moderate dementia.More patients leave ChEI treatment groups, approximately 29 %, on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups (18%). There is evidence of more adverse events in total in the patients treated with a ChEI than with placebo. Although many types of adverse event were reported, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the ChEI groups than in placebo. There are four studies, all supported by one of the pharmaceutical companies, in which two ChEIs were compared, two studies of CHEMICALNOTIN compared with CHEMICALNOTIN, and two of CHEMICALNOTIN compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. In three studies the patients were not blinded to treatment, only the fourth, DON vs RIV/Bullock is double blind. Two of the studies provide little evidence, they are of 12 weeks duration, which is barely long enough to complete the drug titration. There is no evidence from DON vs GAL/Wilcock of a treatment difference between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN at 52 weeks for cognition, activities of daily living, the numbers who leave the trial before the end of treatment, the number who suffer any adverse event, or any specific adverse event. There is no evidence from DON vs RIV/Bullock of a difference between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN for cognitive function, activities of daily living and behavioural disturbance at two years. Fewer patients suffer adverse events on CHEMICALNOTIN than CHEMICALNOTIN. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The three GENENOTIN inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not possible to identify those who will respond to treatment prior to treatment. There is no evidence that treatment with a ChEI is not cost effective. Despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three GENENOTIN inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy. There appears to be less adverse effects associated with CHEMICALNOTIN compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. It may be that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN match CHEMICALNOTIN in tolerability if a careful and gradual titration routine over more than three months is used. Titration with CHEMICALNOTIN is more straightforward and the lower dose may be worth consideration.
11716850	The effects of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a new anti-diabetic drug, on GENEIN and GENEIN secretion: comparison with the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a new anti-diabetic drug, is thought to stimulate GENEIN secretion by closing the GENEIN in pancreatic beta-cells. However, its selectivity for the various GENENOTIN is not known. In this study, we examined the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on various cloned GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) reconstituted in COS-1 cells, and compared them to another CHEMICALNOTIN-related compound, CHEMICALNOTIN. Patch-clamp analysis using inside-out recording configuration showed that CHEMICALIN inhibits the GENEIN/GENEIN channel currents in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 value, 100 nM) but does not significantly inhibit either GENEIN/GENEIN or GENEIN/GENEIN channel currents even at high doses (more than 10 microM). CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN channels at 100 nM, and inhibits GENEIN/GENEIN channels at high concentrations (1 microM). Binding experiments on CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN to GENEIN expressed in COS-1 cells revealed that they inhibit the binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN (IC50 values: CHEMICALIN, 280 nM; CHEMICALIN, 8 microM; CHEMICALIN, 1.6 microM), suggesting that they all share a CHEMICALIN binding site. The GENEIN responses to CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN in MIN6 cells after chronic CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN treatment were comparable to those after chronic CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN treatment. These results indicate that, similar to the CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN is highly specific to the GENEIN/GENEIN complex, i.e., the pancreatic beta-cell GENEIN, and suggest that CHEMICALIN may be a clinically useful anti-diabetic drug.
23487168	A systematic comparison of the properties of clinically used GENENOTIN antagonists. GENENOTIN antagonists (ARBs) have become an important drug class in the treatment of hypertension and heart failure and the protection from diabetic nephropathy. Eight ARBs are clinically available [CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN]. CHEMICALNOTIN (in some countries), CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN are orally administered as prodrugs, whereas the blocking action of some is mediated through active metabolites. On the basis of their chemical structures, ARBs use different binding pockets in the receptor, which are associated with differences in dissociation times and, in most cases, apparently insurmountable antagonism. The physicochemical differences between ARBs also manifest in different tissue penetration, including passage through the blood-brain barrier. Differences in binding mode and tissue penetration are also associated with differences in pharmacokinetic profile, particularly duration of action. Although generally highly specific for GENEIN, some ARBs, particularly CHEMICALIN, are partial agonists at GENEIN. All of these properties are comprehensively reviewed in this article. Although there is general consensus that a continuous receptor blockade over a 24-hour period is desirable, the clinical relevance of other pharmacological differences between individual ARBs remains to be assessed.
23019138	Diuretic effects of cannabinoids. In vivo effects of cannabinoid (CB) agonists are often assessed using four well-established measures: locomotor activity, hypothermia, cataleptic-like effects, and analgesia. The present studies demonstrate that doses of CB agonists that produce these effects also reliably increase diuresis. Diuretic effects of several CB agonists were measured in female rats over 2 hours immediately after drug injection, and results were compared with hypothermic effects. Direct-acting GENEIN agonists, including CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], and CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], produced dose-dependent increases in diuresis and decreases in colonic temperature, with slightly lower ED(50) values for diuresis than for hypothermia. The highest doses of cannabinoid drugs yielded, on average, 26-32 g/kg urine; comparable effects were obtained with 10 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN and 3.0 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN (10.0 mg/kg) had lesser effect than other CB agonists, and the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN], the CHEMICALNOTIN transport inhibitor CHEMICALIN, and the CB antagonist CHEMICALNOTIN did not have diuretic effects. In further studies, the diuretic effects of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN were similar in male and female rats, displayed a relatively rapid onset to action, and were dose-dependently antagonized by 30 minutes pretreatment with CHEMICALIN, but not by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, nor were the effects of CHEMICALIN antagonized by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN]. These data indicate that cannabinoids have robust diuretic effects in rats that are mediated via GENENOTIN receptor mechanisms.
12065695	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce apoptosis in association with activation of GENENOTIN in rheumatoid synovial cells. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to induce apoptosis in a variety of cell lines. In this study, we examined the effect of NSAIDs on the growth and apoptosis of synovial cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and analyzed the activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a possible mechanism of action of NSAIDs. Cell proliferation and viability were assessed from CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation and by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) assay, respectively. The apoptosis of synovial cells was identified by DNA fragmentation assay and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling assay. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN reduced cell proliferation and induced apoptotic cell death in synovial cells, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN did not. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a selective GENEIN inhibitor, also inhibited cell proliferation, whereas it did not cause apoptosis. Rheumatoid synovial cells expressed GENEIN mRNA, and the GENEIN ligands CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN reduced the proliferation and induced apoptosis in synovial cells. Luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that not only GENENOTIN ligands but also NSAIDs, which could induce apoptosis, increased the activation of GENENOTIN in synovial cells. Furthermore, the ability of NSAIDs and GENENOTIN ligands to stimulate the activation of GENENOTIN correlated with their ability to decrease cell viability(r = 0.92, p < 0.01) and ability to induce DNA fragmentation (r = 0.97, p < 0.001) in synovial cells. These results suggest that GENENOTIN is an attractive target for induction of apoptosis in rheumatoid synovial cells and that the activation of the GENENOTIN pathway is associated with the apoptotic action of NSAIDs.
23214423	Anisotropy of chemical bonding in semifluorinated graphite C2F revealed with angle-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Highly oriented pyrolytic graphite characterized by a low misorientation of crystallites is fluorinated using a gaseous mixture of BrF(3) with Br(2) at room temperature. The golden-colored product, easily delaminating into micrometer-size transparent flakes, is an intercalation compound where Br(2) molecules are hosted between fluorinated graphene layers of approximate C(2)F composition. To unravel the chemical bonding in semifluorinated graphite, we apply angle-resolved near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy and quantum-chemical modeling. The strong angular dependence of the CK and FK edge NEXAFS spectra on the incident radiation indicates that room-temperature-produced graphite fluoride is a highly anisotropic material, where half of the carbon atoms are covalently bonded with fluorine, while the rest of the carbon atoms preserve Ï electrons. Comparison of the experimental CK edge spectrum with theoretical spectra plotted for C(2)F models reveals that fluorine atoms are more likely to form chains. This conclusion agrees with the atomic force microscopy observation of a chain-like pattern on the surface of graphite fluoride layers.
16840830	Two novel mutations in the GENENOTIN gene in subjects with multiple endocrine neoplasia-1. Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (GENENOTIN) is characterized by parathyroid, enteropancreatic endocrine and pituitary adenomas as well as germline mutation of the GENENOTIN gene. We describe 2 families with GENENOTIN with novel mutations in the GENENOTIN gene. One family was of Turkish origin, and the index patient had primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) plus a prolactinoma; three relatives had PHPT only. The index patient in the second family was a 46-yr-old woman of Chinese origin living in Taiwan. This patient presented with a complaint of epigastric pain and watery diarrhea over the past 3 months, and had undergone subtotal parathyroidectomy and enucleation of pancreatic islet cell tumor about 10 yr before. There was also a prolactinoma. Sequence analysis of the GENENOTIN gene from leukocyte genomic DNA revealed heterozygous mutations in both probands. The Turkish patient and her affected relatives all had a heterozygous GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of exon 10 of GENEIN that results in a replacement of CHEMICALIN by CHEMICALIN. The Chinese index patient and one of her siblings had a heterozygous mutation at codon 418 of exon 9 (GENENOTIN) that results in a substitution of CHEMICALNOTIN by CHEMICALNOTIN. In conclusion, we have identified 2 novel missense mutations in the GENENOTIN gene.
15736931	Mutation of CHEMICALIN 228 to CHEMICALIN enhances the GENEIN activity of GENEIN. GENEIN (GENEIN) normally transfers CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALNOTIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN ion (GENEIN activity) and also transfers CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALNOTIN (GENEIN activity), albeit at only 0.3% efficiency. In addition, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) enhances this GENENOTIN activity more than 25 times. Comparison of the crystal structures of CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-bound GENEIN reveals that the CHEMICALNOTIN group in both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN moieties forms a CHEMICALNOTIN bond with the side chain CHEMICALIN group of Glu317. The orientation of the CHEMICALIN causes a steric hindrance to the side chain CHEMICALIN group of Glu317, accounting for the enzyme's low GENEIN activity. In this study, we show that mutation of Arg228, a residue in the vicinity of Glu317, to CHEMICALIN (GENENOTIN-GENEIN) results in a 15-fold higher GENEIN activity, which is further enhanced by LA to nearly 25% of the GENEIN activity of the wild type. The kinetic parameters indicate that the main effect of the mutation of Arg228 to CHEMICALIN is on the k(cat) of GENEIN, which increases 3-4-fold, both in the absence and in the presence of LA; simultaneously, the k(cat) for the GENENOTIN reaction is reduced 30-fold. The crystal structure of GENEIN-GENEIN complexed with LA, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN determined at 1.9 A resolution shows that the Asp318 side chain exhibits a minor alternate conformation, compared to that in the wild type. This alternate conformation now causes a steric hindrance to the CHEMICALIN group of the CHEMICALIN moiety of CHEMICALIN, probably causing the dissociation of CHEMICALIN and the reduced k(cat) of the GENEIN reaction.
23414802	Discovery of novel CHEMICALIN derivatives as GENEIN inhibitors. GENENOTIN is a novel GENENOTIN that has been implicated in the invasion and metastasis of colon cancer cells. In this study, a novel series of CHEMICALIN derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for inhibiting GENEIN GENEIN activity and suppressing cancer cell invasion. These derivatives demonstrated good inhibitory activity against GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, which correlated with the promising anti-invasive activity of colon cancer cells overexpressing GENENOTIN.
23578689	Conformationally restricted homotryptamines. Part 6: Indole-5-cycloalkyl methylamines as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Racemic 5-(trans-2-aminomethylcyclopropyl)indoles, 5-(trans-2-aminomethylcyclopentyl) indoles, and 5-(cis-2-aminomethylcyclopentyl)indoles were synthesized and evaluated as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. These analogs followed SAR trends similar to those previously reported for 3-cycloalkyl substituted indoles. The most potent analogs exhibited single digit nanomolar inhibition at the human serotonin transporter but were 10-fold less active than the previously reported compounds.
15908512	GENENOTIN-mediated enhancement of hippocampal CA3 network activity. CHEMICALNOTIN is an endogenous neurotransmitter distributed throughout the mammalian brain. In higher cortical structures such as the hippocampus, CHEMICALIN, via GENEIN (GENEIN) activation, has been shown to reinforce the cognitive processes of attention and memory. In this study, we investigated the effect of GENENOTIN activation on hippocampal cornu ammonis 3 (CA3) network activity. GENENOTIN expression was first determined using immunocytochemistry with antibodies against GENENOTIN, which were found to be exceptionally dense in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons. CA3 network activity was then examined in vitro using field potential recordings in rat brain slices. The selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN caused an enhancement of hippocampal CA3 network activity, as measured by an increase in frequency of spontaneous burst discharges recorded in the CA3 region. In the presence of GENENOTIN blockade, concentration-response curves for CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN suggested that a GENEIN was involved in this response, and the rank order of potency was CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN = CHEMICALIN. Finally, equilibrium dissociation constants (pK(b)) of subtype-selective GENENOTIN antagonists were functionally determined to characterize the GENENOTIN subtype modulating hippocampal CA3 activity. The selective GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN blocked CHEMICALIN-induced enhancement, with apparent K(b) values of 85 +/- 36 and 3.9 +/- 1.7 nM, respectively. In contrast, the selective GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited CHEMICALIN-mediated enhancement with apparent low affinities (K(b) of 222 +/- 61 and 9268 +/- 512 nM, respectively). Together, this pharmacological profile of subtype-selective GENENOTIN antagonists indicates that in this model, GENEIN activation is responsible for the enhanced hippocampal CA3 network activity initiated by CHEMICALIN.
14507899	GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN enhances functional recovery after detachment caused by subretinal injection in normal and rds mice. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the recovery of CHEMICALNOTIN function after experimental CHEMICALNOTIN detachment induced by subretinal injection. METHODS: Subretinal injections of 1 micro L of fluorescent microbeads, saline, or CHEMICALNOTIN (1-200 micro M) were made by the transvitreal method in normal (C57BL/6) mice and in mice heterozygous for the CHEMICALNOTIN degeneration slow (rds) gene. Control, mock-injected animals underwent corneal puncture without injection. Histologic and ERG evaluations were made at 0 to 1 and 8 hours, and 1, 3, 7, 10, 14, and 60 days post injection (PI). DNA fragmentation was evaluated by terminal CHEMICALNOTIN transferase-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: A single subretinal injection of saline solution containing fluorescent beads caused a histologically evident retinal detachment and distributed the microbeads to almost all the subretinal space. Spontaneous reattachment occurred within 24 hours after injection and was accompanied by evident CHEMICALNOTIN folding that appeared largely resolved by 6 days later. Relative to controls, injection of saline resulted in approximately 40% recovery of dark-adapted a-wave amplitude at 24 hours PI and gradually improved to approximately 90% of controls at 2 months PI. Subretinal injection of saline containing CHEMICALNOTIN (10 micro M) significantly increased rod and cone ERG of normal and rds(+/-) mice at 1 and 10 days PI, when compared with injection of saline alone. Additionally, CHEMICALNOTIN reduced the number of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors and the enhanced rate of reattachment. CONCLUSIONS: Enhancement of ERG recovery by CHEMICALNOTIN is likely due to reduced CHEMICALNOTIN folding and cell death associated with detachment. These results support the use of CHEMICALNOTIN to help restore function after therapies that involve subretinal administration of drugs in animal models of CHEMICALNOTIN diseases.
12904467	Selective antagonism of GENEIN GENEIN-mediated synaptic currents by CHEMICALIN in rat basolateral amygdala neurons. CHEMICALNOTIN is a widely used antiepileptic agent whose mechanism of action is poorly understood. The drug has been reported to interact with various GENENOTIN types, including GENENOTIN. In whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings from principal neurons of the rat basolateral amygdala, CHEMICALIN at low concentrations (IC50, approximately 0.5 microm) selectively inhibited pharmacologically isolated excitatory synaptic currents mediated by GENEIN containing the GENEIN subunit. CHEMICALIN also partially depressed predominantly GENEIN-mediated EPSCs, but with lower efficacy. CHEMICALNOTIN did not alter the degree of facilitation in paired-pulse experiments, and it reduced the amplitude of miniature EPSCs without affecting their frequency, demonstrating that the block of synaptic responses occurs postsynaptically. Inhibition of GENEIN GENEIN could represent a key mechanism underlying the anticonvulsant activity of CHEMICALIN. Moreover, these results support the concept that GENENOTIN GENENOTIN represent a novel target for antiepileptic drug development.
23210783	From traditional European medicine to discovery of new drug candidates for the treatment of dementia and Alzheimer's disease: acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. The leading Alzheimer's disease (AD) therapeutics to date involves inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which should, in principle, elevate cholinergic signaling and limit inflammation. In spite of the effectiveness in 20%-30% of AD patients, more attention has been paid to find new anti-AChE agents from medicinal plants. Galanthamine, contained in the bulbs and flowers of Galanthus and related genera like Narcissus, represents a good example. The aim of this study is to review the role of possible AChE inhibitors (AChEI) present in plants traditionally used in European medicine for improving memory. Starting from Galanthamine, properties of Melissa species, Salvia officinalis, Arnica chamissonis and Ruta graveolens are discussed to point to the role of these plants as potential sources for the development of therapeutic agents for AD.
10606746	Structure of GENEIN complexed with CHEMICALIN at 2.3 A resolution. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), an alkaloid from the flower, the common snowdrop (Galanthus nivalis), shows anticholinesterase activity. This property has made GAL the target of research as to its effectiveness in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. We have solved the X-ray crystal structure of GAL bound in the active site of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) to 2.3 A resolution. The inhibitor binds at the base of the active site gorge of GENEIN, interacting with both the GENEIN (CHEMICALIN-84) and the GENEIN (CHEMICALIN-288, CHEMICALIN-290). The CHEMICALNOTIN group of GAL does not interact closely with CHEMICALNOTIN-84; rather, the double bond of its CHEMICALNOTIN ring stacks against the CHEMICALNOTIN ring. The tertiary amine appears to make a non-conventional CHEMICALNOTIN bond, via its CHEMICALNOTIN group, to CHEMICALNOTIN-72, near the top of the gorge. The CHEMICALNOTIN group of the inhibitor makes a strong CHEMICALNOTIN bond (2.7 A) with CHEMICALNOTIN-199. The relatively tight binding of GAL to GENENOTIN appears to arise from a number of moderate to weak interactions with the protein, coupled to a low entropy cost for binding due to the rigid nature of the inhibitor.
16851960	CHEMICALNOTIN transfer in GENENOTIN. A theoretical study. Density functional theory calculations using the hybrid functional B3LYP have been performed to study the CHEMICALIN transfer step in GENEIN (GENEIN). This enzyme catalyzes the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-dependent methylation of CHEMICALNOTIN to form CHEMICALNOTIN. The starting point for the calculations is the recent X-ray crystal structure of GENEIN complexed with CHEMICALIN and acetate. Several quantum chemical models with different sizes, employing up to 98 atoms, were used. The calculations demonstrate that the suggested mechanism, where the methyl group is transferred in a single S(N)2 step, is thermodynamically plausible. By adding or eliminating various groups at the active site, it was furthermore demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN bonds to the CHEMICALNOTIN group of the CHEMICALNOTIN substrate lower the reaction barrier, while CHEMICALNOTIN bonds to the CHEMICALNOTIN group raise the barrier.
23643542	Water extract of licorice had anti-viral activity against human respiratory syncytial virus in human respiratory tract cell lines. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Licorice (Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., Leguminosae) has been used in herbal medicine and food supplement worldwide for centuries. Licorice is a common ingredient of several prescriptions of traditional Chinese medicine which have been proved to inhibit infection of human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV). There are two preparations of licorice, Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata. However, it is unknown whether licorice or which preparation of licorice is effective against HRSV, nor is its active constituent. AIM OF THE STUDY: We tested the hypothesis that Radix Glycyrrhizae can effectively decrease HRSV-induced plaque formation in respiratory mucosal cell lines. We also tried to find out the active constituent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anti-HRSV activities of hot water extracts of preparations of licorice, glycyrrhizin and 18Î²-glycyrrhetinic acid (18Î²-GA), the active constituents of licorice, were examined by plaque reduction assay in both human upper (HEp-2) and low (A549) respiratory tract cell lines. Abilities of crude licorice to inhibit viral replication and to stimulate IFN-Î² were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. RESULTS: Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata dose-dependently inhibited HRSV-induced plaque formation in both HEp-2 and A549 cell lines (p<0.0001). The effect of Radix Glycyrrhizae was better than that of Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata on HEp-2 cells. However, there was no difference of their anti-HRSV effects on A549 cells. Besides, glycyrrhizin was ineffective at all. Nevertheless, 18Î²-GA showed a potent anti-HRSV activity. Radix Glycyrrhizae was more effective when given before viral inoculation (p<0.0001) which may be due to its inhibition of viral attachment on (p<0.0001) and penetration (p<0.0001) into the host cells. The anti-HRSV activity of Radix Glycyrrhizae was further confirmed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. 300Î¼g/ml Radix Glycyrrhizae markedly decreased the viral amounts within the cells and in the suspension. Radix Glycyrrhizae might further stimulate mucosal cells to secrete IFN-Î² to counteract viral infection. CONCLUSIONS: Both Radix Glycyrrhizae and Radix Glycyrrhizae Preparata are effective against HRSV infection on airway epithelial cells. Radix Glycyrrhizae inhibited HRSV mainly by preventing viral attachment, internalization, and by stimulating IFN secretion. 18Î²-GA may be one of its active constituents.
23063069	Parental exposure to natural mixtures of POPs reduced embryo production and altered gene transcription in zebrafish embryos. Determination of toxicity of complex mixtures has been proposed to be one of the most important challenges for modern toxicology. In this study we performed genome wide transcriptome profiling to assess potential toxicant induced changes in gene regulation in zebrafish embryos following parental exposure to two natural mixtures of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The mixtures used were extracted from burbot (Lota lota) liver originating from two lakes (Lake MjÃ¸sa and Lake Losna) belonging to the same freshwater system in Norway. The dominating groups of contaminants were polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane metabolites (DDTs). Because both mixtures used in the present study induced similar effects, it is likely that the same toxicants are involved. The MjÃ¸sa mixture contains high levels of PBDEs while this group of pollutants is low in the Losna mixture. However, both mixtures contain substantial concentrations of PCB and DDT suggesting these contaminants as the predominant contributors to the toxicity observed. The observed effects included phenotypic traits, like embryo production and survival, and gene transcription changes corresponding with disease and biological functions such as cancer, reproductive system disease, cardiovascular disease, lipid and protein metabolism, small molecule biochemistry and cell cycle. The changes in gene transcription included genes regulated by HNF4A, insulin, LH, FSH and NF-ÎºB which are known to be central regulators of endocrine signaling, metabolism, metabolic homeostasis, immune functions, cancer development and reproduction. The results suggest that relative low concentrations of the natural mixtures of POPs used in the present study might pose a threat to wild freshwater fish living in the lakes from which the POPs mixtures originated.
11511858	Complexities of CHEMICALNOTIN action. CHEMICALNOTIN mediate a wide range of processes during embryogenesis and in the adult. In mammals, the principal CHEMICALNOTIN are CHEMICALNOTIN and its 5alpha-reduced metabolite, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Although these androgenic hormones are diverse in character, it is believed that their effects are mediated via the protein products of a single GENENOTIN gene encoded on the X-chromosome. A great deal of information has now accumulated pertaining to the mechanisms by which GENEIN, such as the CHEMICALIN receptor, modulate the activity of responsive genes. The studies have demonstrated the participation of a number of ancillary proteins in modulating activation or repression by GENENOTIN. In addition to studies focused on the mechanisms of GENEIN function, additional work has illuminated the mechanism by which CHEMICALIN are metabolized in selected tissues. This information provides a perspective on the number of levels of complexity by which differential gene regulation by CHEMICALNOTIN may occur in different tissues and in different cell types.
23207409	Combining QSAR classification models for predictive modeling of human monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Due to their role in the metabolism of monoamine neurotransmitters, MAO-A and MAO-B present a significant pharmacological interest. For instance the inhibitors of human MAO-B are considered useful tools for the treatment of Parkinson Disease. Therefore, the rational design and synthesis of new MAOs inhibitors is considered of great importance for the development of new and more effective treatments of Parkinson Disease. In this work, Quantitative Structure Activity Relationships (QSAR) has been developed to predict the human MAO inhibitory activity and selectivity. The first step was the selection of a suitable dataset of heterocyclic compounds that include chromones, coumarins, chalcones, thiazolylhydrazones, etc. These compounds were previously synthesized in one of our laboratories, or elsewhere, and their activities measured by the same assays and for the same laboratory staff. Applying linear discriminant analysis to data derived from a variety of molecular representations and feature selection algorithms, reliable QSAR models were built which could be used to predict for test compounds the inhibitory activity and selectivity toward human MAO. This work also showed how several QSAR models can be combined to make better predictions. The final models exhibit significant statistics, interpretability, as well as displaying predictive power on an external validation set made up of chromone derivatives with unknown activity (that are being reported here for first time) synthesized by our group, and coumarins recently reported in the literature.
16434489	CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) inhibits GENEINGENEIN, an CHEMICALIN-resistant activating mutation that triggers neoplastic growth in most patients with systemic mastocytosis. Mastocytosis is associated with an activating mutation in the GENENOTIN oncoprotein (GENENOTINGENENOTIN) that results in autophosphorylation of the GENENOTIN receptor in a ligand-independent manner. This mutation is inherently resistant to CHEMICALIN and, to date, there remains no effective curative therapy for systemic mastocytosis associated with GENEINGENEIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a novel orally bioavailable GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor that has activity against multiple CHEMICALIN-resistant GENEIN-GENEIN isoforms in vitro that is presently showing considerable promise in early-phase clinical trials of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that high nanomolar concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN can be achieved safely in humans. In this study, we demonstrate significant inhibitory activity of CHEMICALIN against both wild-type GENEIN and the GENEINGENEIN mutation in the nanomolar range in in vitro and cell-based GENENOTIN assays. Additionally, CHEMICALIN leads to growth inhibition of a GENEINGENEIN-harboring human masto-cytosis cell line. Significantly, CHEMICALNOTIN selectively kills primary neoplastic bone marrow mast cells from patients with systemic mastocytosis while sparing other hematopoietic cells. Computer modeling suggests that the GENEINGENENOTIN mutation destabilizes the inactive conformation of the GENEIN to which CHEMICALIN binds, but it is not predicted to impair binding of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. Based upon our results, further evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of systemic masto-cytosis in clinical trials is warranted. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN may be of clinical utility in other disease settings driven by activating GENENOTIN mutations.
23411259	A water-alcohol extract of Citrus grandis whole fruits has beneficial metabolic effects in the obese Zucker rats fed with high fat/high cholesterol diet. Epidemiological studies suggest that citrus fruits and compounds such as flavonoids, limonoids and pectins have health promoting effects. Our aim was to study the effects of Citrus grandis (L.) Osbeck var. tomentosa hort. fruit extract on the energy metabolism. A whole fruit powder from dry water and alcohol extracts of C. grandis containing 19% naringin flavonoid was prepared. The effects of the citrus extract were followed in the obese Zucker rats fed with the HFD. The circulatory levels of GLP-1 decreased significantly by the extract in comparison to the HFD group, whereas the decreased ghrelin levels were reversed. The levels of PYY were decreased in all HFD groups. The leptin amounts decreased but not significantly whereas insulin and amylin were unchanged. The cholesterol and glucose levels were somewhat but not systematically improved in the HFD fed rats. Further studies are needed to identify the active compounds and their mechanisms.
12110374	GENENOTIN-induced GENEIN-mediated production of CHEMICALIN in GENENOTIN-transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells without simultaneous administration of a CHEMICALNOTIN-mobilizing agent. We have earlier demonstrated that dopamine stimulates the liberation of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) precursor, CHEMICALNOTIN, in Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the GENENOTIN, also without concomitant administration of a CHEMICALNOTIN-releasing agent [Nilsson et al., Br J Pharmacol 1998;124:1651-8]. In the present report, we show that CHEMICALNOTIN, under the same conditions, also induces a concentration-dependent increase in the production of CHEMICALNOTIN, with a maximal effect of 235% at approximately 100 microM, and with an EC(50) of 794 nM. The effect was counteracted by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, GENENOTIN, the inhibitor of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN release TMB-8, incubation in CHEMICALNOTIN-free experimental medium, and GENENOTIN desensitization obtained by chronic pretreatment with the phorbol ester TPA. It was also antagonized by the non-specific GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, and by the selective GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, but not by the specific GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. Both the non-specific GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, and an inhibitor of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, AACOF3, counteracted the effect; in contrast, a selective GENENOTIN inhibitor, BEL, and a selective GENENOTIN inhibitor, TAPC, were ineffective. No effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were obtained in control cells mock-transfected with the p3C vector only. The results reinforce previous assumptions that CHEMICALIN may interact with CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism by means of GENEIN activation, and implicate an involvement of GENEIN and GENEIN in this effect. It is suggested that measurement of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced PGE(2) production may serve as a convenient way to study GENENOTIN function in vitro.
23551063	A high throughput assay for the glucuronidation of CHEMICALIN by recombinant GENEIN and liver microsomes. Abstract 1.â GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are versatile and important conjugation enzymes in the metabolism of drugs and other xenobiotics. 2.â We have developed a convenient quantitative multi-well plate assay to measure the glucuronidation rate of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) for several GENEIN. 3.â We have used this method to screen 11 recombinant GENEIN for CHEMICALIN glucuronidation activity and studied the reaction kinetics with the most active enzymes. We have also examined the CHEMICALNOTIN glucuronidation activity of liver microsomes from human, pig, rabbit and rat. 4.â At a substrate concentration of 20âÂµM, the most active CHEMICALIN glucuronidation catalysts were GENEIN followed by GENEIN >GENEIN >GENEIN, whereas at 300âÂµM GENEIN was about 10 times better catalyst than the other recombinant GENEIN. The activities of GENENOTIN were low, whereas GENEIN and GENEIN exhibited no CHEMICALIN glucuronidation activity. GENEIN exhibited a significantly higher Vmax and Km values toward both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN than the other GENEIN. 5.â Human, pig and rabbit, but not rat liver microsomes, catalyzed CHEMICALNOTIN glucuronidation at high rates. 6.â This new method is particularly suitable for fast activity screenings of GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN glucuronidation activity determination from various samples.
23474889	Influence of the novel GENENOTIN antagonist ST1283 on voluntary CHEMICALNOTIN consumption and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced place preference in mice. RATIONALE: Growing evidence supports a role for the central histaminergic system to have a modulatory influence on drug addiction in general and CHEMICALNOTIN-use disorders in particular through GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). OBJECTIVE: In the present study, the effects of systemic injection of the newly synthesized GENENOTIN antagonist ST1283 on CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) voluntary intake and CHEMICALNOTIN-conditioned reward in mice have been investigated. METHODS: Oral CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN intake was assessed in a two-bottle choice paradigm using escalating concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN or tastant solutions. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced place preference (CPP), CHEMICALNOTIN-induced locomotor activity, and blood CHEMICALNOTIN concentration (BEC) were also measured. RESULTS: Following administration of the GENENOTIN antagonist (2.5, 5, and 10Â mg/kg, i.p.), there was a significant dose-dependent decrease in CHEMICALNOTIN consumption and preference. Importantly, vehicle- and ST1283 (5Â mg/kg)-treated mice showed similar consumption and preference to increasing concentration of both sweet and bitter tastes. More interestingly, systemic administration of ST1283 inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-CPP and CHEMICALNOTIN-enhanced locomotion. This inhibition was blocked when mice were pretreated with the selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (10Â mg/kg). Finally, vehicle- and ST1283-treated mice had similar BECs. CONCLUSION: Our results show that ST1283 may decrease voluntary CHEMICALNOTIN consumption and CHEMICALNOTIN-CPP by altering its reinforcing effects, suggesting a novel role for CHEMICALNOTIN signaling in regulation of alcoholism. Lastly, the results add to the growing literature on GENEIN modulation in the pharmacotherapy of CHEMICALIN addiction.
14501155	The CHEMICALNOTIN antidepressant CHEMICALNOTIN increases plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels of mice. Effects of the CHEMICALNOTIN antidepressant CHEMICALNOTIN on plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels in mice were studied. CHEMICALNOTIN at doses ranging 5 - 20 mg/kg elicited significant hyperglycemia in mice. Hyperglycemia elicited by CHEMICALNOTIN was not reduced by pretreatment with the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) depleter CHEMICALNOTIN. The GENENOTIN antagonist methysergide and the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hyperglycemia, while the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN and the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN did not affect it. The GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN facilitated hyperglycemia induced by CHEMICALNOTIN, although the GENEIN-receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN was without effect. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hyperglycemia was reduced by prior adrenalectomy. These results suggest that CHEMICALIN induces hyperglycemia in mice by blocking the GENEINand/or GENEIN receptors, which results in facilitation of CHEMICALNOTIN release.
23307557	GENENOTIN-mediated acetylation of GENENOTIN is required for maintaining functional telomeres. The GENENOTIN is required to protect chromosome ends by facilitating their organization into the protective capping structure. Post-translational modifications of GENENOTIN such as phosphorylation, ubiquitination, SUMOylation, methylation and poly(CHEMICALNOTIN-ribosyl)ation have been shown to play important roles in telomere function. Here we show that GENENOTIN specifically interacts with the GENENOTIN, and that GENENOTIN acetylates the CHEMICALIN residue at position 293 of GENEIN. We also report that GENENOTIN-mediated acetylation stabilizes the GENENOTIN protein by inhibiting its GENENOTIN-dependent proteolysis and is required for efficient telomere binding of GENENOTIN. Furthermore, overexpression of the acetylation-deficient mutant, GENENOTIN, induces DNA-damage response foci at telomeres, thereby leading to induction of impaired cell growth, cellular senescence and altered cell cycle distribution. A small but significant number of metaphase chromosomes show no telomeric signals at chromatid ends, suggesting an aberrant telomere structure. These findings demonstrate that acetylation of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN plays a crucial role in the maintenance of functional telomeres as well as in the regulation of the telomere-associated DNA-damage response, thus providing a new route for modulating telomere protection function.
14984733	Externalization of CHEMICALNOTIN during apoptosis does not specifically require either isoform of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is made in mammalian cells by two GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN. In the plasma membrane CHEMICALNOTIN is normally localized on the inner leaflet but undergoes transbilayer movement during apoptosis and becomes exposed on the cell surface. We induced apoptosis with CHEMICALNOTIN in four Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines that are deficient in GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN to determine if CHEMICALNOTIN generated by either of these enzymes is required for externalization on the cell surface during apoptosis. The onset of apoptosis was confirmed by the appearance of morphological changes and DNA fragmentation while the plasma membrane remained largely intact. In all cell lines, regardless of their content of GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN, apoptosis occurred to approximately the same extent, and within approximately the same time frame, as in parental CHO-K1 cells. The exposure of CHEMICALNOTIN on the cell surface was assessed by annexin V labeling and flow cytometry. Cells that were deficient in either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, as well as cells that were deficient in both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, externalized normal amounts of CHEMICALNOTIN. Our study demonstrates, that reduction of in vitro CHEMICALNOTIN-exchange activity, even by 97%, does not restrict the externalization of CHEMICALNOTIN during apoptosis. Moreover, a normal level of expression of GENEIN and/or GENEIN is not required for generating the pool of CHEMICALIN externalized during apoptosis.
15126366	Characterization of the interaction of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is one of the active ingredients in Euphorbia peplus, which has been used in traditional medicine. Here, we report the initial characterization of CHEMICALIN as a GENEIN (GENEIN) ligand. CHEMICALIN bound to GENEIN in the presence of CHEMICALIN with high affinity; however, under these assay conditions, little GENEIN isoform selectivity was observed. GENEIN isoforms did show different sensitivity and selectivity for down-regulation by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) in WEHI-231, HOP-92, and Colo-205 cells. In all of the three cell types, CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited cell proliferation with somewhat lower potency than did CHEMICALNOTIN. In intact CHO-K1 cells, CHEMICALIN was able to translocate different GENENOTIN-tagged GENEIN isoforms, visualized by confocal microscopy, with equal or higher potency than CHEMICALIN. GENEIN in particular showed a different pattern of translocation in response to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN induced a higher level of secretion of the inflammatory GENEIN GENEIN compared with CHEMICALIN in the WEHI-231 cells and displayed a marked biphasic dose-response curve for the induction. CHEMICALIN was unable to cause the same extent of association of the GENEIN of GENEIN with lipids, compared with CHEMICALIN or the physiological regulator CHEMICALIN, and was able to partially block the association induced by these agents, measured by surface plasmon resonance. The in vitro kinase activity of GENEIN induced by CHEMICALIN was lower than that induced by CHEMICALIN. The novel pattern of behavior of CHEMICALNOTIN makes it of great interest for further evaluation.
23629516	In ovo effects of two CHEMICALNOTIN flame retardants, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, on pipping success, development, mRNA expression and thyroid hormone levels in chicken embryos. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) are organic flame retardants detected in the environment and biota for which toxicological data for avian species are limited. In this study, domestic chicken eggs were injected with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (maximum dose = 51600 and 45000 ng/g egg, respectively) to determine dose-dependent effects on pipping success, development, hepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) expression levels of genes associated with xenobiotic metabolism and the thyroid hormone (TH) pathway, and TH levels following 20-22 days of incubation. Neither compound reduced pipping success; however, CHEMICALNOTIN significantly delayed pipping at 9240 and 51600 ng/g and reduced tarsus length at 51600 ng/g. CHEMICALNOTIN exposure resulted in significant decreases in head plus bill length, embryo mass and gallbladder size at 45000 ng/g and reduced plasma free T4 levels at 7640 ng/g. GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN mRNA levels were significantly induced by CHEMICALIN, while CHEMICALIN induced GENEIN and GENEIN. Chemical analysis of egg contents at incubation days 0, 5, 11, 18, and 19 revealed that >92% of the injected CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN concentration was detectable up to day 5; however, <1% was detected by day 19. The observed phenotypic responses to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN exposure may be associated with disruption of the TH-axis, which is critical for normal growth and development in birds. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the gallbladder indicate that the disturbance of lipid metabolism is a likely target in its mechanism of toxicity.
23188819	Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE): a novel heat shock-like protein. Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) is a highly conserved zinc metallopeptidase that is ubiquitously distributed in human tissues, and particularly abundant in the brain, liver, and muscles. IDE activity has been historically associated with insulin and Î²-amyloid catabolism. However, over the last decade, several experimental findings have established that IDE is also involved in a wide variety of physiopathological processes, including ubiquitin clearance and Varicella Zoster Virus infection. In this study, we demonstrate that normal and malignant cells exposed to different stresses markedly up-regulate IDE in a heat shock protein (HSP)-like fashion. Additionally, we focused our attention on tumor cells and report that (i) IDE is overexpressed in vivo in tumors of the central nervous system (CNS); (ii) IDE-silencing inhibits neuroblastoma (SHSY5Y) cell proliferation and triggers cell death; (iii) IDE inhibition is accompanied by a decrease of the poly-ubiquitinated protein content and co-immunoprecipitates with proteasome and ubiquitin in SHSY5Y cells. In this work, we propose a novel role for IDE as a heat shock protein with implications in cell growth regulation and cancer progression, thus opening up an intriguing hypothesis of IDE as an anticancer target.
23418674	Development of a cell-based high-throughput GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) screening model and its application for evaluation of the extracts from Rhizoma Coptis. To date, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are becoming the new therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In this study, a cell-based high-throughput GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) model was developed for the screening of GENENOTIN agonists. The screening conditions were evaluated through analyzing the expression value of luciferase. Finally, 24Â h of drug acting time, 5 times of the dilution factor of luciferase zymolyte, and about 2Â ÃÂ 10(4) cells/ well on HeLa cells in 96-well plates were used, respectively. Furthermore, the quality of high-throughput screening (HTS) in stability and reliability was evaluated by the Z'-factor. Additionally, different extracts of Rhizoma Coptis and CHEMICALNOTIN were tested by the developed method. The results suggested that both the CHEMICALIN extract and CHEMICALIN were able to activate GENEIN, and Rhizoma Coptis contains potential natural agonists of GENEIN besides CHEMICALIN. In conclusion, the developed HTS assay is a simple, rapid, stable, and specific method for the screening of GENENOTIN natural agonists.
23347684	Synthesis of 2-aminomethyl-4-phenyl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes via LiAlHâ-induced reductive cyclization of 2-(4-chloro-2-cyano-2-phenylbutyl)aziridines and evaluation of their antimalarial activity. 2-(4-Chloro-2-cyano-2-phenylbutyl)aziridines were employed for the one-step stereoselective construction of both endo- and exo-2-aminomethyl-4-phenyl-1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes as new azaheterobicyclic scaffolds via a double LiAlH(4)-induced reductive cyclization protocol. Antiplasmodial assessment of these 1-azabicyclo[2.2.1]heptanes revealed moderate to good activities in the micromolar range, with the exo-isomers being the most promising structures. Furthermore, the proposed mode of action was supported by ligand docking studies, pointing to a strong binding interaction with the enzyme plasmepsin II.
10583449	Pretreatment renal vascular tone predicts the effect of specific GENENOTIN inhibition on natriuresis in essential hypertension. BACKGROUND: In essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular resistance (RVR) may be a marker of GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN system-mediated impairment of renal CHEMICALNOTIN excretion. This hypothesis was tested by investigating whether, in subjects with essential hypertension, the natriuretic response to specific GENEIN-GENEIN-CHEMICALNOTIN system (RAAS) blockade by GENEIN-inhibitor CHEMICALIN could be predicted from pretreatment renal vascular tone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal hemodynamics, and the effects of single (n = 17) and multiple doses (n = 8, 8 days) of CHEMICALNOTIN (600 mg day-1) on CHEMICALNOTIN excretion were studied under conditions of carefully controlled CHEMICALNOTIN balance. RESULTS: Pretreatment renal vascular tone showed considerable individual differences: filtration fraction (FF) ranged from 21.2 to 30.3% and RVR from 18.8 to 33.5 10-2 mmHg min mL-1 in the single dose study, and FF from 20.8 to 24.9% and RVR from 14.8 to 28.8 10-2 mmHg min mL-1 in the multiple dose study. CHEMICALNOTIN induced a fall in blood pressure, FF and RVR, with considerable interindividual variability in natriuretic response. During single dose, cumulative CHEMICALNOTIN loss was 5.1 mmol per 5 h (-8.8 to +24.6), whereas after 8 days treatment cumulative CHEMICALNOTIN loss was 72 +/- 30 mmol (-46 to +187). The natriuretic response to CHEMICALNOTIN during single as well as multiple dose significantly correlated with pretreatment renal vascular tone (estimated from FF and RVR) but not with CHEMICALNOTIN-induced changes in renal hemodynamics or in hormonal parameters. Cumulative CHEMICALNOTIN loss was largest in patients with a higher pretreatment FF and RVR (r = 0.74, P < 0.001 and r = 0.52, P < 0.05, respectively, single dose; and r = 0.75, P < 0.05 and r = 0.73, P < 0.05, respectively, multiple dose). CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis that in essential hypertension an elevated renal vascular tone is a marker of RAAS-mediated impairment of CHEMICALNOTIN excretion.
9003761	Cloning, functional expression and brain localization of a novel unconventional GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN, which has been cloned recently, is a new structural type of weak GENENOTIN. Here we report the structural and functional properties of GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN. Despite a low CHEMICALIN identity between GENEIN and GENEIN (approximately 28%), both channel proteins share the same overall structural arrangement consisting of two GENENOTIN and four transmembrane segments (TMS). This structural similarity does not give rise to a functional analogy. CHEMICALNOTIN currents generated by GENENOTIN are inwardly rectifying while CHEMICALNOTIN currents generated by GENENOTIN are outwardly rectifying. These channels have a conductance of 14 pS. GENEIN currents are insensitive to pharmacological agents that block GENEIN activity such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Extensive inhibitions of GENENOTIN activity are observed after activation of GENENOTIN. GENEIN currents are sensitive to extracellular CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN mRNA is expressed in most tissues and is particularly abundant in the lung and in the brain. Its localization in this latter tissue has been studied by in situ hybridization. GENENOTIN expression is high in the olfactory bulb, hippocampus and cerebellum. These results provide the first evidence for the existence of a GENENOTIN family with four TMS and two GENENOTIN in the nervous system of mammals. They also show that different members in this structural family can have totally different functional properties.
17059881	GENEIN occupancy by CHEMICALIN: implications for the timing and magnitude of clinical response. The objective of the study is to investigate whether GENEIN occupancy by CHEMICALIN and plasma levels over time can account for therapeutic efficacy and the latency period to response. Thirty-eight examinations with CHEMICALNOTIN single photon emission computed tomography were performed on 22 patients with schizophrenia, at diagnosis, 48 h after starting CHEMICALNOTIN treatment and at a stable dose. CHEMICALNOTIN plasma levels were determined and psychopathologic evaluations (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) were carried out. No differences in the striatal/occipital (S/O) ratio or plasma levels were found between examinations at the 48-h time point and when a stable dose level had been established, so these parameters could not account for the latency period required for clinical response. GENENOTIN occupancy at 48 h correlated positively with clinical improvement after 2 weeks of treatment. Therefore, if these results are confirmed, GENEIN occupancy at the beginning of treatment with CHEMICALIN may be a predictor of subsequent clinical response.
14757703	Overexpression of GENEIN in adult rat ventricular myocytes enhances CHEMICALIN cardiostimulation: implications for 'putative' GENEIN pharmacology. 1. CHEMICALIN mediates cardiostimulation by activation of the 'putative' GENEIN; however, it has recently been reported that disruption of the GENEIN gene abolishes this effect. We have adenovirally overexpressed GENEIN in isolated, cultured adult rat ventricular cardiomyocytes and observed the inotropic potency of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (in the presence of 1 microm CHEMICALIN). 2. CHEMICALNOTIN was a full inotropic agonist at rat ventricular myocytes (pD(2) 7.69+/-0.12). CHEMICALNOTIN was a nonconventional partial agonist (pD(2) 6.34+/-0.09), increasing inotropy and lusitropy, with an intrinsic activity of 0.34 and antagonised by CHEMICALNOTIN. 3. GENEIN overexpression enhanced the inotropic potency of CHEMICALIN by 11.7-fold (pD(2) 8.76+/-0.14) and CGP 12177A by 5.9-fold (7.11+/-0.10), respectively. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) overexpression did not alter the potency of CHEMICALNOTIN or CGP 12177A (pD(2) 7.41+/-0.24 and pD(2) 6.60+/-0.50, respectively). 4. The cardiostimulant effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were enhanced by IBMX (GENENOTIN inhibitor) and decreased by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist). CHEMICALNOTIN also increased CHEMICALNOTIN levels. CHEMICALIN but not CHEMICALIN initiated arrhythmias at lower concentrations following GENEIN overexpression. 5. CHEMICALIN saturation binding in Adv.beta(1) myocytes demonstrated approximately 18-fold increase in GENEIN. CHEMICALIN saturation binding, in the presence of CHEMICALIN, increased approximately 5-fold following overexpression of GENEIN. 6. This study demonstrates enhanced cardiostimulation by CHEMICALIN (in the presence of CHEMICALIN) in rat ventricular myocytes overexpressing GENEIN, mediated by a GENEIN/CHEMICALIN signalling pathway. 'Putative' GENENOTIN pharmacology appears to be mediated by activation of a novel affinity state of the GENENOTINr.
11287128	Antithrombin binding of low molecular weight heparins and inhibition of GENENOTIN. Fluorescence and stopped flow methods were used to compare clinically used heparins with regard to their ability to bind to GENENOTIN and to accelerate the inactivation of GENENOTIN. Titration of GENENOTIN with both low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) (enoxaparin, fragmin and ardeparin) and unfractionated heparin (UFH) produced an equivalent fluorescence increase and indicates similar affinity of all heparin preparations to GENENOTIN. However, relative to UFH enoxaparin, the LMWH with the smallest average molecular mass, contained only 12% material with high affinity for GENENOTIN. The rate of GENENOTIN inhibition by GENENOTIN increased with the concentration of the examined heparins to the same limiting value, but the concentration required for maximal acceleration depended on the preparation. According to these data the high affinity fraction of the heparin preparations increased the intrinsic fluorescence and inhibitory activity equally without additional effects by variations in chain length and chemical composition. In contrast, in the presence of CHEMICALIN UFH accelerated the inhibition of GENEIN by GENEIN 10-fold more efficiently than comparable concentrations of the high affinity fractions of enoxaparin and fragmin. The bell-shaped dependence of this accelerating effect suggests simultaneous binding of both proteins to heparin. In conclusion, under physiologic conditions the anti-GENENOTIN activity of heparin results from a composite effect of chain length and the content of material with high affinity to GENENOTIN. Thus, the reduced antithrombotic activity of LMWH relative to UFH results from a smaller content of high affinity material and the absence of a stimulating effect of CHEMICALNOTIN.
15673388	Further insights into the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in short QT syndrome caused by a mutation in GENENOTIN. INTRODUCTION: The principal aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of CHEMICALIN in suppressing GENEIN in vitro and in modulating the rate dependence of the QT interval in the "SQT1" form of the short QT syndrome. METHODS AND RESULTS: Graded-intensity bicycle exercise testing was performed off drug in three patients and during oral CHEMICALNOTIN in two patients with short QT syndrome and compared to a control group of healthy normal subjects. The in vitro effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on currents in patch clamp technique were investigated. Off drugs QTpV3/heart rate correlation is much weaker in patients with short QT syndrome, and QTpV3 shortens less with heart rate increase compared to normal subjects. In addition to prolonging the QT interval into the normal range, CHEMICALNOTIN restored the heart rate dependence of the QT interval toward a range of adaptation reported for normal subjects. Data from heterologous expression of wild-type and mutant GENEIN genes indicate the mutation causes a 20-fold increase in IC50 of d-sotalol but only a 5.8-fold increase in IC50 of CHEMICALIN. CONCLUSION: Oral CHEMICALIN is effective in suppressing the gain of function in GENEIN responsible for some cases of short QT syndrome with a mutation in GENEIN and thus restoring normal rate dependence of the QT interval and rendering ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation noninducible.
23386780	Apoptotic cell death in rat epididymis following epichlorohydrin treatment. Epichlorohydrin (ECH) is an antifertility agent that acts both as an epididymal toxicant and an agent capable of directly affecting sperm motility. This study identified the time course of apoptotic cell death in rat epididymides after ECH treatment. Rats were administrated with a single oral dose of ECH (50Â mg/kg). ECH-induced apoptotic changes were evaluated by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay and its related mechanism was confirmed by Western blot analysis and colorimetric assay. The TUNEL assay showed that the number of apoptotic cells increased at 8Â h, reached a maximum level at 12Â h, and then decreased progressively. The Western blot analysis demonstrated no significant changes in proapoptotic Bcl-2-associated X (Bax) and anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 expression during the time course of the study. However, phospho-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p-p38 MAPK) and phospho-c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (p-JNK) expression increased at 8-24Â h. Caspase-3 and caspase-8 activities also increased at 8-48Â h and 12-48Â h, respectively, in the same manner as p-p38 MAPK and p-JNK expression. These results indicate that ECH induced apoptotic changes in rat epididymides and that the apoptotic cell death may be related more to the MAPK pathway than to the mitochondrial pathway.
15070163	Effects of an ethanolic salix extract on the release of selected inflammatory mediators in vitro. Salix extracts are in current use for the treatment of pain and inflammation. In order to obtain an insight into the mechanism(s) of action of the ethanolic Salix extract 1520L--which is essentially similar to an extract for which clinical studies have demonstrated analgesic effectiveness--its effects were evaluated in an established in vitro assay test system using primary human monocytes. The IC50-values obtained for the inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced release of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) reflecting GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN release were 47 microg/ml and 0.6 microg/ml, for the Salix extract 1520L and CHEMICALNOTIN-like research compound CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. There was no effect on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activity. The Salix extract inhibited the LPS-induced release of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN with IC50-values of 180.0, 33.0 and 86.0 microg/ml, respectively. Both, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, had no effect in any of the parameters. Our results indicate that Salix extract 1520L inhibits GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN release through compounds other than CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Our data further suggest that the proprietary Salix extract is a weak inhibitor of proinflammatory GENENOTIN.
11299519	Mutations in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN genes in mice and humans. GENEIN (GENEIN), a dimeric glycoprotein synthesized in the anterior pituitary gland, is important for the production of sex CHEMICALIN and gametes. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) knockout mice display impaired ovarian follicular development and infertility in females and small testes, oligospermia, and fertility in males. Humans with GENEIN gene mutations tend to have a more severe phenotype than those with GENENOTIN gene mutations, although infertility and varying degrees of impaired sex CHEMICALIN production occur in both types of mutations. Data from human and mouse mutations in the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes suggest that GENENOTIN is necessary for normal pubertal development and fertility in males and females.
17333137	Antipsychotic profile of CHEMICALNOTIN: efficacy in rats and reduced sensitivity in mice deficient in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) enzyme. RATIONALE: Recent studies provide evidence for reduced GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a genetic susceptibility factor as well as suggesting an association of several single CHEMICALNOTIN polymorphisms (SNPs) in GENENOTIN that are associated with an increased incidence of schizophrenia. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to assess the activity of CHEMICALIN, a nonsubtype-selective GENEIN inhibitor, in several animal models predictive of antipsychotic-like efficacy and side-effect liability and to use GENENOTIN wild-type and knockout mice to begin to understand the subtypes involved in the activity of CHEMICALNOTIN. RESULTS: In rats, CHEMICALNOTIN antagonized both CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hyperactivity and inhibited conditioned avoidance responding (CAR). In GENENOTIN wild-type mice, CHEMICALNOTIN dose-dependently suppressed CAR (ED(50) = 2.4 mg/kg); however, in knockout mice, their sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN at the higher doses (1.0 and 3.2 mg/kg) was reduced, resulting in a threefold shift in the ED(50) (7.3 mg/kg), suggesting GENEIN is involved, at least in part, with the activity of CHEMICALIN. Only the highest dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (3.2 mg/kg) produced a modest but significant degree of catalepsy. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALNOTIN has a pharmacologic profile similar to that of the atypical antipsychotics and has low extrapyramidal symptom liability. These results suggest that GENEIN mediates the antipsychotic effects of CHEMICALIN in CAR and that the GENEIN-regulated CHEMICALIN signaling pathway may play a role in the pathophysiology and pharmacotherapy of psychosis.
15963006	Improving the tolerability of anticholinergic agents in the treatment of overactive bladder. Pharmacological treatment for overactive bladder has centred around the interruption of the detrusor activity that is central to urge and incontinence symptoms. The majority of patients with this disorder are treated with antimuscarinic agents. These drugs have been demonstrated to improve urgency, frequency of micturition and urge incontinence, all of which are primary symptoms of overactive bladder; however, they are also commonly associated with anticholinergic adverse effects, most notably dry mouth. Attempts to increase tolerability have included the development of advanced formulations that regulate release of the active ingredient and the development of pharmacological agents that target the desired bladder receptors more specifically and accurately. Although all agents provide good efficacy, tolerability is greatly affected by the formulation used to deliver the active pharmacological agent, as well as the specificity of the targeted receptors. Clinical trials involving a transdermal formulation of oxybutynin have shown that this delivery method may be associated with a lower incidence of anticholinergic adverse events compared with both the immediate-release and the extended-release oral formulations of traditional agents, as well as the most recently approved agents - trospium chloride, solifenacin and darifenacin. Much is still being learned about the function and specificity of muscarinic receptors, which will support the development of agents with sustained efficacy and enhanced tolerability compared with the available formulations to date. These include the S-isomer of oxybutynin, as well as selective muscarinic M2 receptor antagonists.
16441928	Intradialytic parenteral nutrition: comparison of olive oil versus soybean oil-based lipid emulsions. Lipid, oxidative and inflammatory parameters are frequently altered in dialysis patients and may be worsened by intravenous lipid emulsions (ILE). We assessed the efficacy and tolerance of olive as compared with standard soybean oil-based ILE during intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN). IDPN mixtures containing amino acids, glucose, and either olive oil (OO group, n 17) or soybean oil-based ILE (SO group, n 18) were administered in a 5-week randomized, double-blind study. On days 0 and 35, patients' nutritional status was assessed by BMI, normalized protein catabolic rate, predialytic creatinine, serum albumin and transthyretin; lipid metabolism by plasma LDL- and HDL-cholesterol, triacylglycerols, phospholipids, apo A-I, A-II, B, C-II, C-III, E and lipoprotein (a); oxidative status by alpha-tocopherol, retinol, selenium, glutathione peroxidase, malondialdehyde and advanced oxidized protein products; inflammatory status by serum C-reactive protein, orosomucoid, IL-2 and IL-6. No serious adverse event was observed. Significant changes were observed from day 0 to day 35 (P<0.05): nutritional criteria improved (albumin in OO; albumin, transthyretin and creatinine in SO); LDL-cholesterol, apo B, C-II, C-III and apo A-I/A-II ratio increased in both groups. HDL-cholesterol decreased in OO; apo E increased and lipoprotein (a) decreased in SO; alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol ratio increased in OO; malondialdehyde decreased in both groups; IL-2 increased in both groups. The between-group comparison only showed the following differences: alpha-tocopherol/cholesterol increased in OO; lipoprotein (a) decreased in SO. From these data, it was concluded that OO- and SO-based IDPNs similarly improved nutritional status and influenced plasma lipid, oxidative, inflammatory and immune parameters.
14523001	Transcriptional control of the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, by physiological stress. Cells respond to physiological stress by phosphorylating the alpha subunit of the translation initiation factor GENENOTIN. This adaptive response inhibits protein synthesis and up-regulates genes essential for cell survival. GENEIN, the transporter for the essential CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, is one of the up-regulated genes. We previously showed that stress increases GENENOTIN expression by coordinated stabilization of the mRNA and increased mRNA translation. This induction is triggered by CHEMICALNOTIN depletion and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which is caused by unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum. We show here that GENENOTIN gene transcription is also increased by cellular stress. Our studies demonstrate that the GENENOTIN/regulatory region is GENENOTIN-less and is located in a region that includes 94 bases of the first exon. Transcription from this promoter is stimulated 8-fold by cellular stress. An CHEMICALNOTIN response element within the first exon is shown to be required for the response to CHEMICALNOTIN depletion but not to the UPR. The stimulation of transcription by CHEMICALNOTIN depletion requires activation of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, which phosphorylates GENENOTIN. This phosphorylation also induces translation of the GENENOTIN mRNA, demonstrating that stress-induced transcriptional and translational control of GENENOTIN are downstream targets of a signaling pathway initiating with GENENOTIN phosphorylation. Our studies show that the increase in GENENOTIN gene expression by cellular stress involves at least three types of coordinate regulation: regulation of transcription, regulation of mRNA stability, and regulation of mRNA translation.
16597615	Physiological oxygenation status is required for fully differentiated phenotype in kidney cortex proximal tubules. Hypoxia has been suspected to trigger transdifferentiation of renal tubular cells into myofibroblasts in an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. To determine the functional networks potentially altered by hypoxia, rat renal tubule suspensions were incubated under three conditions of oxygenation ranging from normoxia (lactate uptake) to severe hypoxia (lactate production). Transcriptome changes after 4 h were analyzed on a high scale by restriction fragment differential display. Among 1,533 transcripts found, 42% were maximally expressed under severe hypoxia and 8% under mild hypoxia (Po(2) = 48 mmHg), suggesting two different levels of oxygen sensing. Normoxia was required for full expression of the proximal tubule-specific transcripts 25-hydroxyvitamin D 1-hydroxylase (Cyp27b1) and l-pyruvate kinase (Pklr), transcripts involved in tissue cohesion such as fibronectin (Fn1) and N-cadherin (Cdh2), and non-muscle-type myosin transcripts. Mild hypoxia increased myogenin transcript level. Conversely, severe hypoxia increased transcripts involved in extracellular matrix remodeling, those of muscle-type myosins, and others involved in creatine phosphate synthesis and lactate transport (Slc16a7). Accordingly, microscopy showed loss of tubule aggregation under hypoxia, without tubular disruption. Hypoxia also increased the levels of kidney-specific transcripts normally restricted to the less oxygenated medullary zone and others specific for the distal part of the nephron. We conclude that extensive oxygen supply to the kidney tubule favors expression of its differentiated functions specifically in the proximal tubule, whose embryonic origin is mesenchymal. The phenotype changes could potentially permit transient adaptation to hypoxia but also favor pathological processes such as tissue invasion.
22902307	A human hemi-cornea model for eye irritation testing: quality control of production, reliability and predictive capacity. We have developed a 3-dimensional human hemi-cornea which comprises an immortalized epithelial cell line and keratocytes embedded in a collagen stroma. In the present study, we have used MTT reduction of the whole tissue to clarify whether the production of this complex 3-D-model is transferable into other laboratories and whether these tissues can be constructed reproducibly. Our results demonstrate the reproducible production of the hemi-cornea model according to standard operation procedures using 15 independent batches of reconstructed hemi-cornea models in two independent laboratories each. Furthermore, the hemi-cornea tissues have been treated with 20 chemicals of different eye-irritating potential under blind conditions to assess the performance and limitations of our test system comparing three different prediction models. The most suitable prediction model revealed an overall in vitro-in vivo concordance of 80% and 70% in the participating laboratories, respectively, and an inter-laboratory concordance of 80%. Sensitivity of the test was 77% and specificity was between 57% and 86% to discriminate classified from non-classified chemicals. We conclude that additional physiologically relevant endpoints in both epithelium and stroma have to be developed for the reliable prediction of all GHS classes of eye irritation in one stand alone test system.
23644411	CHEMICALNOTIN from the bulbs of Easter lily (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) promote dermal fibroblast migration in vitro. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Preparations derived from bulbs of various Lilium species have been used to promote the healing of skin abrasions, sores and burns and to aid in healing wounds in Traditional Chinese and Greco-Roman Medicine. AIM OF THE STUDY: To evaluate fractionated Easter lily bulb extracts and their CHEMICALNOTIN (1-5) for the promotion of dermal fibroblast migration in vitro, as a model for the early events in wound healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An activity-guided screening approach was used by coupling sequential solvent extraction, gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and semi-preparative reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) with an in vitro dermal fibroblast migration assay. Cytotoxicity was evaluated with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). To gain insight into the mode of action of the CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) production, and expression of genes for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and its receptors were evaluated. RESULTS: Fractionated bulb extracts and the two isolated CHEMICALIN (1) and (2) induced CHEMICALNOTIN production and GENEIN mRNA expression in fibroblast cell culture. In a cytotoxicity assay, CHEMICALNOTIN (1) and (3) had IC50 values of 8.2 and 8.7ÂµM, but the natural acetylation of the C-6â³' CHEMICALNOTIN of the terminal CHEMICALNOTIN unit in (2) resulted in a 3-fold decrease in cell cytotoxicity when compared with (1). Results from the dermal fibroblast migration assay revealed that the CHEMICALNOTIN (1) and (2), and the CHEMICALNOTIN (3) promoted fibroblast migration from the range of 23.7Â±5.7 to 37.7Â±5.1%, as compared with the control. CONCLUSION: Collectively, our data demonstrate that the CHEMICALNOTIN present in Easter lily bulbs induce, at least in part, the observed dermal fibroblast migration activity of the bulb extracts. This is the first evidence that CHEMICALNOTIN from L. longiflorum may potentially play a role in the wound healing process and may provide a scientific basis for the historical use of lily bulbs for this purpose.
10988273	Species-specific pharmacological properties of GENENOTIN. On the basis of data obtained in rabbits, the GENEIN ligand CHEMICALIN has been suggested to decrease blood pressure in humans by activating central GENEIN. A prerequisite for this hypothesis was the unproved assumption that rabbit and human GENEIN are equally activated by CHEMICALIN. Because GENENOTIN in the brain and on cardiovascular sympathetic nerve terminals are identical, the latter were used as a model for the former to confirm or disprove this assumption. Human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary arteries were used to determine the potencies of GENENOTIN agonists in inhibiting the electrically (2 Hz) evoked CHEMICALNOTIN release and of antagonists in counteracting the GENEIN-mediated inhibition induced by CHEMICALIN. In the rabbit pulmonary artery, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are potent full agonists, whereas in the human atrial appendages they are antagonists at the GENEIN, sharing this property with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN is ineffective. In addition, a partial nucleotide and CHEMICALIN sequence of the GENEIN (a region known to substantially influence the pharmacological characteristics of the GENENOTIN) revealed marked differences between the rabbit and the human GENENOTIN. The sympathetic nerves of both the human atrial appendages and rabbit pulmonary artery are endowed with GENEIN, at which, however, both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN exhibit different properties (antagonism and agonism, respectively). The antagonistic property of CHEMICALIN at GENEIN indicates that in contrast to the suggestion based on rabbit data, the hypotensive property of the drug in humans is not due to activation of GENEIN but other, presumably GENEIN, are probably involved.
12606421	GENENOTIN gene expression during pubertal development of male rats. Appropriate expression of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in gonadotropes is critical for CHEMICALNOTIN signaling and hence for GENENOTIN secretion and sexual development. In the present work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state GENENOTIN mRNA levels in pituitaries of male rats from Day 5 to Day 55, when sexual maturity is attained. Developmental changes of GENENOTIN subunit (alpha, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) mRNA levels were also assessed. In addition, the role of the endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN on the maturational changes of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunit gene expression was investigated. Messenger RNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from anterior pituitaries. Amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kb) GENENOTIN mRNA increased slowly from Day 5 through the infantile and the juvenile periods, to peak at Day 35 (12-fold increase vs. Day 5). Thereafter, the levels of the GENENOTIN mRNA decline slightly until Day 55 (33% decrease vs. Day 35). Parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the GENENOTIN gene. Alpha subunit mRNA was easily detected at Day 5, and its levels increased progressively through the infantile period (2.5-fold increase) and peaked at Day 25 (3.3-fold increase vs. Day 5) with a smooth nonstatistically significant increment until Day 35; then it decreased by 41.5% at Day 55. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA levels rose slowly until Day 25. A sharp rise occurred thereafter to reach maximum levels at Day 35 (5.8-fold for GENENOTIN and 3.8-fold for GENENOTIN vs. Day 25). Thereafter, the levels of both mRNAs fell until Day 55 (44.1% decrease for GENENOTIN and 37.1% decrease for GENENOTIN vs. Day 35). To ascertain whether developmental activation of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunit gene expression is CHEMICALNOTIN dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN action by treating developing male rats with the specific CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist cetrorelix (1.5 mg/kg body weight/week, s.c.) through the infantile (Days 5-20) and the juvenile periods (Days 20-35). CHEMICALIN completely blocked the rise of levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of the GENEIN mRNA, during both the infantile and the juvenile periods. CHEMICALIN also abolished the developmental rise of the GENEIN subunit mRNAs during the two periods of the study. In contrast, the alpha subunit gene expression was not altered by cetrorelix treatment during any of the two periods. These data demonstrate that sexual maturation of male rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted induction of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunit gene expression. Developmental activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunit genes is CHEMICALNOTIN dependent. The apparent CHEMICALNOTIN-independent regulation of the GENENOTIN subunit mRNA levels may be due to the contribution of thyrotropes and perhaps to the presence of exclusive regulatory signals for this gene.
2568212	Nonsedating GENENOTIN antagonists. The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosages of the nonsedating GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN are reviewed. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are chemically unrelated to GENEIN antagonists such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is structurally related to the antihistamine CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine CHEMICALNOTIN. Like other GENENOTIN antagonists, they competitively block GENENOTIN sites rather than inhibiting CHEMICALNOTIN release. All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN are metabolized extensively in the liver; CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are both 97% protein bound. CHEMICALNOTIN 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In clinical trials, CHEMICALNOTIN 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than CHEMICALNOTIN for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. For treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, CHEMICALNOTIN combined with CHEMICALNOTIN may be preferable to CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN combinations that require more frequent dosing. CHEMICALNOTIN must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. None of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity. Infrequently reported adverse effects include dry mouth, skin reactions, and weight gain. The absence of substantial sedative effects and the less-frequent dosing schedules make these agents good alternatives to the classic antihistamines for treatment of seasonal and chronic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.
23597450	Anti-inflammatory effect of CHEMICALIN via the suppression of GENEIN pathway. CHEMICALNOTIN is an CHEMICALNOTIN, which is found in Prunus yedoensis. To date no report has been published on anti-inflammatory activities of CHEMICALNOTIN. In the present study, the anti-inflammatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 macrophage and LPS-induced septic shock model were investigated. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expressions were determined by western blot and or realtime-PCR (RT-PCR). To elucidate its underlying mechanism, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation and its downstream pathways were investigated by GENENOTIN transcription factor assay, reporter gene expression, and western blot. In vivo anti-inflammatory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were evaluated in LPS-induced endotoxemia. Promoter assay revealed that CHEMICALIN inhibits LPS-induced CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN production through the suppression of GENEIN and GENEIN at the transcriptional level. In addition, CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN-dependent inflammatory responses by modulating GENEIN (GENEIN)-GENEIN (GENEIN)-GENEIN signaling. Consistent with these results, CHEMICALIN significantly reduced serum levels of inflammatory GENEIN and mortality in mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide. These findings offer a potential mechanism for the anti-inflammatory activity of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23274894	GENENOTIN: A Negative Regulator of Basal CHEMICALIN-Stimulated GENEIN Secretion. Elevated fasting blood CHEMICALNOTIN (FBG) is associated with increased risk for the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular-associated mortality. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have linked polymorphisms in GENENOTIN with variations in FBG and body fat, although not GENENOTIN sensitivity or CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance. GENENOTIN encodes an islet-specific, endoplasmic reticulum-resident GENENOTIN. A combination of in situ perfused pancreas, in vitro isolated islet, and in vivo analyses were used to explore the function of GENENOTIN in mice. GENENOTIN deletion had little effect on GENENOTIN sensitivity and CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance, whereas body fat was reduced in female GENENOTIN knockout (KO) mice on both a chow and high-fat diet, observations that are all consistent with human GWAS data. GENENOTIN deletion resulted in a leftward shift in the dose-response curve for CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN secretion (GSIS). As a consequence, under fasting conditions in which plasma GENENOTIN levels were identical, blood CHEMICALNOTIN levels were reduced in GENENOTIN KO mice, again consistent with human GWAS data. GENENOTIN activity was reduced, whereas basal cytoplasmic CHEMICALNOTIN levels were elevated in islets isolated from GENENOTIN KO mice. These data suggest that GENEIN represents a novel, negative regulator of basal GSIS that acts by hydrolyzing CHEMICALIN, thereby reducing glycolytic flux.
23362262	GENENOTIN integrates GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN complexes to arrest GENENOTIN abundance for glomerular mesangial cell hypertrophy. In many renal diseases, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-stimulated canonical GENENOTIN and noncanonical GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) promote increased protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy. The cellular underpinnings involving these signaling molecules to regulate mesangial cell hypertrophy are not fully understood. GENENOTIN has recently been identified as an GENENOTIN interacting protein and functions as an endogenous inhibitor of the GENENOTIN activity for both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Prolonged incubation of mesangial cells with GENENOTIN reduced the levels of GENENOTIN concomitant with an increase in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activity. Sustained GENENOTIN activation was required to inhibit association of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN, whereas rapid activation had no effect. Using the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN we found that GENENOTIN-induced both early and sustained activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was necessary for GENENOTIN suppression. CHEMICALIN-induced reversal of GENEIN suppression by GENENOTIN was associated with a significant inhibition of GENENOTIN-stimulated protein synthesis and hypertrophy. Interestingly, expression of siRNA against GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, which blocks GENENOTIN-specific GENENOTIN signaling, prevented GENENOTIN-induced suppression of GENENOTIN abundance and GENENOTIN activities. Furthermore, overexpression of GENENOTIN decreased GENENOTIN expression similar to GENENOTIN stimulation concomitant with increased GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities. Finally, knockdown of GENENOTIN reversed GENENOTIN-mediated inhibition of protein synthesis and mesangial cell hypertrophy induced by GENENOTIN. These data reveal the requirement of both early and late activation of GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN-induced protein synthesis. Our results support that GENENOTIN-stimulated GENENOTIN acts as a key node to instill a feedback loop between GENENOTIN down-regulation and GENENOTIN activation in driving mesangial cell hypertrophy.
22537794	CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN): a unique CHEMICALNOTIN uptake inhibitor and potential medication for psychostimulant abuse. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALNOTIN has piqued interest as a treatment for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and stimulant dependence. The CHEMICALNOTIN might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated. METHODS: CHEMICALIN and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) uptake and CHEMICALIN binding in GENEIN (GENEIN) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with CHEMICALNOTIN and the atypical CHEMICALNOTIN uptake inhibitor, CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN were also evaluated in microdialysis studies in the mouse nucleus accumbens shell and in a CHEMICALNOTIN discrimination procedure. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN bind to the GENEIN and inhibit CHEMICALIN uptake less potently than CHEMICALIN, with CHEMICALIN having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. CHEMICALIN was significantly less potent in the GENEIN GENEIN mutant compared with wild-type GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALIN was affected less. Studies with the GENEIN GENEIN mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than CHEMICALIN, which was further supported by CHEMICALIN reactivity on the GENEIN GENEIN GENEIN. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both CHEMICALNOTIN produced increases in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than CHEMICALNOTIN and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate CHEMICALNOTIN from saline. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALNOTIN displays an in vitro profile different from CHEMICALNOTIN. Future trials with CHEMICALNOTIN as a substitute therapy with the potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.
23411172	Apple CHEMICALIN suppress antigen presentation of GENEIN by THP-1-derived dendritic cells. Apple CHEMICALNOTIN extract (AP) and CHEMICALNOTIN contained in AP were investigated for their immunomodulatory effects using THP-1-derived human dendritic cells (TDDCs). The expression levels of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (costimulatory molecule) were measured as an indicator of antigen presentation in TDDCs. A significant decrease in GENEIN expression was observed in the AP and fractionated CHEMICALIN-treated cells in the presence of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), but no effect on GENEIN expression was observed. The uptake of GENENOTIN was not inhibited by AP treatment, and the gene expression of membrane-associated GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, was up-regulated by AP treatment. It can therefore be presumed that AP suppresses GENENOTIN expression via the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN pathway. Furthermore, the up-regulation of GENEIN and GENEIN was found in the CHEMICALIN trimers-treated cells in the presence of GENENOTIN. These results suggest that apple CHEMICALNOTIN would be an effective factor for the development of immunomodulatory agents with suppressive effects of antigen presentation.
23454835	CHEMICALNOTIN induces abnormal nuclear morphology and cell cycle arrest in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. The mycotoxin CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a frequent contaminant in fruit and cereal products, is known to induce DNA damage with subsequent cell cycle arrest. Here we elucidated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on stages of cell cycle progression using the RAW 264.7 macrophage model. CHEMICALNOTIN resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G2/M-phase (4N). Most cells exhibited a large G2 nucleus whereas numbers of true mitotic cells were reduced relative to control. Both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels increased, while GENENOTIN remained in the cytoplasm; suggesting arrest in the G2/M transition point. Remarkably, after exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN for 24h, most of the cells exhibited abnormally shaped nuclei, as evidenced by partly divided nuclei, nuclear blebs, polyploidy and micronuclei (MN). CHEMICALIN treatment also induced abnormal GENEIN bridges, suggesting that cytokinesis was interfered within cells undergoing karyokinesis. A minor part of the resultant G1 tetraploid (4N) cells re-entered the S-phase and progressed to 8N cells.
10796631	Long acting beta-agonists versus theophylline for maintenance treatment of asthma. BACKGROUND: Theophylline and long acting beta2-agonists are bronchodilators used for the management of persistent asthma symptoms, especially nocturnal asthma. They represent different classes of drug with differing side-effect profiles. OBJECTIVES: To assess the comparative efficacy, safety and side-effects of long-acting beta-agonists and theophylline in the maintenance treatment of asthma. SEARCH STRATEGY: Randomised, controlled trials (RCTs) were identified using the Cochrane Airways Group register. The register was searched using the following terms: asthma and theophylline and long acting beta-agonist or formoterol or foradile or eformoterol or salmeterol or bambuterol or bitolterol. Titles and abstracts were then screened to identify potentially relevant studies. The bibliography of each RCT was searched for additional RCTs. Authors of identified RCTs were contacted for other relevant published and unpublished studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: All included studies were RCTs involving adults and children with clinical evidence of asthma. These studies must have compared oral sustained release and/or dose adjusted theophylline with an inhaled long-acting beta-agonist. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Potentially relevant trials, identified by screening titles and/or abstracts, were obtained. Two reviewers independently assessed full text versions of these trials to decided whether the trial should be included in the review, and assessed its methodological quality. Where there was disagreement between reviewers, this was resolved by consensus, or reference to a third party. Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. Inter-rater reliability was assessed by simple agreement. Study authors were contacted to clarify randomisation methods, provide missing data, verify the data extracted and identify unpublished studies. Relevant pharmaceutical manufacturers were also contacted. MAIN RESULTS: Six trials met the inclusion criteria. Five used salmeterol and one, biltoterol. They were of varying quality. There was a trend for salmeterol to improve FEV1 more than theophylline in three studies and salmeterol use was associated with more symptom free nights. Bitolterol, used in only one study, was reported to be less effective than theophylline. Subjects taking salmeterol experienced fewer adverse events than those using theophylline (Relative Risk 0.38; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.25, 0.57). Significant reductions were reported for central nervous system adverse events (Relative Risk 0.51; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.30, 0.88) and gastrointestinal adverse events (Relative Risk 0.32; 95%Confidence Intervals 0.17, 0.59). REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Salmeterol may be more effective than theophylline in reducing asthma symptoms including night waking and improving lung function. More adverse events occurred in subjects using theophylline when compared to salmeterol.
1435788	GENENOTIN will process GENENOTIN, a member of the GENENOTIN family of hormones. GENENOTIN is a polypeptide hormone involved in remodeling of the birth canal during parturition. It is synthesized as a preprohormone precursor, which undergoes specific processing to form the mature two-chain CHEMICALNOTIN-linked active species that is secreted by the cell. A major part of this processing requires endoproteolytic cleavage at specific pairs of basic CHEMICALIN residues, an event necessary for the maturation of a variety of important biologically active proteins, such as GENEIN and GENEIN. GENENOTIN was coexpressed in human kidney 293 cells with the candidate GENENOTIN GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, both cloned from the mouse pituitary tumor AtT-20 cell line, or with the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GENENOTIN expressed alone in 293 cells was secreted into the culture medium unprocessed. Transient coexpression with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, but not with GENENOTIN, resulted in the secretion of a low mol wt species with an electrophoretic mobility very similar, if not identical, to that of authentic mature GENENOTIN purified from human placenta. This species was precipitable by monoclonal antibodies specific for GENENOTIN and had a retention time on reverse phase HPLC comparable to that of GENENOTIN. Its analysis by both electrospray and fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry generated mass data that were consistent only with mature GENENOTIN. The basic residues required for GENENOTIN-dependent cleavage of GENENOTIN are defined by site-directed mutagenesis.
19888514	Binding between heparin and the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Heparin possesses antimetastatic effects that were related to various molecular mechanisms beyond anticoagulant activities. The ability of heparin to interfere with the function of GENENOTIN in the metastatic course appears as a promising therapeutic approach. This refers to numerous findings that heparin attenuates metastasis in a selectin-dependent manner. We recently demonstrated that heparin interferes with the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN on murine melanoma cells binding to GENENOTIN. To confirm this activity and to obtain further insight into molecular recognition of heparin by GENENOTIN, we investigated the inhibition of GENENOTIN mediated binding of human melanoma MV3 cells to immobilised GENENOTIN by different heparins. The size of heparin has an important impact on inhibition. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) and CHEMICALNOTIN, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) representing a mean of about 18-20 monomers, displayed high inhibitory activity. Fractionating CHEMICALNOTIN to 14-18 monomers reduced inhibition slightly, while the CHEMICALNOTIN was without effects. To confirm molecular recognition of CHEMICALIN by GENEIN, a surface acoustic wave-biosensor was applied. A GENEIN containing membrane preparation of MV3 cells was immobilised at the sensors to allow for detection of kinetic binding constants of CHEMICALIN compared to GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN binds to GENEIN with affinity in the low micromolar range (4.61 x 10(-6) M), which clearly indicates specific molecular recognition. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN displays a nearly identical k(off) compared to GENENOTIN (5.13 x 10(-3) s(-1) versus 3.44 x 10(-3) s(-1)) which is evident for interference with the ligand binding. The data provide evidence for a direct confirmation of heparin binding to GENENOTIN and thus, contribute to understand the antimetastatic activity of heparin.
15635044	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN determine differential ligand selectivity to GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) show differential ligand preference for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively. Using a variety of chimeric receptors based on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a representative GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, a representative GENENOTIN, this study elucidated specific domains responsible for this ligand selectivity. A chimeric GENENOTIN with the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of GENENOTIN showed a great increase in ligand sensitivity to GENENOTIN but not to GENENOTIN. Point-mutation studies indicate that four CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN(7.38), CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN(7.43), CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN(7.46), and CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN(7.47) in GENEIN are critical for ligand selectivity as well as receptor conformation. Furthermore, a combinatory mutation (CHEMICALIN(7.31)-CHEMICALIN(7.32)-CHEMICALIN(7.33) motif to CHEMICALIN in GENEIN and CHEMICALIN(7.38), CHEMICALIN(7.43), CHEMICALIN(7.46), and CHEMICALIN(7.47) to those of GENEIN) in GENENOTIN exhibited an approximately 500-fold increased sensitivity to GENENOTIN, indicating that these residues are critical for discriminating GENENOTIN from GENENOTIN. [Trp(7)]GENENOTIN and [Trp(8)]GENENOTIN but not [His(5)]GENENOTIN exhibit a higher potency in activating wild-type GENENOTIN than native GENENOTIN, indicating that CHEMICALIN at positions 7 and 8 of GENEIN are more important than position 5 for differential recognition by GENENOTIN. As a whole, these data suggest a molecular coevolution of ligands and their receptors and facilitate the understanding of the molecular interaction between GENENOTIN and their cognate receptors.
10403635	Success of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN treatments in acute CHEMICALNOTIN intoxication. The acute toxicity of CHEMICALIN (OP) compounds in mammals is due to their irreversible inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN) in the nervous system, which leads to increased synaptic CHEMICALIN levels. The protective actions of intravenously (i.v.) administered CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and an GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, in acute CHEMICALNOTIN intoxication were studied in mice. The acute intragastric (i.g.) toxicity (LD50) of CHEMICALNOTIN with and without the pretreatments was tested by the up-and-down method. The mice received CHEMICALNOTIN (0.06 mg/kg body weight), CHEMICALNOTIN (0.09 mg/kg body weight), the CHEMICALNOTIN derivative CHEMICALNOTIN (0.90 mg/kg body weight) or GENENOTIN (104 U/g, 10.7 microg/g body weight) 10 min prior to the i.g. administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was also administered with GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN was the most effective antidote in CHEMICALNOTIN intoxication. The LD50 value for CHEMICALNOTIN increased 3.4-fold in mice receiving GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was the most effective CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. The protective ratios of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were 1.5- and 1.2-1.3-fold, respectively. CHEMICALNOTIN did not give any protection against CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity. Both the GENENOTIN and CHEMICALIN treatments protected the brain GENEIN activities measured 24 h after CHEMICALIN exposure. In GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-treated mice, a 4- and 2-fold higher CHEMICALIN dose, respectively, was needed to cause a 50% inhibition of brain GENEIN activity. Moreover, the combination of GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN increased the LD50 value for CHEMICALNOTIN 4.3-fold. The animals pretreated with GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN tolerated four times the lethal dose in control animals, furthermore their survival time was 2-3 h in comparison to 20 min in controls. In conclusion, GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were the most effective treatments against CHEMICALNOTIN intoxication. However, CHEMICALNOTIN did not provide any protection against CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity.
23238784	Phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism and CHEMICALNOTIN production of HepaRG cells in a bioartificial liver in absence of CHEMICALNOTIN. The human liver cell line HepaRG has been recognized as a promising source for in vitro testing of metabolism and toxicity of compounds. However, currently the hepatic differentiation of these cells relies on exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which, as a side effect, has a cytotoxic effect and represses an all-round hepatic functionality. The AMC-bioartificial liver (AMC-BAL) is a three-dimensional bioreactor that has previously been shown to upregulate various liver functions of cultured cells. We therefore cultured HepaRG cells in the AMC-BAL without CHEMICALNOTIN and characterized the drug metabolism. Within 14 days of culture, the HepaRG-AMC-BALs contained highly polarized viable liver-like tissue with heterogeneous expression of GENENOTIN. We found a substantial metabolism of the tested substrates, ranging from 26% (GENENOTIN), 47% (GENENOTIN), to 240% (GENENOTIN) of primary human hepatocytes. The GENEIN activity could be induced 2-fold by CHEMICALIN, whereas GENEIN activity remained equally high. The HepaRG-AMC-BAL secreted CHEMICALNOTIN at 43% the rate of primary human hepatocytes and demonstrated hydroxylation, conjugation, and transport of CHEMICALNOTIN. Concluding, culturing HepaRG cells in the AMC-BAL yields substantial phase 1 and phase 2 drug metabolism, while maintaining high viability, rendering CHEMICALNOTIN addition superfluous for the promotion of drug metabolism. Therefore, AMC-BAL culturing makes the HepaRG cells more suitable for testing metabolism and toxicity of drugs.
23328072	Dose-dependent effects of vitamin D on transdifferentiation of skeletal muscle cells to adipose cells. Fat infiltration within muscle is one of a number of features of vitamin D deficiency, which leads to a decline in muscle functionality. The origin of this fat is unclear, but one possibility is that it forms from myogenic precursor cells present in the muscle, which transdifferentiate into mature adipocytes. The current study examined the effect of the active form of vitamin Dâ, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin Dâ (1,25(OH)âDâ), on the capacity of the C2C12 muscle cell line to differentiate towards the myogenic and adipogenic lineages. Cells were cultured in myogenic or adipogenic differentiation media containing increasing concentrations (0, 10â»Â¹Â³, 10â»Â¹Â¹, 10â»â¹, 10â»â· or 10â»âµ âM) of 1,25(OH)âDâ for up to 6 days and markers of muscle and fat development measured. Mature myofibres were formed in both adipogenic and myogenic media, but fat droplets were only observed in adipogenic media. Relative to controls, low physiological concentrations (10â»Â¹Â³ and 10â»Â¹Â¹ âM) of 1,25(OH)âD3 increased fat droplet accumulation, whereas high physiological (10â»â¹ âM) and supraphysiological concentrations (â¥10â»â· âM) inhibited fat accumulation. This increased accumulation of fat with low physiological concentrations (10â»Â¹Â³ and 10â»Â¹Â¹ âM) was associated with a sequential up-regulation of PPARÎ³2 (PPARG) and FABP4 mRNA, indicating formation of adipocytes, whereas higher concentrations (â¥10â»â¹ âM) reduced all these effects, and the highest concentration (10â»âµ âM) appeared to have toxic effects. This is the first study to demonstrate dose-dependent effects of 1,25(OH)âDâ on the transdifferentiation of muscle cells into adipose cells. Low physiological concentrations (possibly mimicking a deficient state) induced adipogenesis, whereas higher (physiological and supraphysiological) concentrations attenuated this effect.
23466229	CHEMICALIN as a template for structure-based drug design: identification of new CHEMICALIN series of irreversible GENEIN inhibitors with improved lipophilic efficiency. The structure-based design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of a new CHEMICALIN series of irreversible GENEIN inhibitors are described herein. The modification of the inhibitor scaffold of 1 and 2 from a CHEMICALIN core to a CHEMICALIN core led to discovery of a new series of potent GENEIN inhibitors with excellent physicochemical properties. Compound 20 is the most potent and lipophilically efficient of these new CHEMICALNOTIN analogs, with a k(inact)/K(i) value of 112,000 M(-1)s(-1) and lipophilic efficiency (LipE) of 8.53. The X-ray crystal structure of 20 with GENENOTIN demonstrates key features that contribute to this remarkable potency and binding efficiency.
17378584	A single residue in leucyl-tRNA synthetase affecting amino acid specificity and tRNA aminoacylation. Human mitochondrial leucyl-tRNA synthetase (hs mt LeuRS) achieves high aminoacylation fidelity without a functional editing active site, representing a rare example of a class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) that does not proofread its products. Previous studies demonstrated that the enzyme achieves high selectivity by using a more specific synthetic active site that is not prone to errors under physiological conditions. Interestingly, the synthetic active site of hs mt LeuRS displays a high degree of homology with prokaryotic, lower eukaryotic, and other mitochondrial LeuRSs that are less specific. However, there is one residue that differs between hs mt and Escherichia coli LeuRSs located on a flexible closing loop near the signature KMSKS motif. Here we describe studies indicating that this particular residue (K600 in hs mt LeuRS and L570 in E. coli LeuRS) strongly impacts aminoacylation in two ways: it affects both amino acid discrimination and transfer RNA (tRNA) binding. While this residue may not be in direct contact with the amino acid or tRNA substrate, substitutions of this position in both enzymes lead to altered catalytic efficiency and perturbations to the discrimination of leucine and isoleucine. In addition, tRNA recognition and aminoacylation is affected. These findings indicate that the conformation of the synthetic active site, modulated by this residue, may be coupled to specificity and provide new insights into the origins of selectivity without editing.
23253172	Neurochemical control of rapid stress-induced changes in brain aromatase activity. In the male brain, the medial preoptic nucleus (POM) is known to be a critical relay for the activation of sexual behaviour, with the aromatisation of testosterone into 17Î²-oestradiol (E2 ) playing a key role. Acute stress has been shown to differentially modulate the aromatase enzyme in this and other brain nuclei in a sex-specific manner. In POM specifically, stress induces increases in aromatase activity (AA) that are both rapid and reversible. How the physiological processes initiated during an acute stress response mediate sex- and nuclei- specific changes in AA and which stress response hormones are involved remains to be determined. By examining the relative effects of corticosterone (CORT), arginine vasotocin (AVT, the avian homologue to arginine vasopressin) and corticotrophin-releasing factor (CRF), the present study aimed to define the hormone profile regulating stress-induced increases in AA in the POM. We found that CORT, AVT and CRF all appear to play some role in these changes in the male brain. In addition, these effects occur in a targeted manner, such that modulation of the enzyme by these hormones only occurs in the POM rather than in all aromatase-expressing nuclei. Similarly, in the female brain, the experimental effects were restricted to the POM but only CRF was capable of inducing the stress-like increases in AA. These data further demonstrate the high degree of specificity (nuclei-, sex- and hormone-specific effects) in this system, highlighting the complexity of the stress-aromatase link and suggesting modes through which the nongenomic modulation of this enzyme can result in targeted, rapid changes in local oestrogen concentrations.
11330337	Differential inhibition of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN binding to GENEIN in rat brain membranes with GENENOTIN inhibitors. The potential interaction of GENENOTIN inhibitors with GENENOTIN may play a significant role in the therapeutic and/or side-effects associated with this class of compound. In the present study, the capacity of GENENOTIN inhibitors to interact with GENEIN was assessed by their ability to displace both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN binding in rat brain membranes. The CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of GENENOTIN inhibitors, displaced CHEMICALNOTIN binding with high-to-moderate potency (CHEMICALNOTIN>CHEMICALNOTIN=CHEMICALNOTIN=CHEMICALNOTIN>CHEMICALNOTIN> CHEMICALNOTIN=CHEMICALNOTIN>CHEMICALNOTIN) whereas only CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN displaced CHEMICALNOTIN binding. Inhibitors such as CHEMICALNOTIN, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of GENEIN inhibitors, with the exception of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, to displace bound CHEMICALIN in preference to CHEMICALIN predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at GENEIN. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting GENEIN (CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN=CHEMICALIN =CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN=CHEMICALIN=CHEMICALIN >CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of GENEIN also displaced CHEMICALNOTIN to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace CHEMICALNOTIN-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of CHEMICALNOTIN catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to CHEMICALIN-labelled GENEIN. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of GENENOTIN (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of CHEMICALIN binding, thus permitting an estimation of the "global affinity" of CHEMICALNOTIN (Ki 85 nM) for CHEMICALIN-labelled GENEIN in rat brain.
16494569	Abnormally high plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN in children with autism not taking supplements compared to controls not taking supplements. BACKGROUND: There have been many studies of the effect of high-dose supplementation of CHEMICALNOTIN on children and adults with autism, with all but one reporting benefits. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the biochemical basis for CHEMICALNOTIN therapy by measuring the level of total CHEMICALNOTIN in the plasma of unsupplemented children with autism spectrum disorder compared to unsupplemented control subjects. PARTICIPANTS: Children with autism spectrum disorders (n = 35, age 3-9 years) and unrelated typical children (n = 11, age 6-9 years), all from Arizona, were studied. (This includes the data from 24 children with autism from our previous study.) METHODOLOGY: A microbiologic assay was used to measure the level of total CHEMICALNOTIN (including phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms), in a blinded fashion. RESULTS: Children with autism had a 75% higher level of total CHEMICALNOTIN than the controls (medians of 56 versus 32 ng/mL, respectively, p = 0.00002). Most of the autistic children (77%) had levels that were more than 2 standard deviations above the median value of the controls. The autistic girls (n = 5) also had elevated levels (mean of 54.6 ng/mL, median of 60 ng/mL). DISCUSSION: These results are consistent with previous studies that found that: (1) GENENOTIN had a very low activity in children with autism and (2) CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels are unusually low in children with autism. Thus, it appears that the low conversion of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN results in low levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, which is the active cofactor for 113 known enzymatic reactions, including the formation of many key neurotransmitters. CONCLUSIONS: Total CHEMICALNOTIN is abnormally high in autism, consistent with previous reports of an impaired GENEIN for the conversion of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN. This may explain the many published studies of benefits of high-dose CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation in some children and adults with autism.
23273219	Synthesis, molecular modeling and evaluation of novel CHEMICALIN derivatives as dual inhibitors for GENEIN and GENEIN aggregation. To develop new drugs for treatment of Alzheimer's disease, a group of CHEMICALIN was designed, synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit GENEIN, GENEIN and aggregation of GENENOTIN. The enzyme inhibition assay results indicated that compounds moderately inhibit both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN aggregation results showed that all compounds exhibited remarkable GENEIN fibril aggregation inhibition activity with a nearly similar potential as the reference compound CHEMICALIN, which makes them promising anti-Alzheimer drug candidates. Docking experiments were carried out with the aim to understand the interactions of the most active compounds with the active site of the GENENOTIN enzymes.
20230007	Effect of anabolic-androgenic CHEMICALNOTIN and glucocorticoids on the kinetics of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN nucleocytoplasmic translocation. Although the qualitative nucleocytoplasmic transport of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has been studied, there is little documentation of the cellular kinetics of this transport. Here, translocation studies using the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were performed to aid in identifying the mechanism by which anabolic-androgenic CHEMICALIN (AAS) were activating GENEIN and potentially interacting with GENEIN and how glucocorticoid ligands were interacting with the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The real-time analysis of EGFP-labeled GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN ligand-induced cytoplasm-to-nucleus translocation was performed using fluorescence microscopy to better understand the action of these GENENOTIN in a physiologically relevant cell-based model. After transient transfection, the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN individually translocate as expected (i.e., transport is ligand-induced and dose-dependent) in this model biological system. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) had the fastest translocation rate for the GENEIN of 0.0525 min(-1). The other endogenous CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), had considerably lower GENEIN transport rates. The rates of GENEIN transport for the exogenous CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) are lower than that of CHEMICALIN and similar to those of the endogenous CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. The GENENOTIN transport rates for cortisol (COR) and dexamethasone (DEX) are also presented. The synthetic GC, DEX, had a more rapid translocation rate (0.1599 min(-1)) at the highest dose of 100 nM compared to the endogenous GC COR (0.0431 min(-1)). The data obtained agrees with the existing qualitative data and adds an important ligand-dependent kinetic component to GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transport. These kinetic data can aid our understanding of CHEMICALNOTIN action and interaction with other regulatory proteins, and can be useful in the development of new therapies.
17015640	CHEMICALIN, a balanced inhibitor of GENEIN and GENEIN, reduces inflammation in a rabbit model of atherosclerosis. CHEMICALIN, a dual anti-inflammatory drug that inhibits GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) enzymes, may have a better cardiovascular profile that GENENOTIN inhibitors due to GENEIN blockade-mediated antithrombotic effect and a better gastrointestinal tolerability. We examined the anti-inflammatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on atherosclerotic lesions as well as in isolated neutrophils from whole blood of rabbits compared with a selective inhibitor of GENEIN, CHEMICALIN. We also assessed the antithrombotic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in rabbit platelet-rich plasma. For this purpose, 30 rabbits underwent injury of femoral arteries, and they were randomized to receive 10 mg/kg/day CHEMICALNOTIN or 5 mg/kg/day CHEMICALNOTIN or no treatment during 4 weeks with atherogenic diet in all cases. Ten healthy rabbits were used as controls. Neutrophils and platelets were isolated from peripheral blood of rabbits for ex vivo studies. CHEMICALIN reduced intima/media ratio in injured arteries, the macrophages infiltration in the neointimal area, GENEIN (GENEIN) gene expression, and the activation of GENEIN in rabbit atheroma. Moreover, CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN and GENEIN protein expression in vascular lesions. CHEMICALIN only diminished GENEIN protein expression and GENEIN gene expression in vascular atheroma. CHEMICALNOTIN in rabbit plasma was attenuated by both drugs. CHEMICALIN almost abolished GENEIN activity by inhibiting CHEMICALIN generation in rabbit neutrophils and prevented platelet CHEMICALIN production from whole blood. CHEMICALNOTIN reduces neointimal formation and inflammation in an atherosclerotic rabbit model more markedly than CHEMICALNOTIN. This effect, together with the antiplatelet activity of CHEMICALNOTIN, suggests that this drug may have a favorable cardiovascular profile.
15177307	No influence of moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALIN, an oral GENEIN selective inhibitor. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the novel GENEIN (GENEIN) selective inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), so that dose recommendations for clinical use can be provided. This was an open-label, single dose, case-controlled study in which eight subjects with liver cirrhosis classed as moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-9) and eight demographically-matched healthy subjects received a single oral 400 mg dose of CHEMICALNOTIN. Routine safety assessments were made and blood samples were taken for determination of CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations for 96 h post dose. The ex vivo binding of CHEMICALNOTIN to plasma proteins was determined pre dose and at 2 and 12 h post dose. An analysis of variance was used to detect differences in PK parameters (AUC, Cmax and Tmax) between the treatment groups. There were no significant differences between subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency and healthy subjects in the area under the CHEMICALNOTIN plasma concentration-time curves (AUC(0-infinity)): 29.2 +/- 6.7 microg h ml(-1) versus 28.7 +/- 6.3 mircrog h ml(-1). The rate of absorption of CHEMICALNOTIN was not significantly altered by hepatic impairment based on Cmax and Tmax. The protein-bound fraction of CHEMICALNOTIN exceeded 98% both in healthy control subjects and in those with moderate hepatic insufficiency. A single dose of 400 mg CHEMICALNOTIN was well tolerated. In conclusion, no dose adjustments appear to be required when CHEMICALNOTIN is administered to patients with either mild or moderate hepatic impairment.
23395981	CHEMICALIN modulates expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in murine embryonic fibroblasts. Fetal CHEMICALNOTIN syndrome (FAS), presenting with a constellation of neuro-/psychological, craniofacial and cardiac abnormalities, occurs frequently in offspring of women who consume CHEMICALNOTIN during pregnancy, with a prevalence of 1-3 per 1000 livebirths. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that CHEMICALIN alters global DNA methylation, and modulates expression of the GENEIN (GENEIN) and various CHEMICALNOTIN-binding proteins. Murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), utilized as an in vitro embryonic model system, demonstrated â¼5% reduction in global DNA methylation following exposure to 200mM CHEMICALNOTIN. In addition, CHEMICALIN induced degradation of GENEIN (GENEIN1, GENEIN, and GENEIN), as well as the GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN), in MEF cells by the proteasomal pathway. Such degradation could be completely rescued by pretreatment of MEF cells with the proteasomal inhibitor, CHEMICALNOTIN. These data support a potential epigenetic molecular mechanism underlying the pathogenesis of FAS during mammalian development.
23632905	GENEIN Gene Expression in the Liver of CHEMICALIN-induced and Spontaneous Type 1 Diabetic Rats. Several investigations have shown a relation between diabetes and alterations of the liver circadian GENENOTIN. We investigated the diurnal expression of GENEIN genes and GENEIN (GENEIN) in 3-hour intervals for a 24-h period in the livers of male CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-treated rats, male spontaneous type 1 diabetic LEW.1AR1-iddm (Iddm) rats, and Iddm rats treated for 10 days with GENENOTIN. Hepatic mRNA was extracted, and the relative expression of GENENOTIN genes (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN), as well as GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN), was analyzed by reverse transcription followed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Diabetic CHEMICALIN and Iddm rats, as well as GENENOTIN-substituted Iddm rats, exhibited a significant diurnal expression pattern of GENEIN genes as determined by Cosinor analysis; however, the MESOR (midline estimating statistic of rhythm) of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN transcript expression was altered in Iddm and GENENOTIN-substituted Iddm rats. The hepatic expression of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN revealed a diurnal rhythm in all investigated groups. GENENOTIN administration to Iddm rats normalized the enhanced MESOR in the expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN to the levels of normoglycemic controls. Cosinor analysis indicated no diurnal rhythm of GENEIN expression in the livers of diabetic CHEMICALIN or Iddm rats or in those of GENENOTIN-substituted Iddm rats. Also, GENENOTIN substitution could not reverse the decreased MESOR of GENENOTIN expression in Iddm rats. In consequence of the diabetic disease, changes in the expression of GENENOTIN genes and GENENOTIN suggest alterations in the hepatic peripheral GENENOTIN mechanism.
1705137	Comparison of the GENEIN inhibiting properties of two reversible and selective GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, and assessment of their effect on psychometric performance in healthy subjects. 1. The effects of two reversible, predominantly GENEIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, CHEMICALIN (150 mg three times daily) and CHEMICALIN (400-200-400 mg day-1) on CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites and psychometric performance were compared in a double-blind placebo controlled crossover study in 12 healthy subjects. 2. After 7 days of CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN/placebo administration subjects were hospitalized for 24 h on day 8. Blood samples were drawn every 2 h for determination of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Urine was collected for measurements of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN excretion. Psychometric performance (short- and long-term memory, critical flicker fusion frequency, choice reaction time) and subjective feelings were assessed before each drug intake (in the morning, at noon, in the evening). 3. Compared with placebo, both reversible GENENOTIN inhibitors decreased the plasma concentration of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The overall fall in CHEMICALNOTIN (AUC from 0 to 24 h) was 44% during CHEMICALNOTIN and 12% during CHEMICALNOTIN (P less than 0.001) and the overall decrease in CHEMICALNOTIN was 38% and 20% (P less than 0.005) on CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. 4. Before the next drug intake, GENEIN inhibition, as judged by the decrease of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentration, was significantly different from placebo with CHEMICALIN but not with CHEMICALIN. 5. CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, exerted a moderate, but significant inhibition of the deamination of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) as judged by the fall in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentration. Neither drug influenced plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentration. 6. A significant rise in urinary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN was observed on CHEMICALNOTIN and to a lesser extent on CHEMICALNOTIN. The urinary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly raised by CHEMICALNOTIN but not by CHEMICALNOTIN. 7. Neither CHEMICALNOTIN nor CHEMICALNOTIN altered memory function, vigilance, subjective feelings or sleep characteristics of the subjects.
23453071	Synthesis and evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN derivative as anti-angiogenic agents. Previously, we have found that CHEMICALIN, a CHEMICALIN derivative, inhibits GENEIN (GENEIN)-mediated angiogenesis signaling in human endothelial cells. During our continuous efforts to identify more potent anti-angiogenic agents, we synthesized various CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives and evaluated their anti-angiogenic effects. We found that CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) significantly inhibited human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) proliferation, migration, tube formation, and microvessel growth in a concentration range of 10-100 nM. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN inhibited the GENEIN-induced phosphorylation and intracellular GENEIN activity of GENEIN (GENEIN) and the activation of its downstream GENEIN pathway. Taken together, these findings suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN be considered a potential lead compound for cancer therapy.
10328230	Inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN reduces tumor growth and lung metastases in mice bearing Lewis lung carcinoma. We have examined the effects of the synthetic GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and the GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, on GENEIN activity of murine Lewis-lung-carcinoma cells (3LL) in vitro, and on local growth and lung metastasis of the same tumor implanted intramuscularly in syngeneic C57BL/6 mice. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the survival of the 3LL-tumor-bearing mice was also examined. Here we report that CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in decreased transcription and protein levels of GENEIN by 3LL cells. Both CHEMICALIN and captopril also prevented substrate degradation by GENEIN released in conditioned medium by cultured cells. Treatment of tumor-bearing animals with CHEMICALNOTIN (i.p.) or CHEMICALNOTIN (in drinking water) resulted in significant inhibition of the mean tumor volume (25 and 33% respectively) and of the mean lung metastasis number (26 and 29% respectively). When both agents were given, they acted in synergy, resulting in 51 and 80% inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis. The survival time of the mice treated with both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was also significantly longer compared with the groups treated with each agent alone or with the vehicle. Our data support the hypothesis of an essential role of GENENOTIN in the metastatic process. Moreover, blockade of invasion, angiogenesis and other processes mediated by GENENOTIN may underlie the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and their combination. It is conceivable that this combination could be tested in selected clinical conditions as an adjuvant modality to cytotoxic therapy.
17079868	GENENOTIN polymorphisms are associated with serum GENENOTIN levels in postmenopausal women. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is thought to play an important role in the development of osteoporosis and fracture. GENEIN (GENEIN) is an enzyme involved in the conversion of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN. We hypothesized that certain genetic polymorphisms of GENENOTIN leading to reduced enzyme activity may cause hyperhomocysteinemia and affect bone metabolism. We therefore examined the associations of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN polymorphisms of the GENENOTIN gene with bone mineral density (BMD) and serum GENENOTIN levels in postmenopausal women. Although we did not detect any significant associations between GENENOTIN polymorphisms and BMD or serum GENENOTIN levels, we found that the 66G/524C haplotype, which has reduced enzyme activity, was significantly associated with serum GENENOTIN levels in a gene-dose dependent manner (P = 0.002). That is, the highest GENENOTIN levels (34.5 +/- 16.8 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing two copies, intermediate GENENOTIN levels (32.6 +/- 14.4 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing one copy, and the lowest levels of GENENOTIN (28.8 +/- 10.9 ng/ml) were observed in subjects bearing no copies. These results suggest that the 66G/524C haplotype of the GENENOTIN gene affect bone turn over rate.
17081103	GENENOTIN and redox-regulated transcription factors. Analysis of the selenoproteome identified five GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in mammals: GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) and, in GENENOTIN, which is restricted to the olfactory system. GENEIN reduce hydroperoxides to the corresponding CHEMICALIN by means of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). They have long been considered to only act as antioxidant enzymes. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that nature has not created redundant GENENOTIN just to detoxify hydroperoxides. GENENOTIN clearly acts as an antioxidant, as convincingly demonstrated in GENENOTIN-knockout mice. GENENOTIN specifically interferes with GENENOTIN activation by GENENOTIN, reduces CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis, prevents GENENOTIN expression, and is indispensable for sperm maturation and embryogenesis. GENENOTIN, which is not exclusively expressed in the gastrointestinal system, is upregulated in colon and skin cancers and in certain cultured cancer cells. GENENOTIN is a target for GENENOTIN, and thus is part of the adaptive response by itself, while GENENOTIN might prevent cancer by interfering with inflammatory pathways. In conclusion, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN have distinct roles, particularly in cellular defence mechanisms. Redox sensing and redox regulation of metabolic events have become attractive paradigms to unravel the specific and in part still enigmatic roles of GENENOTIN.
22717743	Efficacy and long-term safety of alipogene tiparvovec (AAV1-LPL(S447X)) gene therapy for lipoprotein lipase deficiency: an open-label trial. We describe the 2-year follow-up of an open-label trial (CT-AMT-011-01) of AAV1-LPL(S447X) gene therapy for lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency (LPLD), an orphan disease associated with chylomicronemia, severe hypertriglyceridemia, metabolic complications and potentially life-threatening pancreatitis. The LPL(S447X) gene variant, in an adeno-associated viral vector of serotype 1 (alipogene tiparvovec), was administered to 14 adult LPLD patients with a prior history of pancreatitis. Primary objectives were to assess the long-term safety of alipogene tiparvovec and achieve a î¶40% reduction in fasting median plasma triglyceride (TG) at 3-12 weeks compared with baseline. Cohorts 1 (n=2) and 2 (n=4) received 3 Ã 10(11)âgcâkg(-1), and cohort 3 (n=8) received 1 Ã 10(12)âgcâkg(-1). Cohorts 2 and 3 also received immunosuppressants from the time of alipogene tiparvovec administration and continued for 12 weeks. Alipogene tiparvovec was well tolerated, without emerging safety concerns for 2 years. Half of the patients demonstrated a î¶40% reduction in fasting TG between 3 and 12 weeks. TG subsequently returned to baseline, although sustained LPL(S447X) expression and long-term changes in TG-rich lipoprotein characteristics were noted independently of the effect on fasting plasma TG.
23152189	CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated production of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species is an essential step in the mechanism of action to accelerate human keratinocyte differentiation. Chloracne is commonly observed in humans exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN); yet, the mechanism of toxicity is not well understood. Using normal human epidermal keratinocytes, we investigated the mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated enhancement of epidermal differentiation by integrating functional genomic, metabolomic, and biochemical analyses. CHEMICALNOTIN increased the expression of 40% of the genes of the epidermal differentiation complex found on chromosome 1q21 and 75% of the genes required for de novo CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis. Lipid analysis demonstrated that eight of the nine classes of CHEMICALNOTIN were increased by CHEMICALNOTIN, altering the ratio of CHEMICALNOTIN to free CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN decreased the expression of the GENEIN, GENEIN, and most of the glycolytic transcripts, followed by decreases in glycolytic intermediates, including CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and Krebs cycle intermediates were decreased, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN was increased. Mitochondrial GENEIN activity and the CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN ratio were decreased by CHEMICALIN, ultimately leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, characterized by decreased inner mitochondrial membrane potential and CHEMICALNOTIN production, and increased production of the reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS), CHEMICALNOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) antagonists blocked the response of many transcripts to CHEMICALNOTIN, and the endpoints of decreased CHEMICALNOTIN production and differentiation, suggesting regulation by the GENENOTIN. Cotreatment of cells with chemical antioxidants or the enzyme GENENOTIN blocked the CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated acceleration of keratinocyte cornified envelope formation, an endpoint of terminal differentiation. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated ROS production is a critical step in the mechanism of this chemical to accelerate keratinocyte differentiation.
19427182	GENEIN is involved in hepatic CHEMICALIN secretion. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an essential fat-soluble nutrient with antioxidant properties. GENEIN (GENEIN), the product of the gene responsible for familial isolated CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency, plays an important role in maintaining the plasma CHEMICALIN level by mediating the secretion of CHEMICALIN by the liver. However, the mechanisms underlying hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN secretion are not fully understood. This study was undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN re-efflux from hepatocytes, the cells that have the most important role in regulating plasma-CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations. From in vitro experiments using CHEMICALNOTIN and McARH7777 cells that stably express GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the following results were obtained. First, addition of GENEIN (GENEIN), a direct acceptor of the GENEIN (GENEIN)-secreted lipids, increased CHEMICALIN secretion in a dose-dependent manner. Second, CHEMICALIN, an antiatherogenic compound reported to be an inactivator of GENEIN reduced hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN secretion. Third, GENEIN-RNAi suppressed hepatic CHEMICALIN secretion. In a mouse in vivo experiment, addition of 1% CHEMICALNOTIN to the diet decreased plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations. These results strongly suggest that GENEIN is substantially involved in hepatic CHEMICALIN secretion.
16343532	Crystal structures of GENEIN bound to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN: elucidation of the mechanism of enzyme inhibition by cyanobacterial toxins. The CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are tumour promoting hepatotoxins that are responsible for global adverse human health effects and wildlife fatalities in countries where drinking water supplies contain cyanobacteria. The toxins function by inhibiting broad specificity GENENOTIN in the host cells, thereby disrupting signal transduction pathways. A previous crystal structure of a CHEMICALIN bound to the catalytic subunit of GENEIN (GENEIN) showed distinct changes in the active site region when compared with GENENOTIN structures bound to other toxins. We have elucidated the crystal structures of the GENENOTIN, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN bound to GENEIN. The atomic structures of these complexes reveal the structural basis for inhibition of GENENOTIN by these toxins. Comparisons of the structures of the GENENOTIN:GENENOTIN complexes explain the biochemical mechanism by which CHEMICALIN but not CHEMICALIN permanently modify their GENEIN targets by covalent addition to an active site CHEMICALIN residue.
8302852	A CHEMICALIN-sensitive GENEIN: cloning, expression, and electrophysiological characterization. A CHEMICALIN-sensitive, high-affinity GENEIN cDNA, denoted GENEIN, was isolated and characterized in oocytes. GENEIN shows little transport of other CHEMICALIN and is CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN dependent. Sequence analysis indicates 12 putative transmembrane domains and strong homologies (approximately 50%) among GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Interestingly, the pharmacological properties of GENENOTIN, including sensitivity to antidepressants, are more similar to those of GENENOTIN than to GENENOTIN. Two-electrode voltage-clamp analysis demonstrated CHEMICALNOTIN-induced, voltage-dependent currents. Cloning and characterization of GENENOTIN adds significantly to our knowledge of the diversity of GENENOTIN with regard to primary sequence, pharmacological profile, and permeation properties.
23357567	Formation of mainstream cigarette smoke constituents prioritized by the World Health Organization--yield patterns observed in market surveys, clustering and inverse correlations. The WHO TobReg proposed mandating ceilings on selected smoke constituents determined from the market-specific median of nicotine-normalized yield distributions. Data validating this regulatory concept were obtained from essentially single-blend surveys. This process is strongly impacted by inverse correlations among yields. In the present study, 18 priority WHO smoke constituent yields (nicotine-normalized) were determined (using two smoking regimens) from 262 commercial brands including American, Virginia and local blends from 13 countries. Principal Component Analysis was used to identify yields patterns, clustering of blend types and the inverse correlations causing these clusters. Three principal components explain about 75% of total data variability. PC1 was sensitive to the relative levels of gas- and particle-phase compounds. PC2 and PC3 cluster American- and Virginia-blends, revealing inverse correlations: Nitrogen oxides and amino- or nitroso-aromatic compounds inversely correlate to either formaldehyde and acrolein, or benzo(a)pyrene and di-hydroxybenzenes. These results can be explained by reviewing the processes determining each components smoke delivery. Regulatory initiatives simultaneously targeting selected smoke constituents in markets with mixed blend styles will be strongly impacted by the inverse correlations described. It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of such regulations on public health, considering the complex chemistry of cigarette smoke formation.
9015795	Atypical neuroleptics have low affinity for GENENOTIN or are selective for GENENOTIN. This review examines the possible receptor basis of the atypical action of those atypical antipsychotic drugs that elicit low levels of Parkinsonism. Such an examination requires consistent and accurate dissociation constants for the antipsychotic drugs at the relevant GENENOTIN. It has long been known, however, that the dissociation constant of a given antipsychotic drug at the GENENOTIN varies between laboratories. Although such variation depends on several factors, it has recently been recognized that the radioligand used to measure the competition between the antipsychotic drug and the radioligand is an important variable. The present review summarizes information on this radioligand dependence. In general, a radioligand of low solubility in the membrane (i.e., low tissue:buffer partition) results in a low value for the antipsychotic dissociation constant when the drug competes with the radioligand. Hence, by first obtaining the antipsychotic dissociation constants using different radioligands of different solubility in the membrane, one can then extrapolate the data to low or "zero" ligand solubility. The extrapolated value represents the radioligand-independent dissociation constant of the antipsychotic. These values are here given for GENENOTIN, as well as for GENENOTIN. These values, moreover, agree with the dissociation constant directly obtained with the radioactive antipsychotic itself. For example, CHEMICALIN revealed a radioligand-independent value of 1.6 nM at the GENEIN, agreeing with the value directly measured with CHEMICALIN at GENEIN. However, because CHEMICALIN competes with endogenous CHEMICALIN, the in vivo concentration of CHEMICALIN (to occupy GENEIN) can be derived to be about 13 nM, agreeing with the value of 12 to 20 nM in the plasma water or spinal fluid observed in treated patients. The atypical neuroleptics CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN had low affinity for the CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN (radioligand-independent dissociation constants of 30 to 90 nM). Such low affinity makes these latter five drugs readily displaceable by high levels of endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN in the caudate or putamen. Most typical neuroleptics have radioligand-independent values of 0.3 to 5 nM at GENEIN, making them more resistant to displacement by endogenous CHEMICALIN. Finally, a relation was found between the neuroleptic doses for rat catalepsy and the GENENOTIN:GENENOTIN ratio of the radioligand-independent K values for these two receptors. Thus, the atypical neuroleptics appear to fall into two groups, those that have a low affinity for GENENOTIN and those that are selective for GENENOTIN.
17360707	alpha7 nicotinic receptor gene promoter polymorphisms in inbred mice affect expression in a cell type-specific fashion. Inbred mouse strains display significant differences in their levels of brain alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7 nAChR) expression, as measured by binding of the alpha7-selective antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin. Variations in alpha-bungarotoxin binding have been shown to correlate with an animal's sensitivity to nicotine-induced seizures and sensory gating. In two inbred mouse strains, C3H/2Ibg (C3H) and DBA/2Ibg (DBA/2), the inter-strain binding differences are linked to a restriction length polymorphism in the alpha7 nAChR gene, Chrna7. Despite this finding, the molecular mechanism(s) through which genetic variability in Chrna7 may contribute to alpha7 nAChR expression differences remains unknown. However, studies of the human alpha7 nAChR gene (CHRNA7) previously have demonstrated that CHRNA7 promoter polymorphisms are associated with differences in promoter activity as well as differences in sensory processing. In the present study, a 947-base pair region of the Chrna7 promoter was cloned from both the C3H and DBA/2 inbred mouse strains in an attempt to identify polymorphisms that may underlie alpha7 nAChR differential expression. Sequence analysis of these fragments identified 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A combination of two of these SNPs affects promoter activity in an in vitro luciferase reporter assay. These results suggest a mechanism through which the Chrna7 promoter genotype may influence interstrain variations in alpha7 nAChR expression.
13129570	Synthesis and in vitro pharmacology at CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN preferring GENEIN of CHEMICALIN analogues. CHEMICALIN (1) is a potent GENEIN agonist with moderate affinity for native GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALIN (3) show high affinity for the GENEIN subtype of GENEIN and much lower affinity for the GENEIN subtype of GENEIN. As an attempt to develop new pharmacological tools for studies of GENENOTIN receptors, CHEMICALNOTIN (4a) was designed as a structural hybrid between 1 and 3. 4a was shown to be a potent GENENOTIN agonist and a high affinity ligand and to indiscriminately bind to the GENENOTIN subtypes GENENOTIN with lower affinities. Compounds 4b-h, in which the CHEMICALNOTIN substituent of 4a was replaced by other CHEMICALNOTIN rings, which have previously been incorporated as 5-substituents in CHEMICALNOTIN analogues, as exemplified by 1 were also synthesized. Compounds 4b-h were either inactive (4e,f) or weaker than 4a as affinity ligands for GENEIN and GENEIN with relative potencies comparable with those of the corresponding CHEMICALIN analogues as GENENOTIN agonists. Compounds 4a-h may be useful tools for the progressing pharmacophore mapping of the GENENOTIN agonist binding site.
15650315	CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist, inhibits GENEIN production via a mechanism distinct from GENEIN antagonism. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonist, inhibits not only airway smooth muscle contraction, but also allergic inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibition in allergic inflammation. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or both. The GENENOTIN protein level in the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA was performed using lung tissues. RESULTS: Pretreatment of lung tissues with CHEMICALIN alone significantly decreased the amount of GENEIN protein in the culture medium by 40%. The combination of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN synergistically enhanced this effect. Quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of GENENOTIN mRNA in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues. GENENOTIN mRNA was detected in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less expressed in lymphocytes. CHEMICALIN-induced inhibition of GENEIN mRNA expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their GENEIN mRNA expression status. In addition, CHEMICALIN per se failed to upregulate the GENEIN production. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN synthesis via a mechanism distinct from GENEIN antagonism.
15955565	The GENENOTIN as molecular targets for old and new antiplatelet drugs. Platelet activation by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN plays a crucial role in haemostasis and thrombosis, and their so-called GENENOTIN are potential targets for antithrombotic drugs. The GENENOTIN and the 2 GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN selectively contribute to platelet aggregation. The GENENOTIN receptor is responsible for CHEMICALNOTIN-induced shape change and weak and transient aggregation, while the GENENOTIN receptor is responsible for the completion and amplification of the response to CHEMICALNOTIN and to all platelet agonists, including CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN receptor is involved in platelet shape change and in activation by GENENOTIN under shear conditions. Due to its central role in the formation and stabilization of a thrombus, the GENEIN receptor is a well-established target of antithrombotic drugs like CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN, which have proved efficacy in many clinical trials and experimental models of thrombosis. Competitive GENENOTIN antagonists have also been shown to be effective in experimental thrombosis as well as in several clinical trials. Studies in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN knockout mice and experimental thrombosis models using selective GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN antagonists have shown that, depending on the conditions, these receptors could also be potential targets for new antithrombotic drugs.
15963471	Effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN in human aortic smooth muscle cells. CHEMICALIN are a new class of anti-diabetic agents which increase GENEIN sensitivity by binding to the GENEIN (GENEIN) and stimulating the expression of GENEIN-responsive genes involved in CHEMICALNOTIN and lipid metabolism. These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The present study studied the effects of three CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, on GENENOTIN in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with CHEMICALIN had no effect on GENEIN mRNA and protein levels, CHEMICALIN acutely inhibited CHEMICALIN uptake and CHEMICALIN binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN was GENEIN-independent and kinetic studies revealed that CHEMICALIN was a competitive inhibitor of GENEIN. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN had minimal effects on CHEMICALNOTIN uptake by HASMCs. CHEMICALNOTIN differs from CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in that its side-chain contains a CHEMICALNOTIN moiety. The difference in structure of CHEMICALIN did not account for its inhibitory effect on GENEIN because CHEMICALNOTIN did not inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN uptake by HASMCs. Using the GENENOTIN deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, it was found that CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN but had no effect on GENEIN. From these results, it is suggested that CHEMICALIN may enhance the vasodilatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN by inhibiting GENEIN. Pharmacologically, CHEMICALIN is a novel inhibitor of GENEIN.
15805193	Genetic predictors of the maximum doses patients receive during clinical use of the anti-epileptic drugs CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are effective and inexpensive anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs). As with many AEDs, a broad range of doses is used, with the final "maintenance" dose normally determined by trial and error. Although many genes could influence response to these medicines, there are obvious candidates. Both drugs target the GENENOTIN, encoded by the GENENOTIN family of genes. CHEMICALIN is principally metabolized by GENEIN, and both are probable substrates of the GENEIN GENEIN. We therefore assessed whether variation in these genes associates with the clinical use of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in cohorts of 425 and 281 patients, respectively. We report that a known functional polymorphism in GENEIN is highly associated with the maximum dose of CHEMICALIN (P = 0.0066). We also show that an intronic polymorphism in the GENEIN gene shows significant association with maximum doses in regular usage of both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (P = 0.0051 and P = 0.014, respectively). This polymorphism disrupts the consensus sequence of the 5' splice donor site of a highly conserved alternative exon (5N), and it significantly affects the proportions of the alternative transcripts in individuals with a history of epilepsy. These results provide evidence of a drug target polymorphism associated with the clinical use of AEDs and set the stage for a prospective evaluation of how pharmacogenetic diagnostics can be used to improve dosing decisions in the use of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Although the case made here is compelling, our results cannot be considered definitive or ready for clinical application until they are confirmed by independent replication.
23517912	CHEMICALIN regulates obesity by targeting GENEIN signaling. CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN present in vegetables and fruits, possesses antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. In this study, we have demonstrated that CHEMICALIN prevents diet-induced obesity through regulation of the signaling of GENEIN (GENEIN), a central mediator of cellular growth, cellular proliferation and lipid biosynthesis. To evaluate whether CHEMICALIN regulates GENEIN signaling, we investigated the phosphorylation and GENEIN activity of the GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. CHEMICALIN treatment of preadipocytes reduced the phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. To further our understanding of how CHEMICALIN negatively regulates GENEIN signaling, we analyzed the phosphorylation of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated GENENOTIN-knockdown cells. The results suggested that CHEMICALIN treatment inhibits GENEIN activity in an GENEIN-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that adipocyte differentiation is dependent on GENENOTIN activity. CHEMICALNOTIN treatment inhibited adipocyte differentiation, consistent with the negative effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN. The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on adipogenesis is dependent of GENEIN activity, suggesting that CHEMICALIN inhibits adipogenesis and the accumulation of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN during adipocyte differentiation by targeting GENEIN signaling. CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in body weight and white adipose tissue. We also observed that CHEMICALIN efficiently suppressed the phosphorylation of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in adipose tissue. Collectively, these results suggest that inhibition of GENEIN signaling by CHEMICALIN prevents adipocyte differentiation of 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and obesity in HFD-fed mice. Therefore, CHEMICALNOTIN may be a useful phytochemical agent for attenuating diet-induced obesity.
10047461	GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN activation is associated with cell cycle arrest and inhibition of DNA replication induced by the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a specific antifolate-based GENEIN inhibitor active in a variety of solid tumor malignancies. Studies were carried out in vitro to evaluate downstream molecular alterations induced as a consequence of the potent and sustained inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. Twenty-four hours following the initial 2-h treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN, human A253 head and neck squamous carcinoma cells, not expressing GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN), were accumulated with DNA content characteristic of early S phase of the cell cycle with a concomitant reduction of cells in G1 and G2/M phases. The changes in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein expression and their GENENOTIN activities were examined in control and drug-treated A253 cells. CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in the decrease in GENEIN expression, with an increase in GENEIN and GENEIN protein expression and GENEIN activities 24 h after a 2-h exposure. Although GENENOTIN protein expression was markedly increased, GENENOTIN GENENOTIN activity was only slightly increased. GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN protein expression and GENENOTIN activities remain constant. Lack of activation of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN was associated with a reduced proportion of cells in G2/M phases. Increased GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN protein expression was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis, with a decrease in GENENOTIN expression. These results propose that GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN GENENOTIN can negatively regulate DNA replication. The studies with dThyd rescue from GENEIN-GENEIN protein overexpression and growth inhibition by CHEMICALIN indicate that increased GENEIN-GENEIN protein expression is associated with effective inhibition of GENEIN and resultant dNTP pool imbalance. Provision of dThyd more than 24 h after exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN allowed cells to replicate DNA for a single cycle back to G1, but did not prevent the profound growth-inhibitory effect manifested in the following 5 days. CHEMICALNOTIN treatment resulted in a time-dependent induction of the megabase DNA fragments, followed by secondary 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation. The 50- to 300-kb DNA fragmentation may be derived from the inhibition of DNA synthesis associated with GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN activation. These results suggest that the megabase DNA fragmentation is induced as a consequence of inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN and kilobase DNA fragmentation may correlate with the reduction of GENEIN expression and the increase in GENEIN and GENEIN GENEIN activities. Activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN allows cells to transit from G1 to S phase accompanied by the inhibition of DNA synthesis. The changes in cell cycle regulatory proteins associated with growth inhibition and DNA damage by CHEMICALNOTIN are not GENENOTIN dependent.
23481236	Modulation of cellular GENENOTIN signaling and GENENOTIN effects by lipid metabolites in skeletal muscle cells. Normal CHEMICALNOTIN regulation is achieved by having adequate GENENOTIN secretion and effective CHEMICALNOTIN uptake/disposal. Excess lipids in peripheral tissues - skeletal muscle, liver and adipose tissue - may attenuate GENENOTIN signaling through the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathway and up-regulate GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a negative regulator of GENENOTIN signaling. We studied accumulation of lipid metabolites [CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)] and CHEMICALIN in relation to GENEIN signaling and expression and phosphorylation of GENEIN by preincubating rat skeletal muscle cells (L6 myotubes) with three saturated and three unsaturated free CHEMICALNOTIN (FFAs) (200 Î¼M). Cells were also evaluated in the presence of CHEMICALIN, an inhibitor of GENEIN and thus GENEIN (0-100 nM). Unsaturated FFAs increased CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN expression significantly, but cells remained GENENOTIN sensitive as assessed by robust GENENOTIN and GENEIN phosphorylation at CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) 50, CHEMICALIN 398 and CHEMICALIN 152. Saturated CHEMICALIN increased CHEMICALNOTIN, up-regulated GENEIN, and had GENEIN and GENEIN phosphorylation at CHEMICALIN 50 impaired. We show a significant correlation between phosphorylation levels of GENENOTIN and of GENENOTIN at Ser 50 (R(2)=0.84, P<.05). The same was observed with increasing CHEMICALNOTIN dose (R(2)=0.73, P<.05). Only FFAs that increased CHEMICALIN caused impairment of GENEIN and GENEIN phosphorylation at CHEMICALIN 50. GENENOTIN overexpression in the presence of excess lipids may not directly cause GENENOTIN resistance unless it is accompanied by decreased GENENOTIN phosphorylation. A clear relationship between GENEIN phosphorylation levels at CHEMICALIN 50 and its negative effect on GENENOTIN signaling is shown.
17035524	Functional analyses of glycyl-tRNA synthetase mutations suggest a key role for tRNA-charging enzymes in peripheral axons. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D (CMT2D) and distal spinal muscular atrophy type V (dSMA-V) are axonal neuropathies characterized by a phenotype that is more severe in the upper extremities. We previously implicated mutations in the gene encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase (GARS) as the cause of CMT2D and dSMA-V. GARS is a member of the family of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases responsible for charging tRNA with cognate amino acids; GARS ligates glycine to tRNA(Gly). Here, we present functional analyses of disease-associated GARS mutations and show that there are not any significant mutation-associated changes in GARS expression levels; that the majority of identified GARS mutations modeled in yeast severely impair viability; and that, in most cases, mutant GARS protein mislocalizes in neuronal cells. Indeed, four of the five mutations studied show loss-of-function features in at least one assay, suggesting that tRNA-charging deficits play a role in disease pathogenesis. Finally, we detected endogenous GARS-associated granules in the neurite projections of cultured neurons and in the peripheral nerve axons of normal human tissue. These data are particularly important in light of the recent identification of CMT-associated mutations in another tRNA synthetase gene [YARS (tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase gene)]. Together, these findings suggest that tRNA-charging enzymes play a key role in maintaining peripheral axons.
17661345	GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression in microglia is differentially regulated by GENENOTIN. GENEIN (GENEIN), a CHEMICALIN catabolizing enzyme, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. GENENOTIN expression is induced by GENENOTIN and leads to neurotoxicity by generating CHEMICALNOTIN. Additionally, it inhibits the immune response through both CHEMICALNOTIN depletion and generating other CHEMICALNOTIN catabolites. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN have been shown to control GENENOTIN expression by antagonizing the effects of GENENOTIN in different cell types. Here, we investigated the effects of these GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN expression in microglia. Interestingly, we observed that both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN greatly enhanced GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN expression. However, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which is coinduced with GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN, is downregulated by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The effect of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was independent of GENENOTIN. Modulation of GENENOTIN but not GENENOTIN was eliminated by inhibition of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathway further differentiated the regulation of these two enzymes, as inhibiting the GENENOTIN pathway eliminated GENENOTIN induction of GENENOTIN, whereas such inhibition greatly enhanced GENENOTIN expression. These findings show discordance between modulations of expression of two distinct enzymes utilizing CHEMICALNOTIN as a common substrate, and raise the possibility of their involvement in regulating immune responses in various neurological disorders.
23422569	GENENOTIN inhibits GENENOTIN activation and protects endothelial function in the rat aorta: Implications for vascular aging. Vascular aging is characterized by up-regulation of GENENOTIN, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Previous studies demonstrate that the activity of the evolutionarily conserved GENENOTIN declines with age and that pharmacological activators of GENENOTIN confer significant anti-aging cardiovascular effects. To determine whether dysregulation of GENENOTIN promotes GENEIN-dependent production of reactive CHEMICALIN species (ROS) and impairs endothelial function we assessed the effects of three structurally different inhibitors of GENEIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) in aorta segments isolated from young Wistar rats. Inhibition of GENENOTIN induced endothelial dysfunction, as shown by the significantly reduced relaxation to the endothelium-dependent vasodilators CHEMICALNOTIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN ionophore CHEMICALNOTIN. Endothelial dysfunction induced by GENEIN inhibition was prevented by treatment of the vessels with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN or GENENOTIN. Inhibition of GENEIN significantly increased vascular CHEMICALIN production, enhanced GENEIN activity, and mRNA expression of its subunits GENEIN and GENEIN, which were prevented by CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation mimicked the effects of CHEMICALIN while GENENOTIN inhibition prevented the effects of this GENEIN activator. GENENOTIN co-precipitated with GENENOTIN and CHEMICALIN increased the acetylation of the GENENOTIN coactivator GENEIN, which was suppressed by CHEMICALIN. In conclusion, impaired activity of GENENOTIN induces endothelial dysfunction and up-regulates GENENOTIN-derived ROS production in the vascular wall, mimicking the vascular aging phenotype. Moreover, a new mechanism for controlling endothelial function after GENENOTIN activation involves a decreased GENENOTIN acetylation and the subsequent GENENOTIN activation, resulting in both decreased GENENOTIN-driven ROS production and CHEMICALNOTIN inactivation.
23500776	GENEIN activity induction in peripheral blood lymphocytes, liver and brain tissues of rats orally exposed to CHEMICALIN. Little is known in terms of multi-matrix GENEIN activity induction under repeated oral exposure to planar CHEMICALIN (PHH, CHEMICALIN). In the present study, 60 rats were daily exposed, during 28days, to oral ingestion of a mixture consisting of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN at 0, 6 or 600Î¼g/day. CHEMICALNOTIN activity, reflecting almost exclusively GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities, was measured in brain and liver microsomes as well as in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). All induction kinetics could be appropriately fitted using logistic-like models. After 28days of exposure to a 6Î¼g/day dose, CHEMICALNOTIN activity was found to be 91, 152 and 94-fold increased in lymphocytes, liver and brain, respectively, compared to day 0. Plateau activities could be appropriately fitted versus ingested doses using Hill or Michaelis-Menten models. Correlations between matrices made it possible to conclude that CHEMICALNOTIN activity in PBL should be considered as a sensitive, convenient and non-destructive approach for (i) evaluating CHEMICALNOTIN activity in liver, which was found to represent 98% of the observed CHEMICALNOTIN activities in the three tested matrices and (ii) evaluating oral exposure of homogeneous groups of farm animals (race, diet) to GENEIN inducing PAH and CHEMICALIN.
23322769	Genome-wide screen for modulation of hepatic GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) secretion. Control of plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels is a major therapeutic strategy for management of coronary artery disease (CAD). Although reducing GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (GENENOTIN-c) levels decreases morbidity and mortality, this therapeutic intervention only translates into a 25-40% reduction in cardiovascular events. Epidemiological studies have shown that a high GENENOTINL-c level is not the only risk factor for CAD; low GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (GENENOTIN-c) is an independent risk factor for CAD. GENENOTINI (GENENOTIN) is the major protein component of GENENOTIN-c that mediates reverse CHEMICALNOTIN transport from tissues to the liver for excretion. Therefore, increasing GENENOTIN levels is an attractive strategy for GENENOTIN-c elevation. Using genome-wide siRNA screening, targets that regulate hepatocyte GENENOTIN secretion were identified through transfection of 21,789 siRNAs into hepatocytes whereby cell supernatants were assayed for GENENOTIN. Approximately 800 genes were identified and triaged using a convergence of information, including genetic associations with GENENOTIN-c levels, tissue-specific gene expression, druggability assessments, and pathway analysis. Fifty-nine genes were selected for reconfirmation; 40 genes were confirmed. Here we describe the siRNA screening strategy, assay implementation and validation, data triaging, and example genes of interest. The genes of interest include known and novel genes encoding secreted enzymes, proteases, GENENOTIN, metabolic enzymes, GENENOTIN, and proteins of unknown function. Repression of GENEIN (GENEIN) by siRNA and the enzyme inhibitor CHEMICALIN caused elevation of GENEIN secretion from hepatocytes and from transgenic mice expressing GENEIN and CHEMICALNOTIN transfer protein transgenes. In total, this work underscores the power of functional genetic assessment to identify new therapeutic targets.
17020418	Update on the use of GENENOTIN inhibitors in breast cancer. CHEMICALIN are biosynthesised from CHEMICALIN by the GENEIN enzyme complex called GENEIN. GENENOTIN is expressed in the ovary, placenta, brain, bone, adipose tissue and breast tissue. In breast cancer, intratumoural GENEIN is the source for local CHEMICALIN production in the tissue. Inhibition of GENENOTIN is an important approach for reducing growth stimulatory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent breast cancer. The potent and selective third-generation GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and exemestane were introduced to the market as endocrine therapy in postmenopausal patients failing anti-CHEMICALNOTIN therapy alone, or multiple hormonal therapies. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are both non-CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN inhibitors that compete with the substrate for binding to the enzyme active site. Exemestane is a mechanism-based CHEMICALNOTIN inhibitor that mimics the substrate, is converted by the enzyme to a reactive intermediate, and results in inactivation of GENENOTIN. These third-generation GENENOTIN inhibitors are currently approved as first-line therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with metastatic CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent breast cancer. The use of an GENENOTIN inhibitor as initial therapy, or after treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN, is now recommended as adjuvant hormonal therapy for postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Several clinical studies of GENENOTIN inhibitors focus on the use of these agents in the adjuvant setting, for the treatment of early breast cancer. Recently published results show improved responses with these agents compared with CHEMICALNOTIN.
23511897	High density lipoprotein as a source of cholesterol for adrenal steroidogenesis: a study in individuals with low plasma HDL-C. Few studies have addressed the delivery of lipoprotein-derived cholesterol to the adrenals for steroid production in humans. While there is evidence against a role for low-density lipoprotein (LDL), it is unresolved whether high density lipoprotein (HDL) contributes to adrenal steroidogenesis. To study this, steroid hormone profiles in urine were assessed in male subjects suffering from functional mutations in ATP binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) (n = 24), lecithin:cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) (n = 40), as well as in 11 subjects with low HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) without ABCA1/LCAT mutations. HDL-C levels were 39% lower in the ABCA1, LCAT, and low HDL-C groups compared with controls (all P < 0.001). In all groups with low HDL-C levels, urinary excretion of 17-ketogenic steroids was reduced by 33%, 27%, and 32% compared with controls (all P < 0.04). In seven carriers of either type of mutation, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation did not reveal differences from normolipidemic controls. In conclusion, this study shows that basal but not stimulated corticosteroid metabolism is attenuated in subjects with low HDL-C, irrespective of its molecular origin. These findings lend support to a role for HDL as a cholesterol donor for basal adrenal steroidogenesis in humans.
17035141	Neural tube defects and folate pathway genes: family-based association tests of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. BACKGROUND: Folate metabolism pathway genes have been examined for association with neural tube defects (NTDs) because folic acid supplementation reduces the risk of this debilitating birth defect. Most studies addressed these genes individually, often with different populations providing conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: Our study evaluates several folate pathway genes for association with human NTDs, incorporating an environmental cofactor: maternal folate supplementation. METHODS: In 304 Caucasian American NTD families with myelomeningocele or anencephaly, we examined 28 polymorphisms in 11 genes: folate receptor 1, folate receptor 2, solute carrier family 19 member 1, transcobalamin II, methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase 1, serine hydroxymethyl-transferase 1, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR), 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homo-cysteine methyltransferase, 5-methyltetrahydrofolate-homocysteine methyltransferase reductase, betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), and cystathionine-beta-synthase. RESULTS: Only single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BHMT were significantly associated in the overall data set; this significance was strongest when mothers took folate-containing nutritional supplements before conception. The BHMT SNP rs3733890 was more significant when the data were stratified by preferential transmission of the MTHFR rs1801133 thermolabile T allele from parent to offspring. Other SNPs in folate pathway genes were marginally significant in some analyses when stratified by maternal supplementation, MTHFR, or BHMT allele transmission. CONCLUSIONS: BHMT rs3733890 is significantly associated in our data set, whereas MTHFR rs1801133 is not a major risk factor. Further investigation of folate and methionine cycle genes will require extensive SNP genotyping and/or resequencing to identify novel variants, inclusion of environmental factors, and investigation of gene-gene interactions in large data sets.
23489628	Identification and synthesis of CHEMICALIN derivatives as GENEIN(GENEIN) inhibitors. The GENENOTIN GENENOTIN GENENOTIN mutation, which activates the downstream GENENOTIN signaling pathway, commonly occurs in about 8% of all human malignancies and about 50% of all melanomas. In this study, we employed virtual screening and chemical synthesis to identify a series of CHEMICALIN derivatives as potent GENEIN(GENEIN) inhibitors. Structure-activity relationship studies of these derivatives revealed that compounds b40 and b47 are the two most potent GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) inhibitors in this series.
23383871	Robust array-based coregulator binding assay predicting ERÎ±-agonist potency and generating binding profiles reflecting ligand structure. Testing chemicals for their endocrine-disrupting potential, including interference with estrogen receptor (ER) signaling, is an important aspect of chemical safety testing. Because of the practical drawbacks of animal testing, the development of in vitro alternatives for the uterotrophic assay and other in vivo (anti)estrogenicity tests has high priority. It was previously demonstrated that an in vitro assay that profiles ligand-induced binding of ERÎ± to a microarray of coregulator-derived peptides might be a valuable candidate for a panel of in vitro assays aiming at an ultimate replacement of the uterotrophic assay. In the present study, the reproducibility and robustness of this coregulator binding assay was determined by measuring the binding profiles of 14 model compounds that are recommended by the Office of Prevention, Pesticides and Toxic Substances for testing laboratory proficiency in estrogen receptor transactivation assays. With a median coefficient of variation of 5.0% and excellent correlation (R(2) = 0.993) between duplicate measurements, the reproducibility of the ERÎ±-coregulator binding assay was better than the reproducibility of other commonly used in vitro ER functional assays. In addition, the coregulator binding assay is correctly predicting the estrogenicity for 13 out of 14 compounds tested. When the potency of the ER-agonists to induce ERÎ±-coregulator binding was compared to their ER binding affinity, their ranking was similar, and the correlation between the EC50 values was excellent (R(2) = 0.96), as was the correlation with their potency in a transactivation assay (R(2) = 0.94). Moreover, when the ERÎ±-coregulator binding profiles were hierarchically clustered using Euclidian cluster distance, the structurally related compounds were found to cluster together, whereas the steroid test compounds having an aromatic A-ring were separated from those with a cyclohexene A-ring. We concluded that this assay is capable of distinguishing ERÎ± agonists and antagonists and that it even reflects the structural similarity of ERÎ± agonists, indicating a potential to achieve identification and classification of ERÎ± endocrine disruptors with high fidelity.
23249751	Rapid and specific purification of GENENOTIN-small RNA complexes from crude cell lysates. Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) direct GENENOTIN proteins, the core components of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), to cleave complementary target RNAs. Here, we describe a method to purify active GENENOTIN containing a single, unique small RNA guide sequence. We begin by capturing GENEIN using a complementary CHEMICALIN oligonucleotide tethered to beads. Unlike other methods that capture GENENOTIN but do not allow its recovery, our strategy purifies active, soluble GENENOTIN in good yield. The method takes advantage of the finding that RISC partially paired to a target through its siRNA guide dissociates more than 300 times faster than a fully paired siRNA in GENENOTIN. We use this strategy to purify GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN, as well as GENENOTIN. The method can discriminate among GENENOTIN programmed with different guide strands, making it possible to deplete and recover specific GENENOTIN populations. Endogenous microRNA:GENENOTIN complexes can also be purified from cell lysates. Our method scales readily and takes less than a day to complete.
23578390	CHEMICALIN induces apoptosis in odontoblasts via a GENEIN-dependent mechanism. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is widely used for the treatment of dental caries and dentin hypersensitivity. However, its pro-apoptotic effect on odontoblasts may lead to harmful side-effects. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pro-apoptotic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in odontoblasts and elucidate the possible underlying molecular mechanisms. CHEMICALNOTIN generated cytotoxic effects in odontoblast-lineage cell (OLC) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Exposure of cells to 4mM CHEMICALIN for 24h induced GENEIN activation, ultrastructural alterations, and resulted in the translocation of GENEIN to the mitochondria and the release of GENEIN from the mitochondrial inter-membrane space into the cytosol, indicating that CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated apoptosis is mitochondria-dependent. CHEMICALIN treatment also increased phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN, but not GENEIN, and apoptosis induced by CHEMICALNOTIN was notably or partly suppressed by treatment with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN inhibitors, respectively. Taken together, these findings suggest that CHEMICALIN induces apoptosis in OLC odontoblasts through a GENEIN-dependent mitochondrial pathway.
19780818	The GENENOTIN interacts with GENENOTIN and attenuates its sensitivity to changes in redox potentials. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a member of the second GENENOTIN family identified in vertebrates, appears to preferentially form non-junctional membrane channels. A candidate regulatory protein of GENENOTIN is the GENENOTIN, previously identified by bacterial two-hybrid strategies. Here, we report on the physical association of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN by immunoprecipitation when co-expressed in a neuroblastoma cell line (Neuro2A). Furthermore, in vivo co-expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was shown to occur in murine hippocampus and cerebellum. GENENOTIN is known to accelerate inactivation of otherwise slowly inactivating GENENOTIN under reducing conditions. We subsequently found that GENENOTIN channel currents exhibit a significant reduction when exposed to reducing agents, and that this effect is attenuated in the presence of GENENOTIN. Apparently, GENENOTIN is involved in regulating the susceptibility of GENENOTIN channels to redox potential. Furthermore, the GENEIN channel blockers CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were less effective in inhibiting GENENOTIN currents when GENENOTIN was co-expressed. The influence of GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN is the first example of modulation of GENENOTIN channel function(s) by interacting proteins, and suggests the physiological importance of sensing changes in redox potentials.
23580394	Optoelectronic Processes in Squaraine Dye-Doped OLEDs for Emission in the Near-Infrared. A novel all-organic host-guest system for emission in the NIR is introduced and investigated with respect to its opto-electronic processes. The good agreement between theoretical and experimental results highlights the model character of this system and its potential for electroluminescent application. Comparative measurements provide access to the recombination mechanisms on molecular length scale and show that the emission behavior of the device under operation is controlled by charge carrier dynamics.
23200255	GENENOTIN inhibitors. Part 5: hybrid GENENOTIN inhibitors as dual bronchorelaxant/anti-inflammatory agents for inhaled administration. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) exhibits moderate dual GENEIN-inhibitory activity and promises as a combined bronchodilatory/anti-inflammatory agent. CHEMICALIN-alkylation of the CHEMICALIN ring markedly enhances potency against GENEIN but suppresses GENEIN inhibition. Addition of a CHEMICALIN extension to the CHEMICALIN-alkyl group facilitates both enhancement of GENEIN-inhibitory activity and restoration of potent GENEIN inhibition. Both CHEMICALNOTIN rings, in the core and extension, can be replaced by achiral CHEMICALNOTIN subunits and the core CHEMICALNOTIN by isosteric bicyclic heteroaromatics. In combination, these modifications afford potent dual GENENOTIN inhibitors that suppress CHEMICALNOTIN-induced bronchoconstriction in vivo and exhibit promising anti-inflammatory activity via intratracheal administration.
23344974	Using a fragment-based approach to target protein-protein interactions. The ability to identify inhibitors of protein-protein interactions represents a major challenge in modern drug discovery and in the development of tools for chemical biology. In recent years, fragment-based approaches have emerged as a new methodology in drug discovery; however, few examples of small molecules that are active against chemotherapeutic targets have been published. Herein, we describe the fragment-based approach of targeting the interaction between the tumour suppressor GENENOTIN and the recombination enzyme GENENOTIN; it makes use of a screening pipeline of biophysical techniques that we expect to be more generally applicable to similar targets. Disruption of this interaction in vivo is hypothesised to give rise to cellular hypersensitivity to radiation and genotoxic drugs. We have used protein engineering to create a monomeric form of GENENOTIN by humanising a thermostable archaeal orthologue, GENENOTIN, and used this protein for fragment screening. The initial fragment hits were thoroughly validated biophysically by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and NMR techniques and observed by X-ray crystallography to bind in a shallow surface pocket that is occupied in the native complex by the side chain of a CHEMICALIN from the conserved GENEIN found in GENEIN. This represents the first report of fragments or any small molecule binding at this protein-protein interaction site.
11031122	GENENOTIN is essential for Helicobacter pylori colonization of the mouse stomach. GENEIN (GENEIN) is the key enzyme in CHEMICALIN respiration induced by anaerobic growth of bacteria. In Helicobacter pylori, this enzyme appears to be constitutively expressed under microaerobic conditions and is not essential for its survival in vitro. In this study, the role of GENENOTIN in the colonization of H. pylori was investigated using a mouse model. The GENENOTIN gene coding for GENENOTIN, and two control genes, GENEIN and GENEIN associated with the export of CHEMICALIN out of H. pylori, were inactivated by insertion of the CHEMICALNOTIN acetyltransferase cassette into these individual genes. The isogenic mutants of H. pylori strain AH244 were obtained by natural transformation. Seventy-five ICR mice (15 mice/group) were orogastrically dosed with either the wild type H. pylori strain AH244, its isogenic mutants, or Brucella broth (negative control). Five mice from each group were killed at 2, 4 and 8 weeks post-inoculation (WPI), respectively. H. pylori colonization was not detected in mouse gastric mucosa infected with the GENENOTIN mutant at any time point in the study by both quantitative culture and PCR. In contrast, the mice inoculated with either wild type AH244, GENENOTIN or GENENOTINH. pylori mutants became readily infected. These data indicate that GENENOTIN plays a crucial role in H. pylori survival in the gastric mucosa of mice. Given that GENEIN, present in all H. pylori strains, is immunogenic in H. pylori -infected patients and H. pylori growth in vitro can be inhibited by three anthelmintics (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN), this enzyme could potentially be used both as a novel drug target as well as in the development of vaccines for H. pylori prevention and eradication.
10381000	GENENOTIN mRNA levels are elevated by repeated immobilization stress in rat raphe nuclei but not in pineal gland. Repeated stress triggers a wide range of adaptive changes in the central nervous system including the elevation of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) metabolism and an increased susceptibility to affective disorders. To begin to examine whether these changes are mediated by alterations in gene expression for GENEIN (GENEIN), the rate-limiting enzyme in CHEMICALIN biosynthesis, we quantitated its mRNA levels by competitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Repeated immobilization stress (2 h, 7 days) elicited a six- or ten-fold rise in GENENOTIN mRNA in median raphe nucleus (MRN) and dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN), respectively, without significantly altering GENENOTIN mRNA levels in the pineal gland. In contrast, there was little change in mRNA levels for GENEIN (GENEIN), the rate limiting enzyme in synthesis of the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), the obligate cofactor for GENEIN. This is the first study to reveal stress-elicited activation of GENENOTIN gene expression.
23411246	CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN bioavailability in Caco-2 cells: influence of GENENOTIN. A study has been made of the influence of two pools of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) obtained from GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) fractions, and of three specific GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN(1-25)4P, GENENOTIN(64-74)4P and GENENOTIN(1-19)4P), on CHEMICALNOTIN bioavailability (GENENOTIN synthesis) and CHEMICALNOTIN bioavailability (retention, transport and uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN) in Caco-2 cells. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN pools did not improve GENENOTIN synthesis, but the three specific GENENOTIN showed an increase in GENENOTIN synthesis in Caco-2 cells versus CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN(1-25)4P being the most effective. In relation to CHEMICALNOTIN bioavailability, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN(64-74)4P and GENEIN(1-25)4P increased CHEMICALIN uptake. However, this increase was of the same order as the increase due to the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23535394	An overview on the marine neurotoxin, CHEMICALNOTIN: genetics, molecular targets, methods of detection and ecological functions. Marine neurotoxins are natural products produced by phytoplankton and select species of invertebrates and fish. These compounds interact with GENENOTIN and modulate the flux of these ions into various cell types. This review provides a summary of marine neurotoxins, including their structures, molecular targets and pharmacologies. CHEMICALNOTIN and its derivatives, collectively referred to as paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs), are unique among neurotoxins in that they are found in both marine and freshwater environments by organisms inhabiting two kingdoms of life. Prokaryotic cyanobacteria are responsible for PST production in freshwater systems, while eukaryotic dinoflagellates are the main producers in marine waters. Bioaccumulation by filter-feeding bivalves and fish and subsequent transfer through the food web results in the potentially fatal human illnesses, paralytic shellfish poisoning and CHEMICALNOTIN pufferfish poisoning. These illnesses are a result of CHEMICALIN's ability to bind to the GENEIN, blocking the passage of nerve impulses and leading to death via respiratory paralysis. Recent advances in CHEMICALIN research are discussed, including the molecular biology of toxin synthesis, new protein targets, association with GENEIN and methods of detection. The eco-evolutionary role(s) PSTs may serve for phytoplankton species that produce them are also discussed.
23178380	Pulmonary delivery of an aerosolized recombinant GENENOTIN pretreatment protects against aerosolized CHEMICALNOTIN in macaques. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is the leading pretreatment candidate against exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (OPs), which pose an ever increasing public and military health. Since respiratory failure is the primary cause of death following acute OP poisoning, an inhaled GENENOTIN therapeutic could prove highly efficacious in preventing acute toxicity as well as the associated delayed neuropathy. To address this, studies have been performed in mice and macaques using Chinese Hamster Ovary cells (CHO)-derived recombinant (r) GENENOTIN delivered by the pulmonary route, to examine whether the deposition of both macaque (Ma) and human (Hu) GENENOTIN administered as aerosols (aer) favored the creation and retention of an efficient protective "pulmonary bioshield" that could scavenge incoming (inhaled) OPs in situ thereby preventing entry into the circulation and inhibition of plasma GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN on red blood cells (RBC-GENENOTIN) and in cholinergic synapses. In contrast to parenteral delivery of GENENOTIN, which currently requires posttranslational modification for good plasma stability, an unmodified aer-GENENOTIN pretreatment given 1-40h prior to >1 LD50 of aer-CHEMICALIN (Px) was able to prevent inhibition of circulating GENEIN in a dose-dependent manner. These studies are the first to show protection by GENENOTIN against a pesticide such as CHEMICALNOTIN when delivered directly into the lung and bode well for the use of a non-invasive and consumer friendly method of GENENOTIN delivery as a human treatment to counteract OP toxicity.
23290487	Anti-diabetic property of Tinospora cordifolia and its active compound is mediated through the expression of GENENOTIN in L6 myotubes. Tinospora cordifolia is a well reported plant possessing numerous medicinal values including anti-diabetic property. Aim of the present study is to study the mechanism of action of Tinospora cordifolia and its active compound in differentiated myocytes, L6 cells. Key marker of diabetes in cells is the GENEIN (GENEIN) which also responds to exogenous chemicals, and is over expressed up to 5- and 4-fold, by Tinospora cordifolia and CHEMICALIN, respectively. Next to GENEIN, the predominant protein influencing CHEMICALIN metabolism is GENENOTIN whose expressions were also positively modulated. Further, the inhibitors of GENENOTIN pathway prevented CHEMICALNOTIN uptake mediated by Tinospora cordifolia and CHEMICALIN which shows that the activity is majorly mediated through GENEIN pathway.
2571203	Differential GENENOTIN expression in renal allograft recipients treated with an anti-GENENOTIN antibody. Patients were entered into a randomized trial of prophylaxis for renal allograft rejection by the administration of an anti-GENENOTIN antibody, anti-Tac, during the first ten days posttransplant. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression was measured using two anti-GENENOTIN monoclonal antibodies (moAbs), anti-Tac and 1HT4-4H3. These two antibodies recognize closely spaced epitopes on the 55 kD chain of the GENENOTIN. GENEIN expression was examined on peripheral blood small lymphocytes in three groups of patients who received: CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for baseline immunosuppression (n = 9); (B) anti-Tac with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as baseline immunosuppression (n = 12); and (C) anti-Tac with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as baseline immunosuppression (n = 5). We found that large numbers of T cells express GENENOTIN despite the presence of anti-Tac (average of GENENOTIN-positive cells at day of peak GENENOTIN expression 56.0 +/- 20.8% in group A, 65.2 +/- 26.6% in group B, 21.0 +/- 7.4% in group C). GENENOTIN expression did not correlate with clinical activity, and the presence or accessibility of epitopes on the same 55 kD chain varied dramatically from patient to patient.
9732824	Medical therapy and quality of life. The risk of mortality and long-term morbidity, including loss of sexual function, associated with surgical procedures for symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) has prompted research into alternative medical therapies. Phytotherapy involves the use of herbal formulations, where the mechanisms of action are usually obscure and although studies have confirmed their effectiveness in symptom relief and improving quality of life (QOL), few placebo-controlled trials exist. Both the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN and GENEIN antagonists (e.g. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) have been recommended as appropriate treatment options for patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) associated with benign prostatic obstruction (BPO), and their efficacy has been proven in several placebo-controlled trials. CHEMICALNOTIN reduces the static component of BPO--by reducing the size of the prostate--and, as a result, symptom relief is slow (6-12 months) and is predominantly restricted to patients with large prostates (> 40 g). The GENENOTIN antagonists, on the other hand, reduce the dynamic component of obstruction--relaxation of smooth muscle in the prostate, urethra and bladder neck--and provide rapid symptom relief after only a few doses, relieving LUTS more effectively than CHEMICALNOTIN and irrespective of prostate size. All of the various GENENOTIN antagonists provide effective and comparable relief of LUTS, and an improvement in bothersomeness and symptom-related QOL. However, it is also important that the therapy is fast acting and acceptable to the patient, in that it does not interfere with other medication or produce unpleasant side effects. These documented properties of the GENENOTIN antagonists make them an ideal choice for the medical treatment of symptomatic BPH.
23530595	Bioinspired Water-Enhanced Mechanical Gradient Nanocomposite Films That Mimic the Architecture and Properties of the Squid Beak. Inspired by the water-enhanced mechanical gradient character of the squid beak, we herein report a nanocomposite that mimics both the architecture and properties of this interesting natural material. Similar to the squid beak, we have developed nanocomposites where the degree of cross-linking is controlled along the length of the film. In this study, we utilized tunicate cellulose nanocrystals as the nanofiller that are functionalized with allyl moieties. Using photoinduced thiol-ene chemistry, we have been able to cross-link the CNC nanofiller. In the dry state where strong CNC interactions can occur, only a small mechanical contrast is observed between the cross-linked and uncross-linked samples. However, when the films are exposed to water, which "switches off" the noncovalent CNC interactions, a significant mechanical contrast is observed between the same films. For example, at 20 wt % CNC (in the dry film), an increase in wet modulus from 60 to 300 MPa (â¼500% increase) is observed after photoirradiation. Furthermore, we show that the wet modulus can be controlled by altering the UV exposure time which allows access to mechanical gradient films.
23589476	Wired Enzyme Electrodes-A Retroperspective Story about an Exciting Time at University of Texas at Austin and Its Impact on My Scientific Career. The present paper features an exciting time in the late 1980s when I, as a visiting scientist, had the privilege to participate in the early and very exciting development of the in vivo redox-polymer-wired glucose sensor in Professor Adam Heller's laboratory at the Department of Chemical Engineering at University of Texas at Austin. This story is followed by an overview of the research my visit initiated at Uppsala University. In collaboration with Swedish colleagues, we explored a few of the many possibilities to form new biosensors by utilizing Prof. Heller's concept of cross-linked redox-polymer/redox-enzyme electrodes.
23534412	Antithrombotic activity of a newly synthesized coumarin derivative 3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-N-{2-[3-(5-hydroxy-2,2-dimethyl-chroman-6-yl)-propionylamino]-ethyl}-propionamide. Anti-platelet therapy is a useful strategy to prevent acute thromboembolic artery occlusions. This study was designed to assess the efficacy of seselin derivatives against murine pulmonary thromboembolism, bleeding time, platelet activation and thrombosis. Administration of C3 (16 mg/kg) offered 70% protection against collagen- and epinephrine-induced pulmonary thromboembolism and 30% protection against arachidonic acid-induced death in mice, without adversely affecting bleeding time. No significant difference was observed by C3 in ferric chloride-induced arterial thrombosis in rats. Significant reduction in thrombus weight was observed in arteriovenous shunt model. In rat PRP, C3 reduced ADP and collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In chronic hamster model of dyslipidemia, administration of C3 (16 mg/kg p.o. for 90 days) had no effect on plasma lipids, vasoreactivity and platelet adhesion. C3 fed hamsters showed reduced whole-blood aggregation response to ADP and collagen compared to HC-fed hamsters. In addition, C3 augmented thrombin time; however, time to occlusion was not increased. These results convincingly demonstrated that C3 is a novel molecule that reduces the risk of thrombosis and alleviates prothrombotic state associated with hyperlipidemia without any adverse effect on bleeding time. The high benefit/risk ratio of this compound makes it a suitable candidate for future valid studies.
11972287	Central GENEIN receptor stimulation by CHEMICALIN increases blood CHEMICALNOTIN in rats. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role of central GENENOTIN receptors on the control of blood CHEMICALNOTIN in stressed and non-stressed rats in both fasted and fed states. Adult Wistar male rats had each their third ventricle cannulated 7 days before the experiments. Injections of CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN receptor agonist, induced a significant increase in blood CHEMICALNOTIN in non-stressed rats in both fasted and in fed states. The same procedure was unable to modify stress-induced hyperglycemia. The hyperglycemic effect of CHEMICALIN central administration was blocked by pretreatment with ondansetron, a specific GENEIN receptor antagonist, indicating that the effects here obtained with CHEMICALIN were a result of its interaction with GENEIN receptors. Third ventricle injections of CHEMICALNOTIN alone were not able to modify blood CHEMICALNOTIN in non-stressed animals and did not change the hyperglycemic responses observed after immobilization stress. We conclude that pharmacological activation of the central GENENOTIN receptor induces a hyperglycemic effect in non-stressed animals.
23375813	CHEMICALIN, a potent GENEIN inhibitor from Tabernaemontana divaricata. Guided by the GENEIN inhibiting activity, the CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN was isolated from a stem extract of Tabernaemontana divaricata, a plant used in Thailand in traditional rejuvenation remedies for improving the memory. The structure of the alkaloid was elucidated by extensive use of NMR spectroscopy and the complete assignment of the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN NMR spectra is reported. The alkaloid acted as a non-competitive inhibitor against GENENOTIN with an IC50 value of 7.00Â±1.99Î¼M. An HPLC method was developed for the quantitative analysis of the GENENOTIN inhibitor. It suggested that there was 12.4% (w/w) of CHEMICALNOTIN in the alkaloid enriched fraction of T. divaricata stem.
23434931	GENENOTIN Variation and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is the most severe vision-threatening complication of diabetes. To investigated genetic association between GENENOTIN and PDR in Caucasian type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and its functional consequences, 383 T2DM patients with PDR (T2DM-PDR) and 756 T2DM patients without diabetic retinopathy (T2DM-no DR) were genotyped with rs7903146 in GENENOTIN. We found that risk allele (T) frequency of rs7903146 was significantly higher in T2DM-PDR patients (allelic P = 2.52E-04). In lymphoblastoid cells induced to undergo endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress by treatment of CHEMICALIN, higher fold change of GENEIN and GENEIN mRNA levels were observed in rs7903146-TT cells than that in rs7903146-CC cells (P = 0.02 for GENENOTIN; P = 0.004 for GENENOTIN), suggesting ER stress plays a role in PDR pathogenesis. Silencing GENENOTIN resulted in decreased mRNA levels of both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (P < 0.001). Retinas of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced retinopathy (OIR) mice (a model for PDR) had higher GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA levels than controls (P = 2.9E-04 for GENENOTIN; P = 1.9E-07 for GENENOTIN). Together, our study showed that GENENOTIN-rs7903146 is associated with PDR in Caucasian T2DM and suggested GENENOTIN promoted pathological retinal neovascularization via ER stress-dependent upregulation of GENENOTIN.
22931530	CHEMICALIN: Synthetic Methodologies and Pharmaceutical Applications as GENEIN Inhibitors. CHEMICALNOTIN are interesting scaffolds bearing (at least) two sequential electrophilic CHEMICALNOTIN that by interacting with the nucleophilic moieties of several enzymes, represent the ideal candidates for in vivo and in vitro inhibition studies. In this work a summary of their use as optimal inhibitors of physiologically relevant GENENOTIN is given with a particular emphasis on recently established SAR studies. A brief survey of the most relevant synthetic processes for their obtainment and the importance they possess in synthetic medicinal chemistry is reported.
23600432	GENENOTIN inhibitors: a review of recent patents (2010 - 2012). Introduction: GENEIN (GENEIN) is a crucial enzyme of the CHEMICALIN (AA) cascade and catalyzes the formation of bioactive leukotrienes (LTs) with the help of GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN. LTs are inflammatory mediators playing a pathophysiological role in different diseases like asthma, allergic rhinitis as well as cardiovascular diseases and certain types of cancer. With the rising number of indications for anti-LT therapy, GENENOTIN inhibitor drug development becomes increasingly important. Areas covered: Here, both recent findings regarding the pathophysiological role of GENENOTIN and the patents claimed for GENENOTIN inhibitors are discussed. Focusing on direct inhibitors, several patents disclosing GENENOTIN antagonists are also subject of this review. Novel compounds include CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and several natural product extracts. Expert opinion: Evaluation of the patent activities revealed only quite moderate action. Nevertheless, several auspicious drug-like molecules were disclosed. It seems that in the near future, GENENOTIN inhibitors can be expected to enter the market for the treatment of asthma. With the resolved structure of GENENOTIN, structure-based drug design is now applicable. Together with the identification of downstream enzyme inhibitors and dual-targeting drugs within the AA cascade, several tools are at hand to cope with GENENOTIN increasing pathophysiological roles.
23258671	Super-stable ultrafine beta-tungsten nanocrystals with metastable phase and related magnetism. Ultrafine tungsten nanocrystals (average size of 3 nm) with a metastable phase (beta-tungsten with A15 structure, Î²-W) have been prepared by laser ablation of tungsten in liquid nitrogen. The as-prepared metastable nanocrystals exhibited super-stablity, and can keep the same metastable structure over a period of 6 months at room temperature. This super-stability is attributed to the nanosized confinement effect of ultrafine nanocrystals. The magnetism measurements showed that the Î²-W nanocrystals have weak ferromagnetic properties at 2 K, which may arise from surface defects and unpaired electrons on the surface of the ultrafine nanocrystals. These findings provided useful information for the application of ultrafine Î²-W nanocrystals in microelectronics and spintronics.
23531488	Transport Function and Transcriptional Regulation of a Liver-Enriched GENENOTIN Transcriptional Start Site Variant. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a membrane transporter that facilitates the cellular uptake of a number of endogenous compounds and drugs. GENENOTIN is widely expressed in tissues including the small intestine, liver, kidney, placenta, heart, skeletal muscle and platelets. Recently, it has been shown that differential promoter usage in tissues results in expression of five GENENOTIN transcriptional start site variants which utilize distinct first exons but share common subsequent exons. These variants are expected to encode either a full length (GENEIN) or shortened protein lacking 22 CHEMICALIN-terminus CHEMICALIN (GENEIN). Little is known regarding the transport activity and regulation of GENEIN variants with CHEMICALIN-terminus truncation. Here, using absolute quantitative polymerase chain reaction we find the full length variant is the major form expressed in duodenum but the short variant predominates in liver. Using a transient heterologous cell expression system, we find that the transport activities of the GENEIN variant towards substrates CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are similar to the well-characterized full length variant. Transcriptional activity screening of the liver enriched GENENOTIN identified GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a novel transacting factor. With a combination of in silico screening, promoter mutation in cell-based reporter assays, siRNA knockdown and chromatin immunoprecipitation studies, we identified a functional GENENOTIN binding site close to the transcription start site (-17 to -4 bp). We conclude that the major GENENOTIN protein form in liver is transport competent and its hepatic expression is regulated by GENENOTIN.
23060524	TLR4 antagonist reduces early-stage atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice. Although it has been reported that deficiency of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is associated with reduced atherosclerosis in atherosclerosis-prone mice and attenuated pro-inflammatory state in diabetic mice, it remains undetermined whether treatment with a TLR4 antagonist reduces atherosclerosis in nondiabetic or diabetic mice that have TLR4 expression. In this study, we determined the effect of Rhodobacter sphaeroides lipopolysaccharide (Rs-LPS), an established TLR4 antagonist, on early-stage atherosclerosis in nondiabetic and streptozotocin-induced diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient (Apoe(-/-)) mice. Analysis of atherosclerotic lesions of both en face aortas and cross sections of aortic roots showed that administration of Rs-LPS in 14-week-old diabetic Apoe(-/-) mice for 10 weeks significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions. Although atherosclerotic lesions in nondiabetic Apoe(-/-) mice appeared to be decreased by Rs-LPS treatment, the difference was not statistically significant. Metabolic study showed that Rs-LPS significantly lowered serum levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in nondiabetic mice but not in diabetic mice. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry studies showed that Rs-LPS inhibited the expression of interleukin 6 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 and reduced the content of monocytes and macrophages in atherosclerotic plaques. Taken together, this study demonstrated for the first time that TLR4 antagonist inhibited vascular inflammation and atherogenesis in diabetic Apoe(-/-) mice and lowered serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels in nondiabetic Apoe(-/-) mice.
14530799	The neuropharmacological basis for the use of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. CHEMICALNOTIN has been demonstrated to be safe and effective in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). While the neurobiological basis for the therapeutic activity of CHEMICALIN is not fully understood, the drug is not a GENEIN inhibitor and, therefore, acts differently from current AD therapies. CHEMICALIN can interact with a variety of GENEIN. However, GENEIN appear to be a key target of CHEMICALIN at therapeutic concentrations. CHEMICALIN is an uncompetitive (channel blocking) GENEIN antagonist. Like other GENEIN antagonists, CHEMICALIN at high concentrations can inhibit mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory. However, at lower, clinically relevant concentrations CHEMICALNOTIN can under some circumstances promote synaptic plasticity and preserve or enhance memory in animal models of AD. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN can protect against the excitotoxic destruction of cholinergic neurons. Blockade of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN could theoretically confer disease-modifying activity in AD by inhibiting the "weak" GENEIN-dependent excitotoxicity that has been hypothesized to play a role in the progressive neuronal loss that underlies the evolving dementia. Moreover, recent in vitro studies suggest that CHEMICALIN abrogates GENEIN (GENEIN) toxicity and possibly inhibits GENEIN production. Considerable attention has focused on the investigation of theories to explain the better tolerability of CHEMICALIN over other GENEIN antagonists, particularly those that act by a similar channel blocking mechanism such as dissociative anesthetic-like agents (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN). A variety of channel-level factors could be relevant, including fast channel-blocking kinetics and strong voltage-dependence (allowing rapid relief of block during synaptic activity), as well as reduced trapping (permitting egress from closed channels). These factors may allow CHEMICALNOTIN to block channel activity induced by low, tonic levels of CHEMICALNOTIN--an action that might contribute to symptomatic improvement and could theoretically protect against weak excitotoxicity--while sparing synaptic responses required for normal behavioral functioning, cognition and memory.
23564921	Expansion of the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Î²-Cell Function and GENENOTIN Resistance to Enable Clinical Trial Outcome Modeling Through the Interactive Adjustment of Physiology and Treatment Effects--iHOMA2. OBJECTIVETo describe and make available an interactive, 24-variable homeostasis model assessment (iHOMA2) that extends the HOMA2 model, enabling the modeling of physiology and treatment effects, to present equations of the HOMA2 and iHOMA2 models, and to exemplify iHOMA2 in two widely differing scenarios: changes in GENEIN sensitivity with CHEMICALIN and changes in renal threshold with GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibition.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSiHOMA2 enables a user of the available software to examine and modify the mathematical functions describing the organs and tissues involved in the CHEMICALNOTIN and hormonal compartments. We exemplify this with GENENOTIN inhibition modeling (by changing the renal threshold parameters) using published data of renal effect, showing that the modeled effect is concordant with the effects on fasting CHEMICALNOTIN from independent data.RESULTSiHOMA2 modeling of CHEMICALNOTIN effect suggested that changes in insulin sensitivity in the fasting state are predominantly hepatic. GENENOTIN inhibition modeled by iHOMA2 resulted in a decrease in mean CHEMICALNOTIN of 1.1 mmol/L. Observed data showed a decrease in CHEMICALNOTIN of 0.9 mmol/L. There was no significant difference between the model and the independent data. Manipulation of iHOMA2s renal excretion threshold variable suggested that a decrease of 17% was required to obtain a 0.9 mmol/L decrease in mean CHEMICALNOTIN.CONCLUSIONSiHOMA2 is an extended mathematical model for the assessment of GENENOTIN resistance and Î²-cell function. The model can be used to evaluate therapeutic agents and predict effects on fasting CHEMICALNOTIN and insulin and on Î²-cell function and GENENOTIN sensitivity.
16480505	Roles of CHEMICALIN in drug-drug interactions: underlying molecular mechanisms involving the GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, an important drug in the treatment of tuberculosis, is used extensively despite its broad effects on drug-drug interactions, creating serious problems. The clinical importance of such interactions includes autoinduction leading to suboptimal or failed treatment. The concomitantly administered effects of CHEMICALIN on other drugs can result in their altered metabolism or transportation that are metabolised by GENEIN or transported by GENEIN in the gastrointestinal tract and liver. This review paper summarises recent findings with emphases on the molecular mechanisms used to explain these broad drug-drug interactions. In general, CHEMICALIN can act on a pattern: CHEMICALIN activates the GENEIN that in turn affects GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN activities. This pattern of action may explain many of the CHEMICALNOTIN inducing drug-drug interactions. However, effects through other mechanisms have also been reported and these make any explanation of such drug-drug interactions more complex.
19836445	Screening for (anti)androgenic properties using a standard operation protocol based on the human stably transfected CHEMICALNOTIN sensitive PALM cell line. First steps towards validation. Despite more than a decade of research in the field of endocrine active compounds targeting the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and although suitable cell lines can be obtained, no validated human stably transfected CHEMICALNOTIN sensitive transactivation assay is available. Bayer Schering Pharma (BSP) and the Flemish Institute for Technological Research (VITO), partners within the EU-sponsored 6th framework project ReProTect, made first steps towards such a validation. A standard operation protocol (SOP) developed at BSP based on the CHEMICALNOTIN sensitive PALM cell line was transferred to VITO and its performance and transferability were thoroughly studied. The investigation followed a generic protocol prepared for all reporter gene assays evaluated within ReProTect, and in both laboratories at least three independent experiments were performed. The highest concentration to be tested was limited to 10 microM, if needed. A few compounds, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, were studied using a real world scenario, i.e., assuming that their interaction with the GENEIN was not known: A prescreening for agonism and true, competitive antagonism was used to select conditions such as the appropriate mode of action, and the working range excluding cytotoxicity for the final screening. All other compounds were tested according to the generic protocol: Compounds screened for agonism were the reference CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), while compounds screened for antagonism were the reference CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Cytotoxicity was assessed in parallel as GENENOTIN release. The prescreen classified CHEMICALNOTIN as androgenic, CHEMICALNOTIN and linuron as anti-androgenic and compounds were tested accordingly. In the absence of cytotoxicity, appropriate androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were detected by both laboratories, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN had no androgenic activity. Across the two laboratories EC(50)-values for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN varied by not more than a factor of 3.4, for CHEMICALNOTIN by a factor of 9.7. CHEMICALNOTIN effects could not fully be evaluated, as frequently concentration response curves were incomplete. In the absence of cytotoxicity anti-androgenic properties of reference and test compounds were also detected in both laboratories. CHEMICALNOTIN, the putative negative reference compound, was inactive, CHEMICALNOTIN rather showed agonistic properties. CHEMICALNOTIN was an antagonist at low concentrations, but agonistic properties were observed in one laboratory at high concentrations. Since the highest test concentration was limited to 10 microM, for some compounds no complete concentration response curves were obtained and estimation of EC(50)-values was less robust. Our data demonstrated that the SOP was transferable, and that the assay was able to rank compounds with strong, weak, and without affinity for the GENENOTIN and to discriminate agonists and antagonists. The sensitivity of the assay could be improved further, if the limit of solubility or beginning cytotoxicity was chosen as the highest test concentration. The assay avoids the use of tissues from laboratory animals, and thus contributes to the 3R concept. Furthermore, it could be adjusted to an intermediate/high throughput format. On the whole, this PALM assay is a promising candidate for further validation.
23354070	Evidence for a new binding mode to GENEIN: allosteric regulation by the marine compound CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is widely recognised as a relevant player in the pathogenesis of several highly prevalent disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, mood disorders, diabetes and cancer. Therefore, this enzyme constitutes a highly attractive therapeutic target for the development of selective inhibitors as new promising drugs for the treatment of these pathologies. We describe here the isolation and biochemical characterization of the marine natural CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN as a GENEIN inhibitor. Experimental studies performed for characterizing the inhibitory mechanism indicate that GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN cannot be competed out by CHEMICALIN nor peptide substrate. Molecular modelling techniques have enabled us to propose an unconventional binding mode to GENENOTIN. Moreover, molecular dynamics simulations have identified an allosteric mechanism by which binding of CHEMICALIN leads to GENEIN inhibition. The inhibitory activities determined for a series of structurally related analogues support the proposed binding mode of CHEMICALNOTIN, which is the first compound described to target this allosteric site. The results offer new opportunities for designing and developing selective inhibitors with novel mechanisms of action.
23580446	Pharmacological Inhibition of Platelet-tumor Cell Cross-talk Prevents Platelet-induced Overexpression of GENENOTIN in HT29 Human Colon Carcinoma Cells. GENEIN-derived CHEMICALIN can influence several processes that are linked to carcinogenesis. We aimed to address the hypothesis that platelets contribute to aberrant GENENOTIN expression in HT29 colon carcinoma cells and to reveal the role of platelet-induced GENENOTIN on the expression of proteins involved in malignancy and marker genes of epithelial-mesenchymal transition(EMT). Human platelets co-cultured with HT29 cells rapidly adhered to cancer cells and induced GENENOTIN mRNA expression, but not protein synthesis which required the late release of platelet GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA stabilization. Platelet-induced GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN synthesis in HT29 cells was involved in downregulation of GENEIN(GENEIN/GENEIN) and upregulation of GENEIN, since these effects were prevented by CHEMICALIN(a selective GENEIN inhibitor) and rescued by exogenous CHEMICALNOTIN. GENENOTIN, highly expressed in HT29 cells, is unique among galectins because it contains a GENENOTIN. Thus, we studied the role of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in platelet-induced GENENOTIN overexpression. Inhibitors of GENENOTIN function(CHEMICALNOTIN, a dominant-negative form of GENENOTIN,GENENOTIN, and anti-GENENOTIN antibody M3/38) or GENENOTIN-mediated platelet adhesion(revacept, a dimeric GENENOTIN GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN) prevented aberrant GENENOTIN expression. Inhibition of platelet-cancer cell interaction by revacept was more effective than CHEMICALNOTIN in preventing platelet-induced mRNA changes of EMT markers suggesting that direct cell-cell contact and aberrant GENENOTIN expression synergistically induced gene expression modifications associated with EMT. In conclusion, our findings provide the rationale for testing blockers of GENENOTIN, such as revacept, and GENENOTIN inhibitors in the prevention of colon cancer metastasis in animal models followed by studies in patients.
23495691	Targeting protein-protein interactions within the cyclic AMP signaling system as a therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease. The cAMP signaling system can trigger precise physiological cellular responses that depend on the fidelity of many protein-protein interactions, which act to bring together signaling intermediates at defined locations within cells. In the heart, cAMP participates in the fine control of excitation-contraction coupling, hence, any disregulation of this signaling cascade can lead to cardiac disease. Due to the ubiquitous nature of the cAMP pathway, general inhibitors of cAMP signaling proteins such as PKA, EPAC and PDEs would act non-specifically and universally, increasing the likelihood of serious 'off target' effects. Recent advances in the discovery of peptides and small molecules that disrupt the protein-protein interactions that underpin cellular targeting of cAMP signaling proteins are described and discussed.
22634361	Anxiolytic- but not antidepressant-like activity of CHEMICALIN, a novel, selective positive allosteric modulator of the GENEIN receptor. Previous studies demonstrated that the GENEIN-selective orthosteric agonist, CHEMICALIN produced anxiolytic- but not antidepressant-like effects upon peripheral administration. Herein, we report the pharmacological actions of CHEMICALIN, a novel, selective, and brain-penetrant positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of the GENEIN receptor in the stress-induced hyperthermia (SIH), four-plate, marble-burying and Vogel's conflict tests. In all models, except Vogel's conflict test, a dose-dependent anxiolytic-like effect was seen. The anti-hyperthermic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg/kg) in the SIH test was inhibited by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (10 mg/kg) and was not CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent, as it persisted in CHEMICALNOTIN-deficient mice and upon blockade of either GENEIN receptors by CHEMICALIN, or GENEIN receptors by CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that the GABAergic system, but not the serotonergic system, is involved in the mechanism of the anxiolytic-like phenotype of CHEMICALNOTIN in rodents. CHEMICALNOTIN did not produce antidepressant-like effects in the tail suspension test (TST) in mice; however, it decreased the basal locomotor activity of mice that were not habituated to activity cages. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'GENENOTIN'.
22921426	Lead-induced ER calcium release and inhibitory effects of methionine choline in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. Lead, a ubiquitous neurotoxicant, can result in learning and memory dysfunction. Long term potentiation in the hippocampus, a potential neural substrate for learning and memory, is thought to be linked to calcium-triggered intracellular events. In this study, laser scanning confocal microscopy was used to examine the effects of Pb(2+) on intracellular and endoplasmic reticulum free calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)](i) and [Ca(2+)](ER)) in cultured neonatal rat hippocampal neurons and their possible antagonism by methionine choline; understanding these effects would help explain the lead-induced cognitive and learning dysfunction and explore efficient safety and relief strategies. The results showed that Pb(2+) increased [Ca(2+)](i) and decreased [Ca(2+)](ER) linearly in a time- and concentration-dependant manner, and Pb(2+) addition after the applying of a ryanodine receptor (RyR) antagonist and an inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptor (IP(3)R) antagonist did not increase [Ca(2+)](i). The addition of 10, 20, or 40 mmol/L methionine choline simultaneously with addition of 10 Î¼mol/L Pb(2+) decreased [Ca(2+)](i) in Ca(2+)-free culture medium by 39.0%, 66.0%, and 61.6%, respectively, in a concentration-dependant manner in a certain dose range. Our results suggest that Pb(2+) induces ER calcium release to increase the resting [Ca(2+)](i); and methionine choline inhibit this increase in [Ca(2+)](i).
17979301	Critical CHEMICALIN in GENEIN catalytic site that provide for high-affinity interaction with CHEMICALIN and inhibitors. The molecular bases for GENEIN (GENEIN) catalytic-site affinity for CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and potency of inhibitors are poorly understood. Cocrystal structures of GENEIN with inhibitors reveal a CHEMICALNOTIN bond and hydrophobic interactions with CHEMICALIN-612, CHEMICALNOTIN bonds with CHEMICALIN-817, a hydrophobic clamp formed by CHEMICALIN-820 and CHEMICALIN-782, and contacts with CHEMICALIN-613, CHEMICALIN-765, and CHEMICALIN-786 [Sung et al. (2003) Nature 425, 98-102; Huai et al. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 13095-13101]. Present results of point mutations of full-length GENENOTIN showed that maximum catalysis was decreased 2650-fold in GENENOTIN and 55-fold in GENENOTIN. Catalytic-site affinities for CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) were respectively weakened 14-, 123-, 30-, 51-, and 43-fold for GENEIN; 63-, 511-, 43-, 95- and 61-fold for GENEIN; and 59-, 448-, 71-, 137-, and 93-fold for GENEIN. The data indicate that these three CHEMICALNOTIN are major determinants of affinity for CHEMICALNOTIN and potency of selective and nonselective inhibitors, and that higher CHEMICALNOTIN potency over CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN results from stronger contacts with CHEMICALNOTIN-612, CHEMICALNOTIN-817, and CHEMICALNOTIN-820. Affinity of GENEIN for CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN was reduced 5.5-, 23-, 10-, 3-, and 12-fold, respectively. Change in affinity for CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN in GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, or GENEIN was less, but affinity of GENEIN or GENEIN for CHEMICALIN was weakened 37- and 17-fold, respectively. The results quantify the role of GENEIN catalytic-site residues for CHEMICALIN and inhibitors, indicate that CHEMICALIN-612, CHEMICALIN-817, and CHEMICALIN-820 are the most important CHEMICALIN or inhibitor contacts studied, and identify residues that contribute to selectivity among different classes of inhibitors.
23411208	Alteration of Î±-tocopherol-associated protein (TAP) expression in human breast epithelial cells during breast cancer development. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women and has an age-specific incidence profile. Over the last decade, many studies have demonstrated the anticancer activity of Î±-tocopherol, the main and most active form of natural vitamin E. Î±-Tocopherol-associated protein (TAP) was found to be one of the major Î±-tocopherol binding proteins in human serum and in liver, brain, and prostate tissues. In this study, we found that reduced TAP expression was significantly correlated with Her2/neu receptor expression, breast cancer stage and nodal stage in paired normal and cancerous breast tissue samples from 93 patients using real-time PCR analysis. A cell viability assay showed that Î±-tocopheryl succinate (Î±-TOS), a synthetic derivative of Î±-tocopherol, enhanced the cells' sensitivity to doxorubicin and resulted in a reduction in cell viability in breast cancers. Taken together, these data suggest that the use of vitamin E or its analogue as a dietary supplement may be beneficial for the treatment of cancer.
23383423	International Union of Pharmacology. LXXXVII. GENENOTIN. The activation of the GENENOTIN cascade, a cornerstone of the innate immune response, produces a number of small (74-77 CHEMICALIN) fragments, originally termed GENEIN, that are potent chemoattractants and secretagogues that act on a wide variety of cell types. These fragments, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, participate at all levels of the immune response and are also involved in other processes such as neural development and organ regeneration. Their primary function, however, is in inflammation, so they are important targets for the development of antiinflammatory therapies. Only three receptors for complement peptides have been found, but there are no satisfactory antagonists as yet, despite intensive investigation. In humans, there is a single receptor for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), no known receptor for GENENOTIN, and two receptors for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN). The most recently characterized receptor, the GENENOTIN receptor (previously known as GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN), has been regarded as a passive binding protein, but signaling activities are now ascribed to it, so we propose that it be formally identified as a receptor and be given a name to reflect this. Here, we describe the complex biology of the complement peptides, introduce a new suggested nomenclature, and review our current knowledge of receptor pharmacology.
23583806	Short-term heating reduces the anti-inflammatory effects of fresh raw garlic extracts on the LPS-induced production of CHEMICALNOTIN and pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN by downregulating CHEMICALNOTIN activity in RAW 264.7 macrophages. Garlic has a variety of biologic activities, including anti-inflammatory properties. Although garlic has several biologic activities, some people dislike eating fresh raw garlic because of its strong taste and smell. Therefore, garlic formulations involving heating procedures have been developed. In this study, we investigated whether short-term heating affects the anti-inflammatory properties of garlic. Fresh and heated raw garlic extracts (FRGE and HRGE) were prepared with incubation at 25Â°C and 95Â°C, respectively, for 2h. Treatment with FRGE and HRGE significantly reduced the LPS-induced increase in the pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN concentration (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN through GENENOTIN upregulation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The anti-inflammatory effect was greater in FRGE than in HRGE. The CHEMICALNOTIN concentration was higher in FRGE than in HRGE. CHEMICALIN treatment showed reduced production of pro-inflammatory GENEIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and increased GENEIN activity. The results show that the decrease in LPS-induced CHEMICALNOTIN and pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN in RAW 264.7 macrophages through GENENOTIN induction was greater for FRGE compared with HRGE. Additionally, the results indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN is responsible for the anti-inflammatory effect of FRGE. Our results suggest a potential therapeutic use of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.
18058577	MORAb-003, a fully humanized monoclonal antibody against the folate receptor alpha, for the potential treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer. Morphotek Inc is developing MORAb-003, a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against folate receptor alpha, for the potential treatment of ovarian cancer. Phase II clinical trialsof MORAb-003, either alone or in combination with platinum/taxane chemotherapy, are underway in ovarian cancer patients experiencing their first disease recurrence.
17567713	Artificial sweeteners and salts producing a metallic taste sensation activate GENENOTIN receptors. Throughout the world many people use artificial sweeteners (AS) for the purpose of reducing caloric intake. The most prominently used of these molecules include CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Despite the caloric advantage they provide, one key concern in their use is their aversive aftertaste that has been characterized on a sensory level as bitter and/or metallic. Recently, it has been shown that the activation of particular GENEIN bitter taste receptors is partially involved with the bitter aftertaste sensation of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. To more fully understand the biology behind these phenomena we have addressed the question of whether AS could stimulate GENENOTIN, as these receptors are activated by a large range of structurally different chemicals. Moreover, GENENOTIN receptors and/or their variants are found in taste receptor cells and in nerve terminals throughout the oral cavity. Hence, GENENOTIN activation could be involved in the AS aftertaste or even contribute to the poorly understood metallic taste sensation. Using CHEMICALNOTIN imaging on GENENOTIN receptors heterologously expressed in the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells and on dissociated primary sensory neurons, we find that in both systems, AS activate GENENOTIN receptors, and, moreover, they sensitize these channels to acid and heat. We also found that GENEIN receptors are activated by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, three salts known to produce a metallic taste sensation. In summary, our results identify a novel group of compounds that activate GENENOTIN and, consequently, provide a molecular mechanism that may account for off tastes of sweeteners and metallic tasting salts.
23288052	Molecular mechanisms of fibrosis-associated promotion of liver carcinogenesis. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) mostly develops in patients with advanced fibrosis; however, the mechanisms of interaction between a genotoxic insult and fibrogenesis are not well understood. This study tested a hypothesis that fibrosis promotes HCC via a mechanism that involves activation of liver stem cells. First, B6C3F1 mice were administered diethylnitrosamine (DEN; single ip injection of 1mg/kg at 14 days of age). Second, carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4); 0.2ml/kg, 2/week ip starting at 8 weeks of age) was administered for 9 or 14 weeks to develop advanced liver fibrosis. In animals treated with DEN as neonates, presence of liver fibrosis led to more than doubling (to 100%) of the liver tumor incidence as early as 5 months of age. This effect was associated with activation of cells with progenitor features in noncancerous liver tissue, including markers of replicative senescence (p16), oncofetal transformation (Afp, H19, and Bex1), and increased "stemness" (Prom1 and Epcam). In contrast, the dose of DEN used did not modify the extent of liver inflammation, fibrogenesis, oxidative stress, proliferation, or apoptosis induced by subchronic CCl(4) administration. This study demonstrates the potential role of liver stem-like cells in the mechanisms of chemical-induced, fibrosis-promoted HCC. We posit that the combination of genotoxic and fibrogenic insults is a sensible approach to model liver carcinogenesis in experimental animals. These results may contribute to identification of cirrhotic patients predisposed to HCC by analyzing the expression of hepatic progenitor cell markers in the noncancerous liver tissue.
15974585	CHEMICALIN GENEIN (GENEIN) ligands as novel noncompetitive GENEIN inhibitors. The GENENOTIN GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN plays a major role in the activation and recruitment of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells at inflammatory sites. GENENOTIN activates PMNs by binding the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALIN (1) was previously reported to be a potent and specific noncompetitive inhibitor of GENEIN-induced human PMNs chemotaxis. We report here molecular modeling studies showing a putative interaction site of 1 in the TM region of GENENOTIN. The binding model was confirmed by CHEMICALNOTIN scanning mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling experiments. The molecular model driven medicinal chemistry optimization of 1 led to a new class of potent and specific inhibitors of GENENOTIN biological activity. Among these, CHEMICALNOTIN (13) was selected as a clinical candidate drug for prevention of post-ischemia reperfusion injury.
23221006	Role of GENEIN in uptake of CHEMICALIN and inhibitory effect on GENEIN respiration in mitochondria. CHEMICALIN causes lactic acidosis in clinical situations due to inhibition of GENEIN. It is reportedly taken up by hepatocytes and exhibits mitochondrial toxicity in the liver. In this study, uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN were examined in isolated liver and heart mitochondria. Uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN into isolated rat liver mitochondria was higher than that into heart mitochondria. It was inhibited by several cat ionic compounds, which suggests the involvement of multispecific transport system(s). Similar characteristics were also observed for uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN; however, uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN into mitochondria of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) knockout mice was lower than that in wild-type mice, whereas uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN was comparable between the two strains, suggesting the involvement of distinct transport mechanisms for these two cations in mitochondria. Inhibition by CHEMICALIN of CHEMICALNOTIN consumption via GENEIN respiration in isolated rat liver mitochondria was greater than that in heart mitochondria, whereas inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN respiration was similar in inside-out structured submitochondrial particles prepared from rat livers and hearts. Lactic acidosis provoked by iv infusion of CHEMICALNOTIN was weaker in GENENOTIN(-/-) mice than that in wild-type mice. These observations suggest that uptake of CHEMICALIN into liver mitochondria is at least partly mediated by GENEIN and functionally relevant to its inhibition potential of GENEIN respiration. This study was, thus, the first to demonstrate GENENOTIN-mediated mitochondrial transport and toxicity of biguanide in vivo in rodents.
23358258	Synthesis and biological evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives on GENENOTIN. A series of CHEMICALIN derivatives in which a CHEMICALNOTIN was inserted at position 8 of CHEMICALIN scaffold was synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of GENEIN (GENEIN) for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. As the results of structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the series, the compounds with CHEMICALNOTIN group at N-1 position and CHEMICALNOTIN group gave better activities. Compounds H4 and H9 showed good GENENOTIN inhibition and more than 100-fold selectivity over GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN.
15224175	GENEIN receptors, alpha2A/2C- and, to a lesser extent, GENEIN mediate the external carotid vasoconstriction to CHEMICALIN in vagosympathectomised dogs. It has previously been suggested that CHEMICALIN produces external carotid vasoconstriction in vagosympathectomised dogs via GENEIN receptors and GENEIN. The present study has reanalysed this suggestion by using more selective antagonists alone and in combination. Fifty-two anaesthetised dogs were prepared for ultrasonic measurements of external carotid blood flow. The animals were divided into thirteen groups (n=4 each) receiving an i.v. bolus injection of, either physiological saline (0.3 ml/kg; control), or the antagonists CHEMICALIN (300 microg/kg; GENEIN), CHEMICALIN (300 microg/kg; GENEIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg; alpha2), CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg each), CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg each), CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg each), CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microg/kg; alpha1), CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microg/kg), CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microg/kg), CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2A), CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microg/kg)+ CHEMICALNOTIN (1,000 microg/kg; alpha2B), or CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (100 microg/kg) + CHEMICALNOTIN (300 microg/kg; alpha2C). Each group received consecutive 1-min intracarotid infusions of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.56, 1, 1.8, 3.1, 5.6, 10 and 18 microg/min), following a cumulative schedule. In saline-pretreated animals, CHEMICALNOTIN induced dose-dependent decreases in external carotid blood flow without affecting arterial blood pressure or heart rate. These control responses were: unaffected by CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or the combinations of CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN; slightly blocked by CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN; and markedly blocked by CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN + CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, the cranio-selective vasoconstriction elicited by CHEMICALIN in dogs is predominantly mediated by GENEIN receptors as well as GENENOTIN subtypes and, to a lesser extent, by GENEIN.
11692072	Influence of the GENENOTIN genotype on efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN and clinical outcome of CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal. We tested the hypothesis that allelic variants of the GENENOTIN genotype are associated with (i) GENENOTIN antagonist tiapride dose in treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal (n = 50) and (ii) with anxiety and depression in patients during alcoholism detoxification therapy (admission n = 87; discharge n = 50). GENENOTIN A/A genotype was associated with increased dose of CHEMICALNOTIN during a 9-day detoxification therapy and with increased anxiety and depression scores on admission and 2 weeks later. The findings suggest a pharmacogenetic influence of GENENOTIN genotype on tiapride efficacy in alcohol withdrawal. In an earlier report, GENENOTIN E8 A/A genotype was associated with reduced responsiveness to the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN; however, it is not clear whether both findings share the same biological basis. Earlier findings concerning association of GENENOTIN A/A with increased anxiety and depression are replicated for the first time.
23318471	CHEMICALNOTIN mediates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced vasodilation of microvascular resistance vessels. Our knowledge of how CHEMICALNOTIN influence the cardiovascular system is far from complete, and this lack of understanding is especially true of how CHEMICALNOTIN affect resistance vessels. Our aim was to identify the signaling mechanisms stimulated by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in microvascular arteries and to understand how these mechanisms mediate CHEMICALNOTIN-induced vasodilation. Mesenteric microvessels were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Tension studies demonstrated a rapid, concentration-dependent, vasodilatory response to CHEMICALNOTIN that did not involve protein synthesis or aromatization to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN fluorescence and CHEMICALNOTIN immunoblot experiments indicated that CHEMICALNOTIN stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN formation in microvessels, and functional studies demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN-induced vasodilation was inhibited by scavenging CHEMICALNOTIN. As predicted, CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced the production of both CHEMICALNOTIN precursors (i.e., CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN), and GENEIN was identified as the likely source of CHEMICALIN-stimulated CHEMICALIN production. Functional and biochemical studies indicated that CHEMICALIN signaling involved activity of the GENEIN-GENEIN (GENEIN) cascade initiated by activation of the GENEIN and culminated in enhanced production of CHEMICALNOTIN and microvascular vasodilation. These findings, derived from a variety of analytical and functional approaches, provide evidence for a novel nongenomic signaling mechanism for CHEMICALNOTIN action in the microvasculature: CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated vasodilation mediated primarily by CHEMICALIN formed from GENEIN-generated CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. This response was associated with activation of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN signaling cascade initiated by activation of the GENENOTIN. We propose this mechanism could account for CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN production in microvessels and, ultimately, vasodilation.
12560076	GENEIN catalyzes specific elimination of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN was previously identified in mammalian brain and was shown to be a co-agonist at the 'CHEMICALIN' site of the GENEIN. Racemization of CHEMICALIN is catalyzed by GENEIN, a CHEMICALIN-dependent enzyme expressed mainly in brain and liver. GENENOTIN overactivation has been implicated in a number of pathological conditions and inhibitors of GENENOTIN are thus potentially interesting targets for therapy. We expressed recombinant GENENOTIN in insect cells and purified it to near homogeneity. The enzyme is a non-covalent homodimer in solution and requires divalent cations CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN for activity but not for dimerization. In addition to the racemization it also catalyzes specific elimination of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is eliminated much less efficiently. Both CHEMICALNOTIN racemization and elimination activities of CHEMICALNOTIN racemase are of comparable magnitude, display CHEMICALNOTIN pH optimum and are negligible below pH 6.5.
17148442	GENENOTIN repeat and suppressors of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN targets GENENOTIN for degradation. The GENENOTIN inhibit GENENOTIN action by direct interaction with GENENOTIN or activated GENENOTIN. In addition to the CHEMICALIN-terminal and GENEIN that mediate these interactions, GENENOTIN proteins contain a CHEMICALIN-terminal GENEIN. DNA data base searches have identified a number of other protein families that possess a GENENOTIN, of which the GENENOTIN repeat and GENENOTIN-containing (GENENOTIN) proteins constitute the largest. Although it is known that the GENENOTIN proteins are involved in the negative regulation of GENENOTIN signaling, the biological and biochemical functions of the GENENOTIN are largely undefined. Using a proteomics approach, we demonstrate that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) interacts with GENENOTIN in a specific, GENENOTIN-independent manner. This interaction increases the polyubiquitylation of GENENOTIN and decreases total GENENOTIN levels within the cell. The targeting of GENENOTIN for degradation by GENENOTIN was primarily GENENOTIN-dependent and suggests that GENENOTIN acts as a specific GENENOTIN regulating levels of this evolutionarily conserved enzyme.
3058238	Tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer--a randomized study. A prospective randomized trial of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone versus tamoxifen and danazol in metastatic breast cancer was conducted from December 1980 to September 1985. Patients were eligible regardless of site of disease, estrogen receptor status, or age. Sixty-two of sixty-three randomized patients were evaluable for response. Overall response for tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone was 11% with 61% stabilization of disease, versus 12% response rate for tamoxifen and danazol with 59% stabilization. Toxicities with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone were greater with an increase in masculinization. We conclude that the response rates to the combinations of tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone or tamoxifen and danazol reported are equivalent in this study but that the increased toxicity with tamoxifen and fluoxymesterone would make tamoxifen and danazol the treatment of choice if a combination were to be used.
23524316	Effect of quercetin-rich onion peel extracts on arterial thrombosis in rats. The aim of this study was to examine whether oral supplementation of quercetin-rich onion peel extract (OPE) influences blood coagulation and arterial thrombosis in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. 24 male rats, 5weeks old, were divided into three groups with different diets (C: control, 2mg OPE: chow diet with 2mg OPE supplementation, 10mg OPE: chow diet with 10mg OPE supplementation) for 6weeks. Blood coagulation parameters including prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and platelet aggregation were examined. The OPE did not affect blood cholesterol levels but significantly decreased blood triglyceride and glucose levels. PT, aPTT and platelet aggregation were not significantly different among all tested groups. However, in vivo arterial thrombosis was significantly delayed in groups that were fed 2mg and 10mg OPE diets compared to the control group. In addition, the OPE greatly diminished thrombin-induced expression of tissue factor in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), a coagulation initiator. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathways activated by thrombin treatment were prevented by the OPE pre-treatment. These results indicate that OPE may have anti-thrombotic effects through restricting the induced expression of tissue factor via down-regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation upon coagulation stimulus, leading to the prolongation of time for arterial thrombosis.
12668276	Thyroid hormone receptors/THR genes in human cancer. Thyroid hormone (triiodothyronine, T3) is a pleiotropic regulator of growth, differentiation and tissue homeostasis in higher organisms that acts through the control of target gene expression. Most, if not all, major T3 actions are mediated by specific high affinity nuclear receptors (TR) which are encoded by two genes, THRA and THRB. Several TRalpha and TRbeta receptor isoforms are expressed. Abundant and contradictory literature exists on the relationship between circulating thyroid hormone levels, thyroid diseases and human cancer. In 1986, a connection between TR and cancer became evident when the chicken TRalpha1 was characterized as the c-erbA proto-oncogene, the cellular counterpart of the retroviral v-erbA oncogene. V-erbA causes erythroleukemias and sarcomas in birds, and hepatocellular carcinomas in transgenic mice. In recent years, many studies have analyzed the presence of quantitative (abnormal levels) or qualitative (mutations) alterations in the expression of THR genes in different types of human neoplasias. While their role in tumor generation or progression is currently unclear, both gross chromosomal and minor mutations (deletions, aberrant splicing, point mutations) and changes in the level of expression of THRA and THRB genes have been found. Together with other in vitro data indicating connections between TR and p53, Rb, cyclin D and other cell cycle regulators and oncogenes, these results suggest that THRA and THRB may be involved in human cancer.
17161452	CHEMICALIN dose and the pharmacogenomics of GENEIN and GENEIN - rationale and perspectives. CHEMICALNOTIN is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant, but there is greater than 10-fold interindividual variability in the dose required to attain a therapeutic response. Information from pharmacogenomics, the study of the interaction of an individual's genotype and drug response, can help optimize drug efficacy while minimizing adverse drug reactions. Pharmacogenetic analysis of two genes, the CHEMICALIN metabolic enzyme GENEIN and CHEMICALIN target enzyme, GENEIN GENEIN, confirmed their influence on CHEMICALNOTIN maintenance dose. Possession of GENEIN*2 or GENEIN*3 variant alleles, which result in decreased enzyme activity, is associated with a significant decrease in the mean CHEMICALIN dose. Several single CHEMICALNOTIN polymorphisms (SNPs) in GENEIN are associated with CHEMICALIN dose across the normal dose range. Haplotypes based on these SNPs explain a large fraction of the interindividual variation in CHEMICALNOTIN dose, and GENENOTIN has an approximately three-fold greater effect than GENENOTIN. Algorithms incorporating genetic (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), demographic, and clinical factors to estimate the CHEMICALNOTIN dosage, could potentially minimize the risk of over dose during CHEMICALNOTIN induction.
21631396	CHEMICALIN inhibits T-cell activation by targeting GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN signaling pathways. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a stereoisomer of CHEMICALNOTIN that is commonly used as a nasal decongestant in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs for the symptomatic treatment of some common pathologies such as common cold. Herein, we describe for the first time the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on T-cell activation events. We found that CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of CHEMICALNOTIN at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) transcription factors and found that CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic GENEIN, GENEIN or the DNA-binding activity. However, phosphorylation of the GENEIN/GENEIN subunit was clearly inhibited by CHEMICALIN in stimulated cells. In addition, CHEMICALIN inhibited the transcriptional activity of GENEIN without interfering with the CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. GENENOTIN cooperates with GENENOTIN, a compound of the GENENOTIN complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that CHEMICALIN inhibited both GENEIN activation and GENEIN transcriptional activity. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the potential immunomodulatory activities of CHEMICALNOTIN and highlight their potential in designing novel therapeutic strategies to manage inflammatory diseases.
15932636	CHEMICALIN activity against Brugia malayi microfilariae is dependent on GENEIN and the GENEIN pathway. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been used for many years in the treatment of human lymphatic filariasis. Its mode of action is not well understood, but it is known to interact with the CHEMICALNOTIN pathway. Here we have investigated the contribution of the CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN (GENENOTIN) pathways to the activity of CHEMICALIN against B. malayi microfilariae in mice. METHODS: B. malayi microfilariae were injected intravenously into mice and parasitaemia was measured 24 hours later. CHEMICALNOTIN was then administered to BALB/c mice with and without pre-treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN and the parasitaemia monitored. To investigate a role for inducible CHEMICALNOTIN in DEC's activity, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were administered to microfilaraemic GENENOTIN-/- mice and their background strain (129/SV). Western blot analysis was used to determine any effect of CHEMICALIN on the production of GENEIN and inducible GENEIN (GENEIN) proteins. RESULTS: DEC administered alone to BALB/c mice resulted in a rapid and profound reduction in circulating microfilariae within five minutes of treatment. Microfilarial levels began to recover after 24 hours and returned to near pre-treatment levels two weeks later, suggesting that the sequestration of microfilariae occurs independently of parasite killing. Pre-treatment of animals with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN reduced DEC's efficacy by almost 90% or 56%, respectively, supporting a role for the CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN pathways in vivo. Furthermore, experiments showed that treatment with CHEMICALIN results in a reduction in the amount of GENEIN protein in peritoneal exudate cells. Additionally, in GENENOTIN-/- mice infected with B. malayi microfilariae, CHEMICALNOTIN showed no activity, whereas the efficacy of another antifilarial drug, CHEMICALNOTIN, was unaffected. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the important role of the CHEMICALNOTIN metabolic pathway in DEC's mechanism of action in vivo and show that in addition to its effects on the GENENOTIN pathway, it targets the GENENOTIN pathway and GENENOTIN. Moreover, we show for the first time that inducible CHEMICALNOTIN is essential for the rapid sequestration of microfilariae by CHEMICALNOTIN.
12213829	GENENOTIN-dependent modulation of GENENOTIN by an CHEMICALIN-terminal GENEIN peptide. Defining intersubunit gating interactions. Ntp and Ctp, synthetic peptides based on the CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-terminal sequences of GENEIN, respectively, were used to probe gating of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Micromolar Ntp dose-dependently increased the mean open channel probability in ligand-free solution (P(O(max))) and attenuated the CHEMICALIN inhibition of GENEIN/GENEIN, but had no effect on homomeric GENENOTIN channels. Ntp (up to approximately 10(-4) m) did not affect significantly the mean open or "fast," CHEMICALNOTIN driving force-dependent, intraburst closed times, verifying that Ntp selectively modulates the ratio of mean burst to interburst times. Ctp and Rnp, a randomized Ntp, had no effect, indicating that the effects of Ntp are structure specific. Ntp opened GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN channels normally silent in the absence of stimulatory Mg(-) CHEMICALNOTIN and attenuated the coupling of high-affinity CHEMICALIN binding with GENEIN pore closure. These effects resemble those seen with CHEMICALIN-terminal deletions (DeltaN) of GENEIN, and application of Ntp to GENEIN decreased their P(O(max)) and apparent IC(50) for CHEMICALIN in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN. The results are consistent with a competition between Ntp and the endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN terminus for a site of interaction on the cytoplasmic face of the channel or with partial replacement of the deleted CHEMICALNOTIN terminus by Ntp, respectively. The GENEIN CHEMICALIN terminus and the TMD0-L0 segment of GENENOTIN are known to control the P(O(max)). The L0 linker has been reported to be required for CHEMICALNOTIN binding, and GENEIN/GENEIN channels exhibit reduced labeling of GENEIN with CHEMICALIN, implying that the GENEIN CHEMICALIN terminus and L0 of GENENOTIN are in proximity. We hypothesize that L0 interacts with the GENEIN CHEMICALIN terminus in ligand-inhibited GENENOTIN and put forward a model, based on the architecture of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and the GENENOTIN channel, in which TMD0-L0 links the GENENOTIN-like core of GENENOTIN with the GENENOTIN pore.
15953344	GENENOTIN in the central nervous system: distribution, regulation and function. GENEIN (GENEIN) are proton-linked membrane carriers involved in the transport of CHEMICALIN such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, as well as CHEMICALIN bodies. They belong to a larger family of transporters composed of 14 members in mammals based on sequence homologies. GENENOTIN are found in various tissues including the brain where three isoforms, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, have been described. Each of these isoforms exhibits a distinct regional and cellular distribution in rodent brain. At the cellular level, GENENOTIN is expressed by endothelial cells of microvessels, by ependymocytes as well as by astrocytes. GENENOTIN expression appears to be specific for astrocytes. By contrast, the predominant neuronal GENENOTIN is GENENOTIN. Interestingly, part of GENEIN immunoreactivity is located at postsynaptic sites, suggesting a particular role of CHEMICALIN and their transporters in synaptic transmission. In addition to variation in expression during development and upon nutritional modifications, new data indicate that GENENOTIN expression is regulated at the translational level by neurotransmitters. Understanding how transport of CHEMICALNOTIN is regulated could be of particular importance not only for neuroenergetics but also for areas such as functional brain imaging, regulation of food intake and CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis, or for central nervous system disorders such as ischaemia and neurodegenerative diseases.
23087261	Lysine 48-linked polyubiquitination of organic anion transporter-1 is essential for its protein kinase C-regulated endocytosis. Organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1) mediates the body's disposition of a diverse array of environmental toxins and clinically important drugs. Therefore, understanding the regulation of this transporter has profound clinical significance. We had previously established that OAT1 undergoes constitutive internalization from and recycling back to the cell surface and that acute activation of protein kinase C (PKC) inhibits OAT1 activity by reducing OAT1 cell-surface expression through accelerating its internalization from cell surface to intracellular compartments. However, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the current study, we provide novel evidence that acute activation of PKC significantly enhances OAT1 ubiquitination both in vitro and ex vivo. We further show that ubiquitination of cell-surface OAT1 increases in cells transfected with dominant negative mutant of dynamin-2, a maneuver blocking OAT1 internalization, which suggests that OAT1 ubiquitination proceeds before OAT1 internalization. Mass spectroscopy has revealed that ubiquitination of OAT1 consists of polyubiquitin chains, primarily through lysine 48 linkage. Transfection of cells with the dominant negative mutant of ubiquitin Ub-K48R, which prevents the formation of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains, abolishes PKC-stimulated OAT1 ubiquitination and internalization. Together, our findings demonstrate for the first time that Lys48-linked polyubiquitination is essential for PKC-regulated OAT1 trafficking.
22445601	Differentiating the roles of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors using CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN agonist/GENEIN antagonist. Despite the potential therapeutic relevance of GENENOTIN, there has been a lack of pharmacological tools for separating the roles of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptor subtypes. CHEMICALIN was claimed from GENEIN expressed in non-neuronal cells to be a selective orthosteric GENEIN agonist and GENEIN antagonist. We have verified this pharmacological profile of CHEMICALNOTIN in hippocampal slices. Field excitatory post-synaptic potentials (fEPSPs) evoked by stimulation of the temporo-ammonic path (TAP) input to CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM) were inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN in GENENOTIN-/- mice (EC(50) 38 nM) and wild-type littermates (EC(50) 42 nM) to a similar extent but were not significantly affected in GENENOTIN-/- mice. The group II agonist, DCG-IV, inhibited the fEPSP in all three genotypes. Co-application of DCG-IV and CHEMICALNOTIN in GENENOTIN-/- and wild-type littermates resulted in an additive effect, whereas in GENENOTIN-/- mice, CHEMICALNOTIN reversed the inhibitory action of DCG-IV. These results confirm the selective GENEIN agonist and GENEIN antagonist actions of CHEMICALIN. A similar profile of activity was seen in medial perforant path synapse to the dentate gyrus. Systemic administration of CHEMICALNOTIN to wild-type mice, reduced the increase in locomotor activity following both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN administration. These data support the hypothesis that GENENOTIN receptors mediate the antipsychotic effects of mixed group II agonists. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'GENENOTIN'.
6227474	Characterization of GENEIN reveals high affinity for CHEMICALIN. The two CHEMICALNOTIN-binding proteins of rat brain cytosol were characterized by a dextran-coated charcoal method. With CHEMICALNOTIN present to stabilize receptors, the affinities of the two sites for CHEMICALNOTIN in adrenalectomized perfused rat brain cytosols were 0.28 and 18.0 nM at 4 C. High affinity sites comprised 15% of the total receptor number. A small contamination of perfused brain cytosol preparations with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was found. However, due to the very high affinity of GENEIN for CHEMICALIN at 4 C, this slight contamination resulted in significant alterations in the apparent affinity of CHEMICALNOTIN competing for CHEMICALNOTIN-binding sites. Selective precipitation of cytosol receptors with 36% CHEMICALIN reduced GENEIN concentrations to negligible levels. After blockade of low affinity sites with a highly selective glucocorticoid (CHEMICALNOTIN), the order of CHEMICALNOTIN in competing for the high affinity receptor was CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN. Readdition of a small quantity of dialyzed serum to cytosol preparations yielded a profile of CHEMICALIN binding similar to that of the kidney GENEIN (CHEMICALIN greater than CHEMICALIN greater than CHEMICALNOTIN). The distribution of both receptors in brain regions of adrenalectomized rats was determined. Both receptors were at greatest density in the hippocampus and lowest density in the hypothalamus. The high affinity site was at greatest density in limbic regions, whereas the low affinity receptor, apparently identical to the GENENOTIN, was at greatest density in cortex and cerebellum. It is concluded that the high affinity GENENOTIN of rat brain, which had been identified in preliminary studies as a GENENOTIN, may bind either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN in vivo.
16809928	Acromegaly: molecular expression of GENENOTIN subtypes and treatment outcome. About a third of acromegalic patients are resistant to the currently commercially available CHEMICALNOTIN analogs (SA) CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Such resistance is related to an overall reduction of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) density or to a differentiated expression of GENENOTIN subtypes. There are five known GENENOTIN subtypes. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are usually expressed in GENENOTIN-secreting pituitary tumors, and both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN bind preferentially to GENEIN and, to a lesser extent, to GENEIN. SA inhibitory effects on GENENOTIN secretion and tumor cell proliferation can occur together or be dissociated events, depending on the tumor expression of GENENOTIN subtypes involved in each mechanism. The development of specific CHEMICALNOTIN subtypes analogs, mainly for GENENOTIN, of a GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN bispecific compound, and of a "universal" analog with high affinity to GENENOTIN showed preliminary, albeit promising results for the treatment of resistant somatotropic adenomas.
23373869	REMNANT UPTAKE AS A POSTOPERATIVE ONCOLOGIC QUALITY INDICATOR. BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of remnant uptake on postoperative radioiodine scans as an oncologic indicator after thyroidectomy for differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC). METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of patients undergoing total thyroidectomy for DTC and subsequent radioactive iodine (RAI) treatment. Of the eight surgeons included, three were considered high volume, performing at least 20 thyroidectomies per year. Patients with distant metastases at diagnosis or poorly differentiated variants were excluded. To control for the effect of varying RAI doses, the remnant uptake was analyzed as a ratio of the percentage uptake to the dose received (uptake to dose ratio, UDR). Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine the influence of UDR on recurrence. RESULTS: Of the 223 patients who met inclusion criteria, 21 patients (9.42%) experienced a recurrence. Those who recurred had a ten-fold higher UDR compared to those who did not recur (0.030 vs. 0.003, p = 0.001). Similarly, patients with increasing postoperative thyroglobulin measurements (0.339 vs. 0.003, p<0.001) also had significantly greater UDRs compared to those with stable thyroglobulin. The UDRs of high volume surgeons were significantly smaller than low volume surgeons (0.003 vs. 0.025, p = 0.002). When combined with other known predictors for recurrence, UDR (OR 3.71, C.I 1.05 - 13.10, p = 0.041) was significantly associated with recurrence. High volume surgeons maintained a low level of permanent complications across all UDRs whereas low volume surgeons had greater permanent complications associated with higher uptake.
23360412	Bioactivation of the nasal toxicant CHEMICALNOTIN: an assessment of metabolic activity in human nasal mucosa and identification of indicators of exposure and potential toxicity. The herbicide CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a potent nasal toxicant in rodents; however, it is not known whether CHEMICALNOTIN causes similar nasal toxicity in humans. The tissue-selective toxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN in mouse nasal mucosa is largely dependent on target tissue bioactivation by GENENOTIN. The human orthologues of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, are both expressed in nasal mucosa and are capable of activating CHEMICALNOTIN. In this study, we directly determined the ability of human nasal mucosa to bioactivate CHEMICALNOTIN. We also tested the suitability of a CHEMICALNOTIN conjugate of CHEMICALNOTIN (GS-CHEMICALNOTIN) or its derivatives as biomarkers of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure and nasal toxicity in mouse models. We found that human fetal nasal mucosa microsomes catalyze the formation of GS-CHEMICALNOTIN, with a Km value comparable to that of adult mouse nasal mucosa microsomes. The activity of the human nasal mucosa microsomes was inhibited by CHEMICALIN, a known GENEIN inhibitor. GS-CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolites were detected in the nasal mucosa and nasal-wash fluid obtained from CHEMICALNOTIN-treated mice, in amounts that increased with escalations in CHEMICALNOTIN dose, and they were all still detectable at 24 h after a CHEMICALNOTIN treatment (at 10 mg/kg). Further studies in GENENOTIN-null mice indicated that GS-CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid were generated in the nasal mucosa, rather than in other organs. Thus, our data indicate for the first time that the human nasal mucosa is capable of bioactivating CHEMICALNOTIN and that GS-CHEMICALNOTIN and its metabolites in nasal-wash fluid may collectively serve as indicators of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure and potential nasal toxicity in humans.
3345199	Effects of some CHEMICALNOTIN compounds on the reactivatability of CHEMICALIN-inhibited GENEIN in vitro. GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibited by the CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) rapidly becomes resistant to reactivation by CHEMICALIN due to dealkylation of the CHEMICALNOTIN-enzyme complex. This reaction is called aging. The effect of the four CHEMICALNOTIN compounds CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the reactivatability of CHEMICALIN-inhibited, solubilized GENEIN from human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro. All compounds were reversible inhibitors of GENENOTIN; the respective dissociation constants and the type of inhibition exhibited considerable differences. The affinities to both the active and the allosteric site were considerably higher for CHEMICALNOTIN (Kii 81.3 microM; Ki 15.9 microM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (Kii 15.4 microM; Ki 4.4 microM) than for CHEMICALNOTIN (Kii 1 mM; Ki 289.6 microM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (Kii 4.5 mM; Ki 331.8 microM). The reactivation experiments were performed in a four-step procedure (CHEMICALNOTIN-inhibition at 0 degree and pH 10, aging at 37 degrees and pH 7.3, reactivation by the CHEMICALNOTIN HI 6 at 37 degrees and pH 7.3 followed by GENENOTIN assay). After these four steps (total duration 55 min), GENENOTIN was inhibited by soman to 95-100%. HI 6 could reactivate about 20% of the inhibited enzyme. All effectors increased the GENENOTIN reactivatability by HI 6 when added before aging was started. The maximal increase in reactivatability was higher in the presence of 1.6 mM CHEMICALNOTIN (+35.8%) and 150 microM CHEMICALNOTIN (+40%) than of 22 mM CHEMICALNOTIN (+22.5%) and 8.3 mM CHEMICALNOTIN (+19.2%). If the effectors were added after 5 min of aging they increased the activity of CHEMICALIN-inhibited GENEIN, but to a considerably smaller extent than HI 6. A good correlation of the respective Kii values and the effective concentrations of these drugs was observed, indicating that an allosteric binding site of GENENOTIN might be involved in the protective effect of these drugs.
11278845	Atp-bound GENENOTIN as a target for antitumor drugs. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) poisons interfere with the breakage/reunion reaction of GENENOTIN resulting in DNA cleavage. In the current studies, we show that two different classes (CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive and -insensitive) of GENENOTIN poisons can be identified based on their differential sensitivity to the CHEMICALIN-bound conformation of GENEIN. First, in the presence of 1 mm CHEMICALNOTIN or the nonhydrolyzable analog CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN-mediated DNA cleavage induced by CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive GENEIN poisons (e.g. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) was 30-100-fold stimulated, whereas DNA cleavage induced by CHEMICALNOTIN-insensitive GENEIN poisons (e.g. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) was only slightly (less than 3-fold) affected. In addition, CHEMICALIN was shown to strongly antagonize GENEIN-mediated DNA cleavage induced by CHEMICALIN-sensitive but not CHEMICALNOTIN-insensitive GENENOTIN poisons. Second, GENENOTIN mutant GENENOTIN, which exhibits reduced GENEIN activity, was shown to exhibit cross-resistance to all CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive but not CHEMICALIN-insensitive GENENOTIN poisons. Third, using CHEMICALIN competition assay, GENEIN-mediated DNA cleavage induced by CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive but not CHEMICALNOTIN-insensitive poisons was shown to be antagonized by CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that CHEMICALIN-bound GENEIN may be the specific target of CHEMICALIN-sensitive GENENOTIN poisons. Using GENENOTIN as roadblocks, we show that CHEMICALIN-bound GENEIN acts as a circular clamp capable of entering DNA ends and sliding on unobstructed duplex DNA.
23297831	Tunable morphology and mesophase formation by naphthalene-containing poly(aryl ether) dendron-based low-molecular-weight fluorescent gels. Novel poly(aryl ether) dendron-based low-molecular-weight organogelaters (LMWG) containing naphthalene units at the core have been synthesized, and the self-assembly of the system has been examined in a variety of solvents and solvent mixtures. The compounds readily form gels with attractive critical gel concentration values associated with gelation-induced enhanced emission (GIEE). In addition to the remarkable properties of the previously reported anthracene and pyrene analogues (Rajamalli, P.; Prasad, E. Org. Lett.2011, 13, 3714 and Rajamalli, P.; Prasad, E. Soft Matter2012, 8, 8896), the self-assembled systems exhibit distinctly different structure-property relationships. Unlike the reported ones, the present system forms sheetlike morphology in nonpolar solvent mixtures, giant vesicles in polar solvent mixtures, and lamellar or hexagonal columnar phases in single solvents. The unique properties of the self-assembled systems, which were analyzed through electron microscopic (SEM, TEM, AFM) and spectroscopic techniques (POM, fluorescence), are attributed to the replacement of anthracene/pyrene units by naphthalene units. The present work unravels the subtle role of minute structural change in altering the properties of LMWGs based on poly(aryl ether) dendrons.
14613270	Turnover of type II collagen and aggrecan in cartilage matrix at the onset of inflammatory arthritis in humans: relationship to mediators of systemic and local inflammation. OBJECTIVE: To determine in vivo the extent of damage to, and changes in turnover of, articular cartilage type II collagen (CII) and the proteoglycan aggrecan following the onset of inflammatory arthritis in humans, and to examine the hypothesis that there are direct relationships between cartilage biomarkers of damage/turnover and clinical, histologic, and molecular markers of inflammation. METHODS: Synovial fluid (SF) and synovial membrane (SM) were obtained by arthroscopy, and a synovitis score was determined, in 32 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (13 with early untreated disease, 19 with established disease), 18 with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and 10 with osteoarthritis (OA). Systemic disease activity markers were recorded, and SM CD3+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, CD68+ macrophages, and lining layer hyperplasia were quantified. SF levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-10 (IL-10), matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, Col2-3/4C(Long mono) neoepitope (C2C) (reflecting collagenase cleavage of cartilage CII), C-propeptide of type II procollagen (PIICP) (a biosynthesis marker), keratan sulfate (KS), and the 846 epitope of aggrecan (turnover) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or radioimmunoassay. RESULTS: Levels of cartilage degradation products in early RA or early PsA were not elevated above levels in OA, although in early inflammatory arthritis, TNFalpha and MMP-1 levels were similar to those observed in late inflammatory disease and higher than those in OA. PIICP was reduced in early RA. Correlations were observed between the SF C2C neoepitope level and the Health Assessment Questionnaire score, C-reactive protein level, plasma viscosity, synovitis score, and SF TNFalpha and MMP-1 levels. KS epitope content was reduced in direct relation to SM macrophage infiltration in the sublining and lining layers and in the presence of elevated SF MMP-3. Both SF MMP-1 and SF MMP-3 levels correlated with CD4+ T cell infiltration and lining layer hyperplasia in the SM, and MMP-1 levels correlated with lining layer CD68 levels, but TNFalpha and IL-10 levels did not. CONCLUSION: Except for CII synthesis, there were no significant changes in extracellular matrix turnover of aggrecan or CII in the early stages of human inflammatory arthritis. However, the direct correlation between the increases in TNFalpha and MMP-1 production and collagen degradation suggests that collagenase cleavage of cartilage collagen is related to the activities of TNFalpha and MMP-1. The reduction in CII synthesis in early RA may contribute to the developing pathology, since a lack of synthesis of this molecule would inhibit maintenance of cartilage matrix.
23500772	Activation of GENEIN with CHEMICALIN attenuates diabetes induced myocardial injury in rats. This study assessed changes in myocardial GENENOTIN expression in the diabetic rat, in particular the diabetic rat pretreated with GENEIN activator CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). The rats were divided into six groups: control, CHEMICALNOTIN control, diabetic rat at 4th week (DM4W), 8th week (DM8W), 12th week (DM12W) and CHEMICALNOTIN+DM8W groups. Compared with control group, fasting blood CHEMICALNOTIN (FBG) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) levels were increased in DM groups. GENENOTIN level in DM12W group was higher than in DM4W group, GENEIN level in CHEMICALIN+DM8W group was lower than in DM8W group. Compared with control group, there were no changes of LVDP, HR and Â±dp/dtmax in DM4W group, but there were decreased in DM8W and DM12W groups, and increased in the CHEMICALNOTIN+DM8W group. In DM groups, GENENOTIN activity, GENENOTIN mRNA and protein levels were reduced, CHEMICALNOTIN content was increased compared with control group; which decreased further as diabetes progressed. Compared with DM8W group, GENEIN and GENEIN in CHEMICALIN+DM8W group was increased, CHEMICALNOTIN was decreased. Our results indicated with the development of diabetes, myocardial GENENOTIN expression was further decreased accompanying decreased ventricular function. However, activation of GENENOTIN can decrease diabetes induced myocardial injury. GENENOTIN may be one key endogenous cardiac protective factor in diabetic individuals.
15078100	Kinetic mechanism of GENEIN and its inhibition by the antimalarial CHEMICALIN. GENEIN (GENEIN) purified from human red blood cells was recently shown to be a potential target of the CHEMICALIN antimalarial compounds [Graves et al., (2002) Mol. Pharmacol. 62, 1364]. GENEIN catalyzes the two-electron reduction of CHEMICALIN via the oxidation of CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. To investigate the mechanism and consequences of inhibition of GENEIN by the CHEMICALIN further, we have used steady-state and transient-state kinetics to define the mechanism of GENEIN. Importantly, we have shown that GENENOTIN when isolated from an overproducing strain of E. coli is kinetically equivalent to the enzyme from the native human red blood cell source. We observe ping-pong kinetics consistent with one substrate/inhibitor binding site that shows selectivity for the oxidation state of the FAD cofactor, suggesting that selective inhibition of the liver versus red blood cell forms of malaria may be possible. The reductant CHEMICALNOTIN and the inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN bind exclusively to the oxidized enzyme. In contrast, the inhibitors CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN bind exclusively to the reduced enzyme. The CHEMICALNOTIN substrate CHEMICALNOTIN, on the other hand, binds nonspecifically to both forms of the enzyme. Single-turnover kinetics of the reductive half-reaction are chemically and kinetically competent and confirm the inhibitor selectivity seen in the steady-state experiments. Our studies shed light on the possible in vivo potency of the CHEMICALIN and provide a foundation for future studies aimed at creating more potent GENEIN inhibitors and at understanding the physiological significance of GENENOTIN.
23531031	GENENOTIN INHIBITION AFFECTS GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) EXPRESSION AND INDUCES CHEMICALNOTIN CYTOTOXICITY IN ANAPLASTIC THYROID CANCER CELLS. Background: Anaplastic thyroid cancers (ATC) represent only 1-2% of all thyroid tumors, but they account for up to 50% of the mortality. Treatment of differentiated thyroid carcinomas is well standardized and the use of CHEMICALNOTIN represents an essential step; in contrast, there is no standardized therapeutic approach for anaplastic tumors and their prognosis is poor. The resistance of anaplastic thyroid cancer to CHEMICALNOTIN treatment is principally due to the absence of expression of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), mainly due to epigenetic silencing. The acetylation status of GENENOTIN is involved in the epigenetic control of gene expression and is usually disrupted in advanced thyroid cancer. GENENOTIN inhibitors have been demonstrated as potent anticancer drugs with several different effects on cell viability and differentiation. Methods: Stabilized anaplastic thyroid cancer cell lines (BHT-101 and CAL-62) and primary cultures from patients who underwent thyroidectomy for anaplastic thyroid cancer were treated with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. After treatment, we evaluated the expression and function of GENENOTIN. Gene expression was evaluated by real-time PCR (RT-PCR); GENENOTIN activity was determined with a luciferase reporter assay; and protein expression was assessed through immunofluorescence. We tested the protein function by CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and efflux experiments; finally the cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was determined with a clonogenic assay. Results: Our results demonstrate that treatment with CHEMICALIN leads to GENEIN RNA expression as shown by RT-PCR and luciferase assay, and to protein expression as determined by immunofluorescence in vitro and by immunohistochemistry in xenograft tumors. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and efflux experiments show the correct protein function and CHEMICALNOTIN retention, that translate into cytotoxicity effects, as demonstrated by a clonogenic assay with CHEMICALNOTIN . Conclusions: This study supplies a new potential strategy for the treatment of ATC by modifying gene expression with the aim of inducing responsiveness towards CHEMICALNOTIN therapy.
23165754	EphB4 enhances the process of endochondral ossification and inhibits remodeling during bone fracture repair. Previous reports have identified a role for the tyrosine kinase receptor EphB4 and its ligand, ephrinB2, as potential mediators of both bone formation by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. In the present study, we examined the role of EphB4 during bone repair after traumatic injury. We performed femoral fractures with internal fixation in transgenic mice that overexpress EphB4 under the collagen type 1 promoter (Col1-EphB4) and investigated the bone repair process up to 12 weeks postfracture. The data indicated that Col1-EphB4 mice exhibited stiffer and stronger bones after fracture compared with wild-type mice. The fractured bones of Col1-EphB4 transgenic mice displayed significantly greater tissue and bone volume 2 weeks postfracture compared with that of wild-type mice. These findings correlated with increased chondrogenesis and mineral formation within the callus site at 2 weeks postfracture, as demonstrated by increased safranin O and von Kossa staining, respectively. Interestingly, Col1-EphB4 mice were found to possess significantly greater numbers of clonogenic mesenchymal stromal progenitor cells (CFU-F), with an increased capacity to form mineralized nodules in vitro under osteogenic conditions, when compared with those of the wild-type control mice. Furthermore, Col1-EphB4 mice had significantly lower numbers of TRAP-positive multinucleated osteoclasts within the callus site. Taken together, these observations suggest that EphB4 promotes endochondral ossification while inhibiting osteoclast development during callus formation and may represent a novel drug target for the repair of fractured bones.
23474645	Inverted CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dot light emitting devices with titanium dioxide as an electron-injection contact. We demonstrated the fabrication of inverted CdSe/CdS/ZnS quantum dot light emitting devices (QD-LEDs) using titanium dioxide (TiO2) as an electron-injection layer and investigated the operating mechanism by utilizing different hole-transport materials, 4,4-N,N-dicarbazole-biphenyl (CBP) and 4,4',4''-tris(carbazol-9-yl)-triphenylamine (TCTA). A more efficient device with CBP as the hole-transport layer (HTL) was obtained compared with the TCTA based device. The peak efficiency of 6.70 cd A(-1) for the CBP based device was found to be about 74.5% higher than the TCTA based device (3.84 cd A(-1)). The studies on the time-resolved photoluminescence spectra of the QD-HTL composite structures showed that the energy transfer (ET) efficiencies from the two HTLs to the QD layer were similar and the charge separation between QDs and HTLs could be neglected. The enhancement in the performance of the CBP based device was attributed to the more efficient hole-injection from CBP to QDs.
23393220	Pharmacokinetic Interactions between GENEIN Inhibitor CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and the Impact of GENENOTIN Status. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN or street name "CHEMICALNOTIN") is a newer designer drug belonging to a group of naturally occurring CHEMICALNOTIN. Our recent study has demonstrated that coadministration of GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN (5 mg/kg) increases systemic exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (2 mg/kg) and active metabolite bufotenine. This study is aimed at delineating CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacokinetic (PK) interactions at multiple dose levels, as well as the impact of GENENOTIN that affects CHEMICALNOTIN PK and determines CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN-demethylation to produce CHEMICALNOTIN. Our data revealed that inhibition of GENEIN-mediated metabolic elimination by CHEMICALIN (2, 5, and 15 mg/kg) led to a sharp increase in systemic and cerebral exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (2 and 10 mg/kg) at all dose combinations. A more pronounced effect on CHEMICALNOTIN PK was associated with greater exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN in wild-type mice than GENENOTIN-humanized (Tg-GENENOTIN) mice. CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg/kg) also increased blood and brain CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations that were generally higher in Tg-GENENOTIN mice. Surprisingly, greater CHEMICALNOTIN dose (15 mg/kg) reduced CHEMICALNOTIN levels. The in vivo inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-catalyzed CHEMICALIN formation was confirmed by in vitro study using purified GENEIN. Given these findings, a unified PK model including the inhibition of GENEIN- and GENEIN-catalyzed CHEMICALIN metabolism by CHEMICALIN was developed to describe blood CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN PK profiles in both wild-type and Tg-GENEIN mouse models. This PK model may be further employed to predict CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN PK interactions at various doses, define the impact of GENENOTIN status, and drive CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacodynamics.
23256472	CHEMICALNOTIN microdosing for protein and peptide drug development: GENENOTIN as a case study. BACKGROUND: Microdosing is a technique for studying the behavior of compounds in vivo at 1/100th of the dose of a test substance calculated, based on animal data, to yield a pharmacologic effect. In microdosing, use is made of accelerator MS (AMS). In this study, we investigated whether CHEMICALNOTIN-labeling of proteins with subsequent AMS measurements is a suitable method to perform microdose studies with therapeutic proteins. We used GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a case study. RESULTS: In an animal study with CHEMICALIN-labeled GENEIN in Han-Wistar rats, an increase of CHEMICALNOTIN-GENENOTIN is observed after dose administration. The half-life was found to be 2 and 5.5 h for two different GENENOTIN. These results are in accordance with expected values. CoNCLUSION: Although further research is required, CHEMICALNOTIN-labeling of proteins seems a feasible method for AMS microdose studies with peptide and protein drugs, such as biosimilars.
14505791	Compared pharmacological characteristics in humans of racemic CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, two GENEIN antagonists. The potent GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a racemic mixture of CHEMICALIN (now available under the trademark CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. In this Commentary, we examine some biological properties of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, namely enantioselectivity in pharmacological activity and pharmacokinetic properties, with emphasis on the possibility of racemization, the compared behavior of the two enantiomers, and the potential for interactions with other drugs. Recent data demonstrate that the antihistaminergic activity of the racemate is primarily due to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is rapidly and extensively absorbed, poorly metabolized, and not subject to racemization. Its pharmacokinetic characteristics are comparable after administration alone or in the racemate. Its apparent volume of distribution is smaller than that of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.41 L kg(-1) vs. 0.60 L kg(-1)). Moreover, the non-renal (mostly hepatic) clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN is also significantly lower than that of CHEMICALNOTIN (11.8 mL min(-1) vs. 29.2 mL min(-1)). Our conclusion is that CHEMICALNOTIN is indeed the eutomer of CHEMICALNOTIN. The evidence reviewed here confirms preclinical findings and offers a rationale for the chiral switch from the racemate to CHEMICALNOTIN.
23414235	CHEMICALIN, an Inhibitor of GENEIN Isolated from the Culture Broth of Streptomyces sp. A new inhibitor of GENEIN, CHEMICALIN (1), was isolated from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. MK931-CF8. The molecular structure of 1 was determined by NMR and MS analysis combined with synthesis. Compound 1 showed potent inhibitory activity against GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) GENENOTIN in in vitro enzyme assays, but GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) responded only weakly. Compound 1 is a promising new selective GENENOTIN inhibitor for investigating new treatments of cancer and inflammatory diseases.
15561973	Substrate specificity of the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, under voltage-clamp conditions. Proximal tubule cells extract dicarboxylates from filtrate and blood, using cotransporters located in the brush border [GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)] and basolateral cell membrane (GENENOTIN). We expressed the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in Xenopus laevis oocytes and characterized it by the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. At -60 mV, CHEMICALNOTIN (4 CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (5 CHEMICALNOTIN) generated inward currents due to translocation of three CHEMICALNOTIN ions and one divalent dicarboxylate, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN (2 CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (3 CHEMICALNOTIN) did not. The CHEMICALNOTIN produced currents smaller in magnitude, whereas the CHEMICALNOTIN generated currents similar to CHEMICALNOTIN. The substituted CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN elicited inward currents, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN showed hardly detectable currents. The CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN produced larger currents than CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN failed to cause inward currents. Kinetic analysis revealed, at -60 mV, K(0.5) values of 25 +/- 12 microM for CHEMICALNOTIN and 45 +/- 13 microM for CHEMICALNOTIN, values close to the plasma concentration of these compounds. For both compounds, the K(0.5) was independent of voltage, whereas the maximal current increased with hyperpolarization. As opposed to the rat and flounder orthologs, GENEIN was hardly inhibited by CHEMICALIN concentrations up to 5 mM. In the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN, however, CHEMICALNOTIN can mediate CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent currents. The narrow substrate specificity prevents interaction of drugs with dicarboxylate-like structure with GENENOTIN and ensures sufficient support of the proximal tubule cells with CHEMICALIN for anion secretion via GENEIN.
15866288	Effects of inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN in the cornea and tear fluid of eyes irradiated with UVB. The purpose of the present study was to test our hypothesis that CHEMICALIN, a specific GENEIN inhibitor, effectively decreases GENEIN activity in cornea as well as in tear fluid and favourably affects corneal healing. Therefore, comparative histochemical and biochemical studies of GENEIN and the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were performed on rabbit corneas and tear fluid using the sensitive fluorogenic substrate CHEMICALIN. Rabbit eyes were repeatedly irradiated with UVB for 9 days and during the irradiation topically treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (1 mg/ml saline) or placebo (saline) (dropwise, 5 times daily). Results show that in placebo-treated eyes, UVB evoked the appearance of GENENOTIN activity in cornea and tear fluid in early stages of irradiation, and GENENOTIN levels increased during irradiation. Corneal epithelium was gradually lost and remnants of the epithelium as well as keratocytes in the upper part of corneal stroma showed high GENENOTIN activity. Finally, corneas lost their epithelium completely. In corneal stroma, numerous GENENOTIN-containing inflammatory cells were present. Corneas were vascularized. When CHEMICALIN was dropped on the eye surface on the first day of irradiation and subsequently daily until the end of the experiment, GENEIN activity in both cornea and tear fluid was strongly inhibited. Corneas were covered with a continuous epithelium until the end of the experiment. The number of inflammatory cells was significantly decreased. Corneal vascularization was reduced by 50%. In conclusion, early application of CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN activity in UVB-irradiated corneas as well as in tear fluid and diminished the development of corneal pathology.
20427668	Rapid GENENOTIN-mediated inhibition of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal ultradian activity in healthy males. A complex dynamic ultradian rhythm underlies the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) circadian rhythm. We have investigated in normal human male subjects the importance, site of action, and receptor-mediated processes involved in rapid basal CHEMICALIN feedback and its interaction with GENEIN (GENEIN) drive. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), ACTH, and cortisol were measured every 10 min from healthy males during the awakening period or late afternoon using an automated blood sampling system. Mathematical modeling into discrete pulses of activity revealed that intravenous infusion of the synthetic mixed glucocorticoid/mineralocorticoid agonist CHEMICALNOTIN produced rapid inhibition of ACTH and CHEMICALNOTIN pulsatility within 30 min in the morning and afternoon. Any pulse that had commenced at the time of injection was unaffected, and subsequent pulsatility was inhibited. CHEMICALIN also inhibited ACTH and CHEMICALIN secretion in response to exogenous GENEIN stimulation, inferring rapid feedback inhibition at the anterior pituitary. Circulating GENEIN peptide concentrations were unaffected, suggesting that the rapid CHEMICALIN inhibitory effect specifically targeted ACTH secretion from pituitary corticotrophs. CHEMICALIN fast feedback was only reduced by GENEIN antagonist pretreatment and not by GENEIN antagonism, suggesting a GENEIN-mediated pathway. The intravenous CHEMICALNOTIN suppression test provides a powerful new tool to investigate HPA abnormalities underlying metabolic and psychiatric disease states.
3299141	Localization of L-glutamate decarboxylase and GABA transaminase immunoreactivity in the sympathetic ganglia of the rat. The location of L-glutamate decarboxylase and gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA)-transaminase immunoreactivity in the superior cervical ganglion and in the coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex of the rat was studied by an indirect immunofluorescence method and by immunoelectron microscopy, with specific antisera raised in rabbits against the corresponding enzymes. In light microscopy, several glutamate decarboxylase- or GABA-transaminase-immunoreactive principal nerve cells were detected in the superior cervical ganglion and coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex. In addition, numerous small cells in both the superior cervical ganglion and coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex showed intense immunoreactivity to glutamate decarboxylase or GABA-transaminase. The small cells were 10-20 micron in diameter and resembled in size and morphology the small intensely fluorescent cells. In consecutive sections, the small glutamate decarboxylase-immunoreactive cell clusters also showed immunoreactivity to tyrosine hydroxylase, suggesting that these cells contain the enzymes for both GABA and catecholamine synthesis. In the superior cervical ganglion and in the coeliac-superior mesenteric ganglion complex, GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was also localized in fibre-like processes around and between the principal nerve cells, in nerve trunks traversing the ganglia, and around or in close contact with ganglionic blood vessels. Furthermore, GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was observed in fibre-like structures close to the capsule of the ganglia. Division of the preganglionic nerve trunk of the superior cervical ganglion caused no detectable change in GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity in the ganglion. In immunoelectron microscopy of the superior cervical ganglion, GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was localized in nerve fibres in association with neurotubules. A large number of GABA-transaminase labelled principal nerve cells were detected, containing immunoreactivity evenly distributed in their cytoplasm. GABA-transaminase immunoreactivity was also observed in satellite cells and their processes in the superior cervical ganglion. The present immunocytochemical results provide evidence that the rat sympathetic ganglia contain an intrinsic neuronal system showing histochemical markers for GABA synthesis and inactivation, but its functional role in the modulation of ganglionic neurotransmission remains to be established.
25136065	Albiglutide: a new GLP-1 receptor agonist for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of albiglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in type 2 diabetes (T2D). DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1950-June 2014) was conducted using the keyword albiglutide. References were reviewed to identify additional sources. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles evaluating pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, or efficacy of albiglutide were included. DATA SYNTHESIS: Albiglutide is a long-acting GLP-1 RA that lowers glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) and reduces weight by stimulating glucose-dependent insulin secretion, suppressing glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and promoting satiety. Albiglutide has a long half-life as a result of resistance to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and fusion to albumin, thus allowing once-weekly dosing. Albiglutide has been studied as monotherapy and add-on therapy to metformin, sulfonylureas, thiazolidinediones, insulin glargine, and varying combinations of these agents. Clinical studies have shown albiglutide to be superior to placebo, sitagliptin, and glimepiride and noninferior to insulin glargine and insulin lispro at reducing A1C in T2D patients, with A1C changes from baseline ranging from -0.55% to -0.9%. Noninferiority was not achieved when compared to liraglutide and pioglitazone. Weight changes ranged from +0.28 to -1.21 kg. The most common side effects are upper-respiratory-tract infections, diarrhea, nausea, and injection-site reactions. CONCLUSION: Albiglutide is the fourth GLP-1 RA approved in the United States. Advantages include once-weekly dosing and fewer gastrointestinal side effects compared with liraglutide, but it is less effective at reducing A1C and weight compared to liraglutide. It has not been compared head to head with other GLP-1 RAs.
23177256	Pharmacophore identification of GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. A structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of the GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, 1) - which targets a hydrophobic domain of the GENEIN oncoprotein that is flanked by CHEMICALIN residues - was executed in order to determine its pharmacophore. Whilst the CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be critical for inhibitory activity, the CHEMICALNOTIN could be replaced with a CHEMICALNOTIN group to furnish the new inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN (3q). Around five times as potent as the lead with an IC(50) of 33 Î¼M for disruption of the GENEIN-GENEIN heterodimer, CHEMICALIN demonstrated excellent selectivity over GENEIN-GENEIN homodimers, with no apparent effect at 100 Î¼M. Importantly, the carboxylic acid of CHEMICALIN improves the physicochemical properties of the lead compound, which will facilitate the incorporation of additional hydrophobicity that might enhance GENEIN inhibitory activity further still.
17603755	Treatment of Niemann-Pick disease type C in two children with CHEMICALNOTIN: initial responses and maintenance of effects over 1 year. Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C) is a lipid storage disorder characterized by the accumulation of unesterified CHEMICALNOTIN and glycolipids in the lysosomal/late endosomal system of certain cells in the central nervous system (CNS) and visceral organs. Clinical symptoms include progressive neurological deterioration and visceral organomegaly. CHEMICALIN, a small iminosugar molecule approved for the treatment of Gaucher disease, reversibly inhibits GENEIN, which catalyses the first committed step in glycosphingolipid synthesis. The physicochemical properties of miglustat allow it to cross the blood-brain barrier and suggest possible benefits in lysosomal storage diseases affecting the CNS. Here, we present findings in two children with NP-C, aged 14 years (patient 1) and 9 years (patient 2), treated with CHEMICALNOTIN for 1 year. Before treatment, patient 1 presented with severe difficulties in swallowing and walking, and patient 2 with problems mostly affecting communication and social interaction. Videofluoroscopic studies in patient 1 demonstrated a substantial improvement in swallowing by month 6 of treatment, and ambulation index measurements indicated improved walking. Mini Mental-State Examination (MMSE) assessments in patient 2 showed cognitive improvement by month 6, which was sustained up to month 12. Liver/spleen volume and plasma GENENOTIN activities were stabilized in both cases. There was no weight loss during treatment. Patient 1 experienced severe but self-limiting paresthesia, which was not associated with peripheral neuropathy. We conclude that CHEMICALNOTIN can provide therapeutic benefits in CNS symptoms and allows stabilization of systemic disease in childhood-onset NP-C. Further follow-up is crucial to determine the long-term maintenance of these effects.
23270965	CHEMICALIN induces atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability in GENEIN-knockout mice. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is the major electrophilic metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a natural plant constituent found in essential oils of numerous edible herbs and spices and in food containing these herbs, such as pesto sauce, cola beverages and bologna sausages. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in mammalian systems, especially the cardiovascular system, are little known. Disruption of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaques in atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease, is the main cause of cardiovascular events. In this study, we investigated CHEMICALIN-induced atherosclerotic plaque vulnerability (possibility of rupture) in GENEIN-knockout (GENEIN(-/-)) mice. Lipid area in vessel wall reached 59.8% in high dose CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN-HD) treated group, which is only 31.2% in control group. CHEMICALNOTIN treatment changed the lesion composition to an unstable phenotype, increased the number of apoptotic cells in plaque and the endothelium in plaques was damaged after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Furthermore, compared with control groups, the plaque endothelium level of GENEIN was 3-fold increased and the liver level of GENEIN was 17.4-fold increased by CHEMICALIN-HD. Meanwhile, the serum level of KC (a functional homolog of GENEIN and the main proinflammatory GENEIN in mice) in GENEIN(-/-) mice was up to 357pg/ml in CHEMICALIN-HD treated group. Thus, CHEMICALIN contributes to the instability of atherosclerotic plaque in GENEIN(-/-) mice through activating GENEIN and GENEIN and cell apoptosis in plaque.
9633680	Mechanism of action of dopaminergic agents in Parkinson's disease. As the substantia nigra degenerates in Parkinson's disease (PD), the nigrostriatal pathway is disrupted, reducing striatal CHEMICALNOTIN and producing PD symptoms. Although CHEMICALNOTIN does not readily cross the blood-brain barrier, its precursor, CHEMICALNOTIN, does. CHEMICALIN is absorbed in the small bowel and is rapidly catabolized by GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). Because gastric GENEIN and GENEIN degrade CHEMICALIN, the drug is given with inhibitors of GENEIN (CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN), and inhibitors of GENENOTIN will also enter clinical use. Although the exact site of decarboxylation of exogenous CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN in the brain is unknown, most striatal GENENOTIN is located in nigrostriatal dopaminergic nerve terminals. Newly synthesized dopamine is stored in the terminals and then released, stimulating postsynaptic GENENOTIN and mediating the antiparkinsonian action of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN agonists act directly on postsynaptic GENENOTIN, thus obviating the need for metabolic conversion, storage, and release. How the actions of dopaminergic drugs produce side effects and how these side effects should be managed are discussed.
16636450	Soy protein suppresses gene expression of GENENOTIN from GENENOTIN in rat liver. Dietary soy protein isolate (SPI) reduces hepatic lipogenesis by suppressing gene expression of lipogenic enzymes, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). In order to elucidate the mechanism of this regulation, the effect of dietary SPI on GENENOTIN specific gene expression of GENENOTIN was investigated. Rats were fed experimental diets containing SPI or GENEIN as a CHEMICALIN source. SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of total GENENOTIN mRNA as well as CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) content, but dietary SPI affected the amount of GENENOTIN mRNA and protein very little. The amount of GENENOTIN mRNA transcribed from GENENOTIN containing GENENOTIN was not significantly affected by dietary protein, while a significant decrease in GENENOTIN-generated GENENOTIN mRNA content was observed in rats fed the SPI diet. These data suggest that SPI feeding decreased the hepatic contents of GENENOTIN mRNA mainly by regulating GENENOTIN via a nuclear factor(s) other than GENENOTIN.
23199882	Polymethoxyflavones as agents that prevent formation of cataract: nobiletin congeners show potent growth inhibitory effects in human lens epithelial cells. Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) is the most frequent complication and the primary reason for visual decrease after extracapsular cataract surgery. The proliferation and migration of leftover lens epithelial cells (LECs) after surgery may contribute to the development of PCO. To prevent PCO, a rational approach would be to inhibit both the proliferation and the migration of LECs using nontoxic xenobiotics. Nobiletin, one of the most abundant polymethoxyflavones (PMFs) in citrus peel, and its synthetic congeners displayed a potent inhibition of LEC proliferation. Structural features which enhance anti-proliferative activity have also been discussed.
23194532	The in vivo antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of green tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae). The in vivo antioxidant and antifibrotic properties of green tea (Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) were investigated with a study of carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4))-induced oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis in male ICR mice. Oral administration of green tea extract at doses of 125, 625 and 1250 mg/kg for 8 weeks significantly reduced (p<0.05) the levels of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS) and protein carbonyls in the liver by at least 28% compared with that was induced by CCl(4) (1 mL/kg) in mice. Moreover, green tea extract administration significantly increased (p<0.05) the activities of catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) and glutathione reductase (GSH-Rd) in the liver. Our study found that oral administration of green tea extract prevented CCl(4)-induced hepatic fibrosis, as evidenced by a decreased hydroxyproline level in the liver and a reduced incidence of hepatic fibrosis by histological observations. These results indicate that green tea exhibits potent protective effects against CCl(4)-induced oxidative stress and hepatic fibrosis in mice by inhibiting oxidative damage and increasing antioxidant enzyme activities.
11732752	Comparison of GENENOTIN enzymatic activities in various animals and in humans. The specific enzymatic activity of four different GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) in vaginal homogenates from rabbit, rat, guinea-pig, sheep and humans was compared. The purpose of the study was to find an appropriate animal model that can be used in degradation studies of protein and peptide drugs. Different substrates were used as the relative specific substrates for the determination of GENENOTIN enzymatic activity: CHEMICALIN of CHEMICALIN for GENEIN, CHEMICALIN of CHEMICALIN for GENEIN, CHEMICALIN of CHEMICALIN for GENEIN and CHEMICALIN of CHEMICALIN for GENEIN. The GENENOTIN enzymatic activity of different species was determined spectrofluorometrically. The inhibition of GENEIN activity in the presence of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibitors was also investigated. The results showed the presence of GENENOTIN enzymatic activity in all vaginal homogenates in the order: sheep > guinea-pig > rabbit > or = human > or = rat. Based on the results of the hydrolysis and inhibition of the CHEMICALNOTIN substrates, it was difficult to have an exact decision on the GENENOTIN type in the vaginal homogenates from the species studied. It was found that the GENENOTIN activity in rat, rabbit and humans was not statistically different. Therefore, we suggest that rats and rabbits could be used as model animals for vaginal enzymatic activity studies and for determination of the degradation of protein and peptide drugs in the vagina.
23522835	In silico identification of poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 inhibitors and their chemosensitizing effects against cisplatin-resistant human gastric cancer cells. Poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase-1 (PARP-1) enzyme is involved in the repair of DNA damages made by certain anticancer agents. It is suggested that PARP-1 inhibitors potentiate the cytotoxic effects and circumvent the resistance of DNA-modifying anticancer agents such as cisplatin. In this study, we conducted virtual screening of Korea Chemical Bank database targeting PARP-1 and identified several potent PARP-1 inhibitors with submicromolar IC50 values (77-79nM). We then examined the chemosensitization of cisplatin by pre-treatment of PARP-1 inhibitors in cisplatin-resistant human gastric cancer cells. Our results show that PARP-1 inhibitors suppress the formation of poly(ADP-ribose) and enhance the cytotoxicity of cisplatin.
23231502	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a target for modification by lipid electrophiles. Oxidation of membrane phospholipids is associated with inflammation, neurodegenerative disease, and cancer. Oxyradical damage to phospholipids results in the production of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN that adduct proteins and modulate their function. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a common product of oxidative damage to lipids, adducts proteins at exposed CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN residues. Here, we demonstrate that GENEIN (GENEIN), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of the peptide bond of CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN moieties in signaling proteins from cis to trans, is highly susceptible to CHEMICALIN modification. Incubation of purified GENEIN with CHEMICALNOTIN followed by MALDI-TOF/TOF mass spectrometry resulted in detection of Michael adducts at the active site residues CHEMICALIN-157 and CHEMICALIN-113. Time and concentration dependencies indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN-113 is the primary site of CHEMICALNOTIN modification. GENEIN was adducted in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells treated with CHEMICALIN as judged by click chemistry conjugation with CHEMICALNOTIN followed by streptavidin-based pulldown and Western blotting with anti-GENENOTIN antibody. Furthermore, orbitrap MS data support the adduction of CHEMICALIN-113 in the GENEIN active site upon CHEMICALIN treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells. siRNA knockdown of GENENOTIN in MDA-MB-231 cells partially protected the cells from CHEMICALNOTIN-induced toxicity. Recent studies indicate that GENEIN is an important molecular target for the chemopreventive effects of green tea CHEMICALIN. The present study establishes that it is also a target for electrophilic modification by products of lipid peroxidation.
16484281	Withdrawal from free-choice CHEMICALIN consumption results in increased packing density of GENEIN-immunoreactive astrocytes in the prelimbic cortex of CHEMICALNOTIN-preferring rats. Excess activation of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the cerebral cortex following CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal is considered to contribute to significant behavioural disturbances, and to CHEMICALNOTIN craving. Astrocytes may play a role in these manifestations because astrocytes are essential in the regulation of released CHEMICALIN and its conversion to CHEMICALIN through the enzyme GENEIN (GENEIN). However, it is unclear if withdrawal from free-choice CHEMICALNOTIN drinking causes changes in the numbers of astrocytes expressing GENENOTIN or the cytoskeletal protein of astrocytes GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN-preferring (P) rats exposed to free-choice CHEMICALNOTIN drinking were either maintained without forced interruption of CHEMICALNOTIN drinking, subjected to a 3-day withdrawal period at the end of 2 months, or subjected to three 3-day withdrawal periods along 6 months. At 2 months, P rats were also compared with CHEMICALNOTIN-naive CHEMICALNOTIN non-preferring rats (NP) rats. Packing density of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN-immunoreactive (IR) astrocytes was measured in sections from the prelimbic cortex (PLC) using the optical disector probe. An CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation effect was observed in P rats with withdrawals during a 6-month ethanol drinking period. CHEMICALIN withdrawal significantly increased the packing density of GENEIN- and GENEIN-IR astrocytes in the PLC of P rats as compared with P rats with continuous access to ethanol. In addition, there was a positive correlation between the pre-withdrawal CHEMICALIN consumption and the packing density of GENEIN-IR astrocytes. The present results suggest the involvement of astrocytes in the regulation of the glutamatergic activation associated with withdrawal from free-choice CHEMICALIN consumption and point to differential adaptations of GENEIN and GENEIN to prolonged CHEMICALNOTIN drinking in the PLC of P rats.
23274887	Fetal PGC-1Î± overexpression programs adult pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction. Adult Î²-cell dysfunction, a hallmark of type 2 diabetes, can be programmed by adverse fetal environment. We have shown that fetal glucocorticoids (GCs) participate in this programming through inhibition of Î²-cell development. Here we have investigated the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation. We showed that GCs stimulate the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-Î³ coactivator-1Î± (PGC-1Î±), a coregulator of the GCs receptor (GR), and that the overexpression of PGC-1Î± represses genes important for Î²-cell development and function. More precisely, PGC-1Î± inhibited the expression of the key Î²-cell transcription factor pancreatic duodenal homeobox 1 (Pdx1). This repression required the GR and was mediated through binding of a GR/PGC-1Î± complex to the Pdx1 promoter. To explore PGC-1Î± function, we generated mice with inducible Î²-cell PGC-1Î± overexpression. Mice overexpressing PGC-1Î± exhibited at adult age impaired glucose tolerance associated with reduced insulin secretion, decreased Î²-cell mass, and Î²-cell hypotrophy. Interestingly, PGC-1Î± expression in fetal life only was sufficient to impair adult Î²-cell function whereas Î²-cell PGC-1Î± overexpression from adult age had no consequence on Î²-cell function. Altogether, our results demonstrate that the GR and PGC-1Î± participate in the fetal programming of adult Î²-cell function through inhibition of Pdx1 expression.
23221868	CHEMICALIN attenuates mechanical allodynia in a model of neuropathic pain in the mouse and stabilizes GENEIN inactivated state. BACKGROUND: GENENOTIN dysregulation is important for hyperexcitability leading to pain persistence. GENENOTIN blockers currently used to treat neuropathic pain are poorly tolerated. Getting new molecules to clinical use is laborious. We here propose a drug already marketed as anticonvulsant, CHEMICALNOTIN. METHODS: We compared the behavioral effect of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN using the Spared Nerve Injury neuropathic pain model in mice. We compared the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN currents using in vitro patch clamp in cells expressing the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN isoform and on dissociated dorsal root ganglion neurons to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. RESULTS: In naive mice, CHEMICALNOTIN (20 mg/kg) increased withdrawal threshold to mechanical stimulation from 1.3 (0.6-1.9) (median [95% CI]) to 2.3 g (2.2-2.5) and latency of withdrawal to heat stimulation from 13.1 (10.4-15.5) to 30.0 s (21.8-31.9), whereas CHEMICALNOTIN had no effect. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN alleviated injury-induced mechanical allodynia for 4 h (maximal effect: 0.10 +/- 0.03 g (mean +/- SD) to 1.99 +/- 0.26 g for CHEMICALNOTIN and 0.25 +/- 0.22 g to 1.92 +/- 0.85 g for CHEMICALNOTIN). All drugs reduced peak current and stabilized the inactivated state of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, with similar effects in dorsal root ganglion neurons. CONCLUSIONS: At doses alleviating neuropathic pain, CHEMICALNOTIN showed alteration of behavioral response possibly related to either alteration of basal pain sensitivity or sedative effect or both. Side-effects and drug tolerance/compliance are major problems with drugs such as CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN seems to have a better tolerability profile and could be a new alternative to explore for the treatment of neuropathic pain.
23298258	CHEMICALIN protects hepatocellular carcinoma cells against serum-starvation-induced cell death by upregulating GENEIN. As a therapeutic or chemopreventative agent for various cancers, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been reported to inhibit growth, induce apoptosis or cause differentiation. It was found that CHEMICALNOTIN could protect hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells against cell death induced by serum starvation. Furthermore, it was found that CHEMICALNOTIN could enhance cell adhesion, but had no effect on the cell cycle and apoptosis. Using an Illumina Human HT-12 v4 expression microarray, 207 upregulated and 173 downregulated genes were identified in HepG2 cells treated with CHEMICALNOTIN. The most upregulated genes are GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which showed more than fivefold greater expression. Using Gene Ontology analysis, the greatest significance was found in extracellular-matrix-related molecular functions and the cellular component in upregulated genes. The upregulation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was further confirmed using quantitative RT-PCR and western blotting. Knockdown of GENENOTIN blocked enhancement in the early stage of cell adhesion by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Re-expression of GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN-knocked-down HCC cells reversed the effect of small interfering RNA-GENENOTIN. In addition, GENENOTIN could increase HCC cell migration and invasion. Thus, GENEIN was identified as the key protein involved in the enhancement of cell adhesion of CHEMICALIN under serum-free conditions. In conclusion, CHEMICALNOTIN protects HCC cells against serum-starvation-induced cell death by enhancing cell adhesion, and GENENOTIN plays an important role in HCC cell migration and invasion.
12699699	Cloning and expression of a GENENOTIN from the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The GENENOTIN gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae does not show significant sequence identity to any known gene, except for GENENOTIN (22% to GENENOTIN). The GENENOTIN was cloned and overexpressed in both Escherichia coli and S. cerevisiae. Both expression systems yielded proteins that bound heme tightly. The isolated GENENOTIN protein underwent reduction in the presence of either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN but did not exhibit GENENOTIN activity. The protein exhibited modest CHEMICALIN-dependent GENEIN activities with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Thus, GENENOTIN codes for a GENENOTIN of unknown physiological function that exhibits GENENOTIN activity.
23435367	Transcriptional regulation of GENENOTIN in ovarian granulosa cells. GENEIN (GENEIN; GENEIN) is an CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN protein that is involved in various metabolic processes, including CHEMICALIN synthesis in mammalian tissues. We investigated the transcriptional regulation of GENENOTIN in ovarian granulosa cells. Previously, we reported that the GENENOTIN family, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN could induce differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) into steroidogenic cells. A ChIP assay showed that GENENOTIN could bind to the GENENOTIN in differentiated hMSCs. Luciferase reporter assays showed that transcription of GENEIN was synergistically activated by the GENENOTIN family and CHEMICALIN treatment through two GENEIN binding sites and a GENENOTIN-like sequence in a human ovarian granulosa cell line, KGN. Knockdown of GENENOTIN attenuated CHEMICALNOTIN production in KGN cells. These results indicate transcription of GENEIN is regulated by the GENENOTIN family and CHEMICALIN signaling, and participates in CHEMICALIN hormone production in ovarian granulosa cells.
10752671	Evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN genotoxicity in rats and in primary human hepatocytes. CHEMICALIN, an effective competitive inhibitor of the GENEIN used orally for palliative treatment of prostatic carcinoma and regulation of prostatic hyperplasia was evaluated for its genotoxic effects in the intact rat and in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. Negative responses were obtained in all the in vivo assays as well as in the in vitro assay. In rats given a single oral dose of 500 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN, fragmentation and repair of liver DNA were absent, and no increase was observed in the frequency of micronucleated hepatocytes. In the liver of rats given CHEMICALIN as initiating agent at the dose of 500 mg/kg/week for 6 successive weeks, GENEIN-positive foci were detected only in 3 of 10 rats. There was no evidence of a promoting effect on the development of aberrant crypt foci in rats given 100 mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN on alternate days for 8 successive weeks. In primary cultures of human hepatocytes from one male and one female donor DNA fragmentation as measured by the Comet assays, and DNA repair synthesis as revealed by quantitative autoradiography, were absent after a 20 hr exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations ranging from 18 to 56 microM. Taken as a whole, our results seem to indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN is a non-genotoxic drug.
22874922	Novel non-canonical TGF-Î² signaling networks: emerging roles in airway smooth muscle phenotype and function. The airway smooth muscle (ASM) plays an important role in the pathophysiology of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). ASM cells express a wide range of receptors involved in contraction, growth, matrix protein production and the secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-Î²) is one of the major players in determining the structural and functional abnormalities of the ASM in asthma and COPD. It is increasingly evident that TGF-Î² functions as a master switch, controlling a network of intracellular and autocrine signaling loops that effect ASM phenotype and function. In this review, the various elements that participate in non-canonical TGF-Î² signaling, including MAPK, PI3K, WNT/Î²-catenin, and Ca(2+), are discussed, focusing on their effect on ASM phenotype and function. In addition, new aspects of ASM biology and their possible association with non-canonical TGF-Î² signaling will be discussed.
23542126	Oxidative status in ICU patients with septic shock. The aim of this pilot study was to investigate variability of oxidative stress during sepsis evolution. ICU patients with the diagnosis of septic shock were included. Thiobarbituric-acid reactive substances, total antioxidant capacity, protein carbonyls in plasma, reduced, oxidized glutathione and catalase activity in erythrocyte lysate were assessed in the 1st, 3rd, 5th and 8thday after sepsis appearance. A total of 17 patients were divided in two groups: survivors (n=7) and non-survivors (n=10). APACHE II was 11.5Â±5.4 and 19.9Â±4.97 in survivors and non-survivors respectively (p=0.005), while mean age and SOFA score at sepsis diagnosis, were similar between the two groups. GSH levels, catalase activity and protein carbonyls presented significant different course in time between survivors and non-survivors (p<0.05). Catalase activity was significantly higher in survivors (238.8Â±51.5) than non-survivors (166.4Â±40.2; p=0.005), while protein carbonyls levels were significantly lower in survivors (0.32Â±0.09) than non-survivors (0.48Â±0.16; p=0.036) on the 1stday. Yet, non-survivors exhibited a declining course in GSH levels during time, while GSH levels were maintained in survivors. Conclusively, a longstanding antioxidant deficiency in non-surviving patients was noted. This phenomenon was clearly prominent in patients' erythrocytes.
23439561	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN Mediate Acid-Induced GENENOTIN Expression in Barrett's Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Cells. The mechanisms of progression from Barrett's esophagus (BE) to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) are not known. GENEIN (GENEIN)-derived CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) has been shown to be important in esophageal tumorigenesis. We have shown that GENEIN mediates acid-induced CHEMICALIN production. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) responsible for acid-induced CHEMICALNOTIN production in BE, however, is not known. We found that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were present in FLO EA cells. Pulsed acid treatment significantly increased GENENOTIN mRNA and protein levels but had little or no effect on GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN mRNA. Knockdown of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN small interfering RNA (siRNA) blocked acid-induced increase in CHEMICALNOTIN production and CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation. Knockdown of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, a variant lacking GENENOTIN, by GENENOTIN siRNA significantly inhibited acid-induced increase in GENENOTIN expression, CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation, and CHEMICALNOTIN production. Overexpression of GENENOTIN significantly increased the luciferase activity in FLO cells transfected with a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in vivo activation reporter plasmid pGENENOTIN-Luc. Knockdown of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN siRNA significantly decreased acid-induced increase in GENENOTIN expression, CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation, and CHEMICALNOTIN production. Two novel GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, were identified in the GENENOTIN. We conclude that GENEIN mediates acid-induced increase in CHEMICALIN production and cell proliferation. Acid-induced GENENOTIN expression depends on activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN may be a potential target to prevent or treat EA.
23318726	CHEMICALIN protects human dental pulp cells from CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative toxicity via GENEIN pathway-dependent GENEIN expressions. Rhus verniciflua Stokes is a plant that is native to East Asian countries, such as Korea, China, and Japan. CHEMICALNOTIN, a plant CHEMICALNOTIN, is one of the major active components of R. verniciflua. Reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS), produced via dental adhesive bleaching agents and pulpal disease, can cause oxidative stress. Here, we found that CHEMICALNOTIN possesses cytoprotective effects on CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced dental cell death. CHEMICALNOTIN is a representative ROS and causes cell death through necrosis in human dental pulp (HDP) cells. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cytotoxicity and production of ROS were blocked in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, and these effects were dose dependent. CHEMICALIN also increased GENEIN (GENEIN) protein expression and GENEIN activity. In addition, CHEMICALIN-dependent GENEIN expression was required for the inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cell death and ROS generation. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN treatment caused nuclear accumulation of GENEIN (GENEIN) and increased the promoter activity of GENEIN (GENEIN). Treatment of HDP cells with a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitor also reduced CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN expression, and CHEMICALIN treatment led to increased GENEIN phosphorylation. These results indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN may be used to prevent functional dental cell death and thus may be useful as a pulpal disease agent.
7986344	Folding pathway of CHEMICALNOTIN-denatured CHEMICALIN-intact wild-type and mutant GENEIN. The refolding kinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN-denatured CHEMICALIN-intact GENEIN (GENEIN) and its GENEIN mutant (GENEIN) have been studied by monitoring CHEMICALNOTIN burial and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) inhibitor binding. The folding rate for wild-type GENEIN is faster in the presence of the inhibitor CHEMICALIN than in its absence, indicating that the transition-state structure in the rate-determining step is stabilized by CHEMICALIN. The folding rate monitored by CHEMICALIN binding to the major slow-folding species of GENEIN GENEIN is faster than the folding rate monitored by CHEMICALIN burial; however, the folding rate monitored by inhibitor binding to the minor slow-folding species is decreased significantly over the folding rate monitored by CHEMICALIN burial, indicating that the major and minor slow-folding species of GENENOTIN fold to the native state with different transition-state conformations in the rate-determining step.
23592839	Nutrient signaling in protein homeostasis: an increase in quantity at the expense of quality. The discovery that rapamycin extends the life span of diverse organisms has triggered many studies aimed at identifying the underlying molecular mechanisms. Mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) regulates cell growth and may regulate organismal aging by controlling mRNA translation. However, how inhibiting mTORC1 and decreasing protein synthesis can extend life span remains an unresolved issue. We showed that constitutively active mTORC1 signaling increased general protein synthesis but unexpectedly reduced the quality of newly synthesized polypeptides. We demonstrated that constitutively active mTORC1 decreased translation fidelity by increasing the speed of ribosomal elongation. Conversely, rapamycin treatment restored the quality of newly synthesized polypeptides mainly by slowing the rate of ribosomal elongation. We also found distinct roles for mTORC1 downstream targets in maintaining protein homeostasis. Loss of S6 kinases, but not 4E-BP family proteins, which are both involved in regulation of translation, attenuated the effects of rapamycin on the quality of newly translated proteins. Our results reveal a mechanistic connection between mTORC1 and protein quality, highlighting the central role of nutrient signaling in growth and aging.
23264615	CHEMICALNOTIN and interferon tau regulation of endometrial function and conceptus development in female sheep. During early pregnancy in sheep, the elongating conceptus secretes GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and the conceptus as well as endometrial epithelia produce CHEMICALIN (PG) via GENEIN (GENEIN) and CHEMICALIN via GENEIN (GENEIN). Ovarian CHEMICALNOTIN induces and PG and GENENOTIN stimulates endometrial GENENOTIN expression and GENENOTIN activity as well as many epithelial genes that govern trophectoderm proliferation, migration, and attachment during elongation. The primary aim of these studies was to test the hypothesis that GENEIN-derived CHEMICALIN has a biological role in endometrial function and conceptus development during early pregnancy in sheep. In study 1, cyclic ewes received vehicle, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALIN (PF; a selective inhibitor of GENEIN), CHEMICALNOTIN and PF, CHEMICALIN (a selective inhibitor of GENEIN), CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, recombinant GENENOTIN, or GENENOTIN and PF into the uterus from day 10 to day14 after estrus. CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN stimulated endometrial GENEIN expression and activity, increased endometrial GENEIN activity and the amount of PG in the uterine lumen, and up-regulated many conceptus elongation-related genes in the endometrium. Some effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN were mediated by GENENOTIN-derived PG. In study 2, bred ewes received CHEMICALNOTIN or recombinant GENENOTIN and into the uterus from day 10 to day 14 after mating. Inhibition of GENENOTIN activity in utero prevented conceptus elongation, whereas GENENOTIN rescued conceptus elongation in PF-infused ewes. These results suggest that GENEIN-derived CHEMICALIN mediates, in part, actions of ovarian CHEMICALNOTIN and the conceptus on endometrial function and support the hypothesis that GENENOTIN, PG, and CHEMICALNOTIN coordinately regulate endometrial functions important for conceptus elongation and implantation during early pregnancy in sheep.
7944828	CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN): a novel agonist at GENEIN in the canine basilar artery. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms involved in the contractile effects produced by the novel CHEMICALNOTIN derivative, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), in the canine isolated basilar artery. For comparison, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were also evaluated on rat aorta. Canine basilar artery and rat aortic rings were prepared and mounted in organ baths to record isometric tension changes. The contractile effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in the basilar artery were compared with those produced by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and the GENENOTIN agonist CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN (10(-10)-10(-6)M), CHEMICALNOTIN (3.1 x 10(-8)-10(-4) M) and CHEMICALNOTIN (3.1 x 10(-7)-10(-4) M) each caused concentration-dependent contractions of the canine basilar artery with a rank order of agonist potency of CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN exhibited similar maximum effects which were higher than that of CHEMICALNOTIN. Similar concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN failed to produce contraction in rat aorta. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in the basilar artery were not modified by incubation with either the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (0.01-1 microM), the GENEIN and GENEIN receptor antagonist ICS205930 (CHEMICALIN; 0.1-10 microM), the GENEIN receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN (0.01-1 microM), the GENEIN blocker with high affinity for GENEIN and GENEIN binding sites CHEMICALIN (0.01-1 microM), or the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (0.01-1 microM). In contrast, the CHEMICALIN-induced responses were potently and concentration-dependently antagonized by the mixed GENEIN and GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (0.01-1 microM). It is concluded that CHEMICALIN contracts the canine basilar artery by stimulating GENEIN unrelated to either the GENEIN or GENEIN receptor subtypes. The compound seems to be devoid of GENENOTIN agonist properties in rat aorta.
23229512	CHEMICALIN covalently binds to GENEIN and induces GENEIN-mediated apoptosis. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) is known to have anticancer activity in vitro and in vivo. Although its effect is thought to be mediated, at least in part, by the induction of apoptosis, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we identified GENENOTIN antagonist killer 1 (GENEIN) as a molecular target of CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis. CHEMICALIN directly interacts with GENEIN and induces mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. Although GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), another member of the GENENOTIN family, are generally thought to be functionally redundant, only GENENOTIN is necessary and sufficient for CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN (GENEIN) release and cell death. Moreover, CHEMICALIN, an intracellular metabolite of CHEMICALIN, was shown to covalently bind to the CHEMICALIN-166 residue of GENEIN. Several lines of evidence suggested that the covalent attachment of CHEMICALNOTIN is critical for apoptosis induction. Thus this study reveals a specific role for GENENOTIN in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. This study also provides insight into the anticancer effects of CHEMICALIN and suggests that GENEIN may be a potential target of cancer therapy.
23142538	Effect of developmental CHEMICALNOTIN exposure on methylation and expression of specific imprinted genes in mice. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an endocrine disruptor affecting the reproductive system in humans. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN administered to pregnant mice at two different doses (2-10 ng/kg/day), on imprinted genes in the male offspring. The degree of methylation and the mRNA expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were analyzed in the sperm, skeletal muscle and liver. CHEMICALNOTIN administration (10 ng/kg/day) decreased the sperm count in the male offspring. It did not affect methylation but increased mRNA expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. In muscle and liver, CHEMICALIN (10 ng/kg/day) induced increases in methylation and decreases in mRNA expression of GENEIN. These results show that the robust effects of CHEMICALIN on the mRNA expression of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN genes in the sperm and of GENEIN in the muscle and liver are unrelated to changes in methylation in their respective genes.
20624440	CHEMICALIN protects against GENEIN induced sensitivity to oxidative stress in dopaminergic cells. CHEMICALIN is a CHEMICALIN and irreversible GENEIN inhibitor used for the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). It has demonstrated neuroprotective properties in laboratory studies. Current concepts of PD aetiopathogenesis include the role of GENENOTIN, protein aggregation, free radical metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction in contributing to cell death. We have used a combination of GENENOTIN and free radical mediated toxicity in a dopaminergic cell line to provide a model of nigral toxicity in order to investigate the potential molecular mechanisms that mediate CHEMICALNOTIN protection. We demonstrate that CHEMICALIN protects against cell death induced by the combination of free radicals generated by CHEMICALNOTIN and either wild-type or GENEIN mutant GENEIN over-expression. This protection was associated with a reduction in GENENOTIN activation, a reduction in CHEMICALNOTIN generation and a trend to ameliorate the fall in mitochondrial membrane potential. CHEMICALNOTIN induced an increase in cellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels. The results support a role for CHEMICALIN in protecting dopaminergic cells against free radical mediated damage and apoptosis in the presence of GENEIN over-expression. The data are of relevance to the interpretation of the potential mechanisms of action of CHEMICALNOTIN in explaining the results of disease modification trials in PD.
19337422	CHEMICALNOTIN and its potential in the treatment of hyponatremia. CHEMICALIN is a selective GENEIN blocker used to induce free water diuresis in the treatment of euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia. Currently the orally active medication is in the final stages prior to approval by the FDA for outpatient therapy. It appears to be safe and effective at promoting aquaresis and raising serum CHEMICALNOTIN levels in both short- and long-term studies. CHEMICALNOTIN is also effective for treatment of congestive heart failure (CHF) exacerbation, but whether there are long standing beneficial effects on CHF is still controversial. Prolonged use of CHEMICALIN leads to increased endogenous levels of GENEIN and perhaps over-stimulation of GENEIN. Theoretically this activation could lead to increased afterload and cardiac myocyte fibrosis, causing progression of CHF. However, after 52 weeks of CHEMICALNOTIN therapy there was no worsening of left ventricular dilatation. In addition, CHEMICALIN is metabolized by the GENEIN system; thus physicians should be aware of the potential for increased interactions with other medications. CHEMICALIN is a breakthrough in the therapy of hyponatremia as it directly combats elevated GENEIN levels associated with the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of GENENOTIN, congestive heart failure, and cirrhosis of the liver.
11156594	GENENOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN neurones: relation to Transport-P. 1. Peptidergic neurones accumulate CHEMICALNOTIN via an unusual uptake process, designated Transport-P. CHEMICALIN binds to GENEIN on these cells and is displaceable by unlabelled CHEMICALIN in concentrations up to 10(-7) M. However, at greater concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN, there is a paradoxical accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN which we have attributed to Transport-P. Uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN via Transport-P is detectable at 10(-10) M CHEMICALNOTIN concentration, is linear up to 10(-7) M and at greater concentrations becomes non-linear. In contrast, in noradrenergic neurones, CHEMICALNOTIN uptake is linear and saturates above 10(-7) M. In noradrenergic neurones and in non-neuronal cells, there is no uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN in concentrations up to 10(-6) M, suggesting that Transport-P is a specialised function of peptidergic neurones. 2. Using a mouse peptidergic (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) neuronal cell line which possesses Transport-P, we have studied the interaction of GENENOTIN with Transport-P. Polymerase chain reactions and DNA sequencing of the products demonstrated that only the GENENOTIN is present in CHEMICALNOTIN cells. 3. In COS cells transfected with GENEIN cDNA and in DDT(1) MF-2 cells which express native GENEIN, CHEMICALIN was displaced by unlabelled CHEMICALIN in a normal equilibrium process, with no CHEMICALNOTIN paradox in concentrations up to 10(-6) M. In DDT(1) MF-2 cells, CHEMICALIN was displaced likewise by a series of GENEIN adrenergic agonists, none of which increased the binding of CHEMICALIN. Hence, the CHEMICALNOTIN paradox is not due to some function of GENENOTIN, such as internalization of ligand-receptor complexes. 4. In neurones which possess Transport-P, transfection with GENENOTIN cDNA resulted in over-expression of GENENOTIN, but the CHEMICALNOTIN paradox was unaltered. Thus, GENENOTIN and Transport-P mediate distinct functions in peptidergic neurones.
23277230	CHEMICALNOTIN averts oxidative stress in pancreatic tissues of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced diabetic rats. Persistent hyperglycemia is associated with chronic oxidative stress which contributes to the development and progression of diabetes-associated complications. The sensitivity of pancreatic Î²-cells to oxidative stress has been attributed to their low content of antioxidants compared with other tissues. Bioactive compounds with potent antidiabetic properties have been shown to ameliorate hyperglycemia mediated oxidative stress. Recently, we have reported that oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (10Â mg/Kg b.w.), a CHEMICALNOTIN found to be present in strawberries, persimmon, to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced experimental diabetic rats significantly improved normoglycemia. The present study was aimed to evaluate the antioxidant potential of CHEMICALNOTIN in both in vitro and in vivo. Diabetes was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICALNOTIN (50Â mg/kg body weight). CHEMICALNOTIN was administered orally for 30Â days. At the end of the study, all animals were killed. Blood samples were collected for the biochemical estimations. The antioxidant status was evaluated. Histological examinations were performed on pancreatic tissues. CHEMICALIN treatment showed a significant decline in the levels of blood CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN GENEIN unit (in pancreas) and GENEIN (plasma), serum CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) with an elevation in plasma GENEIN. The treatment also improved the antioxidant status in pancreas as well as plasma of diabetic rats indicating the antioxidant potential of CHEMICALNOTIN. In addition, the results of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN assays substantiate the free radical scavenging activity of CHEMICALNOTIN. Histological studies of the pancreas also evidenced the tissue protective nature of CHEMICALNOTIN. It is concluded that, CHEMICALNOTIN possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory property and may be considered as an adjunct for the treatment of diabetes.
6872937	Inhibition of the uterotropic activity of estrogens and antiestrogens by the short acting antiestrogen CHEMICALNOTIN. The aim of the study was to determine whether the dihydroxylated antiestrogen CHEMICALIN, with a high affinity for the GENEIN and low intrinsic estrogenic activity, could inhibit the uterotropic actions of steroidal [CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)] and nonsteroidal [ICI 3188 and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)] estrogens in immature rats and also the uterotropic actions of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in the ovariectomized mouse and immature rat. In the first series of experiments, CHEMICALNOTIN was compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. Both antiestrogens inhibited the uterotropic actions of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.32 micrograms daily), ICI 3188 (5 micrograms daily), and TACE (40 and 160 micrograms daily) in a dose-related manner (0.32-82 micrograms daily). The potency of the antiestrogens against E2 and ICI 3188 was similar, however, at higher doses (20.48 and 82 micrograms daily) CHEMICALNOTIN reduced uterine weights to below the lowest level achieved by CHEMICALNOTIN. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN was less effective against the long acting estrogen TACE. The competitive interaction of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was compared in 3-day ovariectomized mouse and immature rat uterine weight tests. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were fully estrogenic in the mouse (5 micrograms daily) and partially estrogenic in the rat (1.5-20 micrograms daily). CHEMICALNOTIN was a partial estrogen in the mouse and a weekly active partial estrogen in the rat (2.5-120 micrograms daily). CHEMICALNOTIN produced dose-related decreases in the uterine weight increases induced by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in both species. However, in the rat, CHEMICALNOTIN was more effective against the less potent compound CHEMICALNOTIN, at a 6:1 dosage ratio compared with a 24:1 dosage ratio required for the potent compound CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN had a short duration of action as an antiestrogen when compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (120 micrograms) was only completely effective as an antiestrogen if administered repeatedly with CHEMICALNOTIN whereas a single injection of CHEMICALNOTIN (120 micrograms) was sufficient to inhibit fully CHEMICALNOTIN action in the uterus for up to 4 days. Because CHEMICALNOTIN has a shorter duration of action than CHEMICALNOTIN, a high dosage ratio of CHEMICALNOTIN over CHEMICALNOTIN is required to maintain effective competitive antagonism in the uterus. Overall, these findings suggest that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN probably act through the same mechanism of action via the GENEIN.
23423570	High-CHEMICALIN environment enhanced oxidative stress and increased GENEIN secretion from keratinocytes: New insights on impaired diabetic wound healing. Impaired wound healing frequently occurs in patients with diabetes. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) production by keratinocyte is responsible for recruiting neutrophils during healing. Intense inflammation is associated with diabetic wounds while reduction of neutrophil infiltration is associated with enhanced healing. We hypothesized that increased neutrophil recruitment by keratinocytes may contribute to the delayed healing of diabetic wound. Using cultured human keratinocytes and diabetic rat model, the current study showed that high-CHEMICALIN environment enhanced GENEIN production via GENEIN (GENEIN) -GENEIN (GENEIN) pathway in a reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS)-dependent manner in keratinocytes. In addition, diabetic rat skin showed enhanced GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression as compared to control rats. The dermal neutrophil infiltration of the wound, as represented by expression of GENENOTIN level, was also significantly higher in diabetic rats. Treating diabetic rats with CHEMICALNOTIN, an agent known to inhibit neutrophil function, was associated with improved healing. In conclusion, GENEIN production and neutrophil infiltration are increased in high-CHEMICALIN environment due to elevated ROS level and contributed to impaired wound healing in diabetic skin. Targeting these dysfunctions may present novel therapeutic approaches.
23313794	Effects of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on histopathology, oxidative stress, and expression of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in rat stomachs. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is one of the most abundant CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) generated from overcooking meat at high temperatures. To understand the possible mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN-associated stomach cancer, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on morphology, oxidative stress, gene expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in rat stomachs were investigated. The results showed that (1) 15mg/kg body weight CHEMICALNOTIN induced obvious histopathological changes in gastric mucosa; (2) CHEMICALIN (10 and/or 15mg/kg) significantly decreased GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) activities, while increased GENEIN (GENEIN) activity compared with the control. With the elevated doses of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) contents, protein CHEMICALNOTIN (PCO) contents and DNA-protein crosslinks (DPC) coefficients were significantly raised in a dose-dependent manner; (3) CHEMICALIN at the doses of 10mg/kg and/or 15mg/kg significantly inhibited GENEIN mRNA and protein expression, whereas enhanced GENEIN and GENEIN expression relative to control. The data indicated that CHEMICALIN could cause stomach injury, oxidative stress in rat stomachs as well as the activation of GENEIN and GENEIN and inactivation of GENEIN, which may play a role in the pathogenesis of CHEMICALNOTIN-associated stomach cancer.
23542578	A novel method for preparing complete antigens of CHEMICALNOTIN and their feature of immunogenicity. In this paper, a novel method was proposed to prepare artificial antigens of gonyaulax parlaytic shellfish toxin 2 and 3 (CHEMICALNOTIN). An intermediate CHEMICALNOTIN was first synthesized by activating the CHEMICALNOTIN group of the 2nd and 8th CHEMICALNOTIN residues with three different CHEMICALNOTIN and two artificial complete antigens CHEMICALIN-GENEIN (GENEIN) and CHEMICALIN- GENEIN (GENEIN) were then prepared by cross-linking the intermediate with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN. The successful preparation of the two complete antigens was confirmed by UV spectral scanning, HPLC, production of antibodies with titer of 1.28Â ÃÂ 10(4) from mice immunized with the two complete antigens, indirect ELISA and Western-blot. In conclusion, the synthesized complete antigens have strong immunogenicity, which provides a solid foundation for preparing CHEMICALNOTIN monoclonal antibody and rapid detection kit.
12003347	CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis: a novel biological role for CHEMICALNOTIN. Ever since the discovery that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a cofactor of GENEIN, its function has been the object of intense research and occasional controversy. Only in the last couple of years a consensus has been reached on what constitutes the main role of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis. In this review we aim to provide an outline of the various ways in which CHEMICALIN affects GENEIN catalysis. First we give a brief general description of the structure and catalytic mechanism of GENENOTIN, with special emphasis on those aspects of catalysis that are actively debated, and that directly or indirectly involve CHEMICALNOTIN. Foremost among those issues is uncoupled catalysis, i.e. the GENEIN-catalyzed oxidation of CHEMICALIN in the absence of substrate or pterin that does not result in CHEMICALIN production. We also shortly discuss the ongoing debate on whether CHEMICALIN is the actual reaction product of GENEIN catalysis, as well as the phenomenon of CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated autoinhibition. We describe the function of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN hydroxylation, and discuss the allosteric and structural effects that CHEMICALIN exerts on GENEIN. Next we turn our attention to what is now becoming accepted as the central function of CHEMICALNOTIN: its capacity to act as a 1-electron donor during reductive activation of the CHEMICALNOTIN complex of the heme. Finally, we illustrate how CHEMICALIN might transform the GENEIN dimer into an efficient GENEIN,and briefly touch on some more speculative aspects of the role of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis.
1375507	CHEMICALIN analogues inhibit GENEIN expression in the human monocytic cell line THP-1 via a CHEMICALIN-dependent mechanism. Increased expression of GENENOTIN procoagulant by peripheral blood monocytes has been implicated in a number of thrombotic disorders. The present studies were undertaken to determine whether stable analogues of CHEMICALIN, a potent endothelium-derived platelet inhibitor and vasodilator, could inhibit GENEIN expression by human monocytic cells. Exposure of monocytic tumor THP-1 cells to 100 ng/ml endotoxin, 2 units/ml GENENOTIN, or 5 ng/ml GENENOTIN for 4 hours led to increased GENENOTIN procoagulant activity. Preincubation for 30 minutes with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN led to a dose-dependent inhibition of GENEIN expression induced by all three challenging agents. CHEMICALNOTIN was the most potent: 50% inhibition occurred at 5 nM, a concentration close to the reported dissociation constant for CHEMICALIN binding to the platelet GENEIN. An orally active analogue, CHEMICALIN, was equally effective against endotoxin-induced GENEIN expression. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were 100 times less potent. Iloprost prevented the endotoxin-induced expression of GENENOTIN antigen on the surface of THP-1 cells, as determined by flow cytometry. CHEMICALNOTIN (500 pM-50 nM) increased intracellular levels of CHEMICALNOTIN. This effect was potentiated by CHEMICALIN, an inhibitor of GENEIN. The inhibitory effects of iloprost on GENEIN expression were also potentiated by CHEMICALIN and mimicked by CHEMICALIN and dCHEMICALIN but not CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that CHEMICALIN may play a role in downregulating GENEIN expression in monocytes, at least in part via elevation of intracellular levels of CHEMICALIN.
11071707	Amphetamine-type central nervous system stimulants release norepinephrine more potently than they release dopamine and serotonin. A large body of evidence supports the hypothesis that mesolimbic dopamine (DA) mediates, in animal models, the reinforcing effects of central nervous system stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamine. The role DA plays in mediating amphetamine-type subjective effects of stimulants in humans remains to be established. Both amphetamine and cocaine increase norepinephrine (NE) via stimulation of release and inhibition of reuptake, respectively. If increases in NE mediate amphetamine-type subjective effects of stimulants in humans, then one would predict that stimulant medications that produce amphetamine-type subjective effects in humans should share the ability to increase NE. To test this hypothesis, we determined, using in vitro methods, the neurochemical mechanism of action of amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), (+)-methamphetamine, ephedrine, phentermine, and aminorex. As expected, their rank order of potency for DA release was similar to their rank order of potency in published self-administration studies. Interestingly, the results demonstrated that the most potent effect of these stimulants is to release NE. Importantly, the oral dose of these stimulants, which produce amphetamine-type subjective effects in humans, correlated with the their potency in releasing NE, not DA, and did not decrease plasma prolactin, an effect mediated by DA release. These results suggest that NE may contribute to the amphetamine-type subjective effects of stimulants in humans.
15526004	Genetic risk factors for infection in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis. We analyzed clinical and genetic factors contributing to infections in 457 subjects with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) enrolled in a prospective, 1-year clinical trial of methotrexate and the TNF inhibitor etanercept. Subjects were genotyped for the following single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): (TNF -308, -238, and + 488); lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) (LTA + 249, + 365, and + 720); and Fc gamma receptors FCGR2A 131 H/R; FCGR3A 176 F/V; and FCGR3B NA 1/2 and genotypes were correlated with infections. At least one URI was noted in 52% of subjects (99/191) with the NA2/NA2 genotype of the neutrophil-specific FCGR3B gene, compared to 42% (77/181) of those with the NA1/NA2 genotype and 39% (23/59) of those with the NA1/NA1 genotype (P = 0.038). Urinary tract infection (UTI) was associated with the TNF -238 A (odds ratio(OR) 2.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-6.25) and LTA +365 C (OR 1.73, 95% CI 1.07-2.79) alleles, and marginally with the FCGR3A F allele (OR 1.72, 95% CI 0.99-3.00). There was a striking linear correlation between UTI and the number of risk alleles defined by these three SNPs (P < 0.001), suggesting an additive effect on susceptibility. These findings have important implications for the role of genetics in susceptibility to bacterial and viral infections.
23360475	Design, synthesis, and structure-activity relationship studies of tryptanthrins as antitubercular agents. The natural product tryptanthrin (1a) represents a potential lead for new tuberculosis (TB) drugs since tryptanthrin and its synthetic analogues possess potent in vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). However, in spite of their in vitro activity, none of these agents have been shown to be efficacious in vivo against animal models of TB. Described herein are syntheses of new tryptanthrin analogues together with a systematic investigation of their in vitro antitubercular activity and ADME properties followed by pharmacokinetic characterization in rodents for the most promising compounds. Those with the best potency and oral bioavailability were progressed to evaluations of efficacy against acute murine TB. The work aimed to prove the concept that this compound class can limit growth of Mtb during infection as well as to establish the SAR for in vitro activity against Mtb and the range of in vitro ADME parameters for this class of natural products. Novel C-11-deoxy (5b) and A-ring-saturated (6) tryptanthrin analogues were discovered that maintained activity against Mtb and showed improved solubility compared to tryptanthrin as well as evidence of oral bioavailability in rodents. However, neither 5b nor 6 demonstrated efficacy against acute murine TB following administration at doses up to 400 mg/kg daily for 4 weeks. Although 5b and 6 failed to inhibit replication or kill Mtb in vivo, they illuminate a path to new structural variations of the tryptanthrin scaffold that may maximize the potential of this class of compounds against TB.
23179966	Serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine reciprocal interactions as putative molecular targets for novel antipsychotic treatments: from receptor heterodimers to postsynaptic scaffolding and effector proteins. The physical and functional interactions between serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine signaling have been suggested to be involved in psychosis pathophysiology and are supposed to be relevant for antipsychotic treatment. Type II metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors have been reported to form heterodimers that modulate G-protein-mediated intracellular signaling differentially compared to mGluR2 and 5-HT(2A) homomers. Additionally, direct evidence has been provided that D(2) and 5-HT(2A) receptors form physical heterocomplexes which exert a functional cross-talk, as demonstrated by studies on hallucinogen-induced signaling. Moving from receptors to postsynaptic density (PSD) scenario, the scaffolding protein PSD-95 is known to interact with N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), D(2) and 5-HT(2) receptors, regulating their activation state. Homer1a, the inducible member of the Homer family of PSD proteins that is implicated in glutamatergic signal transduction, is induced in striatum by antipsychotics with high dopamine receptor affinity and in the cortex by antipsychotics with mixed serotonergic/dopaminergic profile. Signaling molecules, such as Akt and glycogen-synthase-kinase-3 (GSK-3), could be involved in the mechanism of action of antipsychotics, targeting dopamine, serotonin, and glutamate neurotransmission. Altogether, these proteins stand at the crossroad of glutamate-dopamine-serotonin signaling pathways and may be considered as valuable molecular targets for current and new antipsychotics. The aim of this review is to provide a critical appraisal on serotonin-glutamate and serotonin-dopamine interplay to support the idea that next generation schizophrenia pharmacotherapy should not exclusively rely on receptor targeting strategies.
12955294	The serotonin transporter polymorphism, 5HTTLPR, is associated with a faster response time to sertraline in an elderly population with major depressive disorder. RATIONALE: A common polymorphism (5HTTLPR) within the promoter region of the serotonin transporter gene (LSC6A4) has been shown to influence response time as well as overall response to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in subjects with major depressive disorder. We hypothesized that a similar effect in response time to sertraline would be observed and that no effect on response time would be seen in a placebo arm. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypothesis that subjects homozygous for the long allele at the 5HTTLPR polymorphism would respond more rapidly to sertraline than subjects carrying one or two copies of the short allele. METHODS: HAM-D and CGI-I responses to sertraline and placebo were measured weekly in the context of an 8-week, placebo-controlled study in elderly depressed subjects. Genotyping of the 5HTTLPR polymorphism was performed to test for correlations with response at each week in the sertraline and placebo groups ( n=206). RESULTS: Subjects homozygous for the long allele of 5HTTLPR showed a significant increase in response at week 1 and week 2, as assessed by the CGI-I scale compared with subjects carrying one or two copies of the short allele ( P=0.01 at both weeks). No significant difference was observed in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that genetic variation in the serotonin transporter gene effects the response time to sertraline and provides complementing evidence to previous reports that this polymorphism affects response time to other SSRIs.
23085085	GENENOTIN is required for maintenance of bone mass during aging. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a nuclear enzyme that removes CHEMICALIN groups from CHEMICALIN residues in GENEIN and other proteins to epigenetically regulate gene expression. GENENOTIN interacts with bone-related transcription factors and co-factors such as GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and thus is poised to play a key role in the skeletal system. To understand the role of GENENOTIN in osteoblasts and osteocytes, GENENOTIN conditional knockout (CKO) mice were created with the GENENOTIN driving GENENOTIN expression. GENENOTIN CKO(GENENOTIN) mice were of normal size and weight, but progressively lost trabecular and cortical bone mass with age. The GENENOTIN CKO(GENENOTIN) mice exhibited reduced cortical bone mineralization and material properties and suffered frequent fractures. Bone resorption was lower, not higher, in the GENENOTIN CKO(GENENOTIN) mice, suggesting that primary defects in osteoblasts caused the reduced bone mass. Indeed, reductions in bone formation were observed. Osteoblasts and osteocytes from GENENOTIN CKO(GENENOTIN) mice showed increased DNA damage and reduced functional activity in vivo and in vitro. Thus, GENENOTIN expression in osteoblasts and osteocytes is essential for bone maintenance during aging.
15132128	Enzyme expression profiles suggest the novel tumor-activated CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) might be effective against papillary thyroid cancers of children and young adults. PURPOSE: The CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is converted to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) by GENEIN (GENEIN) inside target tissues. CHEMICALIN interferes with DNA synthesis by blocking GENEIN (GENEIN) but is inactivated by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Favorable enzyme profiles (high GENEIN and low GENEIN) generate high intratumor levels of CHEMICALIN that are effective against many tumors, especially those with low GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN has not been tested against thyroid cancers, and it is not known to what extent thyroid cancers express GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN. METHODS: To test this, we determined GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in 19 thyroid cancers from young patients (14 papillary, 4 follicular, 1 medullary) by immunohistochemistry. After approval by the Human Use Committee, the intensity of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN staining was determined by two independent examiners and graded (absent=0 to intense=3) with >90% concordance. RESULTS: GENENOTIN was detected in 7/19 cancers (37%), GENENOTIN in 14/19 cancers (74%) and GENENOTIN in 14/19 cancers (74%). In six tumors, GENENOTIN was more intense that GENENOTIN, suggesting capecitabine sensitivity. Only five tumors failed to express GENENOTIN but four of these expressed GENEIN, suggesting CHEMICALIN resistance. Overall, 6/19 tumors (32% of the total) had a favorable expression profile, and all of them were papillary cancers. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers (74%) express GENENOTIN and low levels of GENENOTIN (63% undetectable). The results support the hypothesis that CHEMICALNOTIN is activated in the majority of differentiated thyroid cancers and that 32% have favorable expression of all three enzymes (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN).
8667211	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs activate GENENOTIN by a direct mechanism of action. Previous studies by this research team proved that vasodilating CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) E1, E2 and I2 inhibit GENEIN (GENEIN) in vitro and in vivo, which suggested involvement of GENENOTIN in gastric acid secretion inhibition and the increase of gastric mucosa blood flow produced by this group of CHEMICALNOTIN. Relying on these findings, as well as on our clinical observations, we studied in vitro and in vivo the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. We also followed in vitro the effects on these isozymes of NSAIDs associated to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, PGE2 and CHEMICALNOTIN. The results show that the NSAIDs used here, which reduce the activity of GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN production, activated GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in a dose-dependent manner by a mechanism of the noncompetitive type. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALIN added to NSAIDs amplified the activating effect of the latter on GENEIN. Association of PGE2 or CHEMICALIN to NSAIDs reduced NSAID-induced activation of GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN abolished the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN and GENEIN. Our data imply that between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN there is an inverse relationship, GENENOTIN activation being accompanied by reduction of GENENOTIN activity, a reduction achieved by the pH modifications induced by GENENOTIN activation. In this way, GENENOTIN, inhibition occurs "via GENENOTIN," with the pH variations it brings about.
23360232	Surface-modified HK:siRNA nanoplexes with enhanced pharmacokinetics and tumor growth inhibition. We characterized in this study the pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy of histidine-lysine (HK):siRNA nanoplexes modified with PEG and a cyclic RGD (cRGD) ligand targeting Î±vÎ²3 and Î±vÎ²5 integrins. With noninvasive imaging, systemically administered surface-modified HK:siRNA nanoplexes showed nearly 4-fold greater blood levels, 40% higher accumulation in tumor tissue, and 60% lower luciferase activity than unmodified HK:siRNA nanoplexes. We then determined whether the surface-modified HK:siRNA nanoplex carrier was more effective in reducing MDA-MB-435 tumor growth with an siRNA targeting Raf-1. Repeated systemic administration of the selected surface modified HK:siRNA nanoplexes targeting Raf-1 showed 35% greater inhibition of tumor growth than unmodified HK:siRNA nanoplexes and 60% greater inhibition of tumor growth than untreated mice. The improved blood pharmacokinetic results and tumor localization observed with the integrin-targeting surface modification of HK:siRNA nanoplexes correlated with greater tumor growth inhibition. This investigation reveals that through control of targeting ligand surface display in association with a steric PEG layer, modified HK: siRNA nanoplexes show promise to advance RNAi therapeutics in oncology and potentially other critical diseases.
17651117	Inhibition of platelet receptors involved in neutrophil-platelet interaction in model cardiopulmonary bypass. We investigated the interactions between neutrophils, platelets, and artificial surfaces, and whether blocking of relevant receptors on platelets reduced unwanted activation responses in model cardiopulmonary bypass. Isolated neutrophils and platelets resuspended in heparin-anticoagulated plasma were recirculated with and without blocking antibodies to CD62P, CD42b, or junctional adhesion molecule C (JAM-C) in polyvinyl chloride tubing using a roller pump. Platelet adhesion to the tubing was inhibited by anti-CD42b and anti-CD62P, and adhesion of neutrophils by anti-JAM-C. Formation of platelet-neutrophil and platelet aggregates was reduced by anti-CD62P. Anti-JAM-C decreased platelet-neutrophil aggregation at low concentrations and platelet macroaggregates at high concentrations. Anti-CD62P increased neutrophil CD11b expression but not degranulation. Anti-JAM-C substantially increased neutrophil degranulation and slightly increased CD11b expression. Platelet activation increased when CD62P was blocked and decreased with anti-CD42b antibody. High-dose anti-JAM-C reduced platelet activation. In conclusion, inhibiting platelet and neutrophil-platelet interactions had useful effects but no single blocking antibody seemed capable of inducing only beneficial effects.
12047490	A comparison of the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN vs CHEMICALNOTIN on serum CHEMICALNOTIN and platelet function in healthy volunteers. AIMS: To compare the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, two GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) preferential nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), on platelet GENENOTIN activity and platelet function. METHODS: Twelve healthy volunteers (3 male, 9 female, median age 22 years) participated in an open, randomized, cross-over trial of CHEMICALNOTIN 1000 mg twice daily vs CHEMICALNOTIN 7.5 mg twice daily during 1 week with 2 weeks wash-out. After a second 2 week wash-out period, one dose of CHEMICALNOTIN 50 mg was given as a positive control to check for NSAID induced inhibition of platelet function. GENEIN inhibition was measured as percentage inhibition of serum CHEMICALIN generation in clotting whole blood, and as closure time with use of the platelet function analyser PFA-100. Data are reported as median with range. Paired variables were analysed using Wilcoxons signed rank test. RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN levels decreased significantly after all three medications, but percentage inhibition after CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (88% and 97%, respectively) was significantly higher than after CHEMICALNOTIN (63%) (P<0.05). Closure times increased significantly after administration of all three medications (P<0.05). Increases in closure time after administration did not differ between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (24% and 14%, respectively), but were significantly larger after CHEMICALNOTIN administration (63%) (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In the maximum registered dosage, CHEMICALIN inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN production much more than meloxicam, signifying less GENEIN selectivity of the former. However, both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN cause only minor impairment in platelet function in comparison with CHEMICALNOTIN and the difference between them is not significant.
12826271	CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits proliferation and differentiation of neural stem cells. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are widely used in clinical situations as anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic drugs. However, it is still unknown whether NSAIDs have effects on the development of the central nervous system. In the present study, we investigated the effects of NSAIDs on neural stem cell (NSC) proliferation and differentiation into neurons. In contrast to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM) for 2 days induced the death of NSCs in a concentration-dependent manner. CHEMICALNOTIN also inhibited the proliferation of NSCs and their differentiation into neurons. Treatment with CHEMICALIN resulted in nuclear condensation (a morphological change due to apoptosis of NSCs) 24hr after the treatment and activated GENEIN after 6 hr, indicating that CHEMICALIN may cause apoptosis of neuronal cells via activation of the GENEIN cascade. These results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN may affect the development of the central nervous system.
23563205	Correlation between activation of GENEIN and GENEIN downregulation in a mouse adipocyte cell line by a series of CHEMICALIN. The present study shows significant correlations between the EC50 for GENENOTIN activation in a reporter gene cell line and GENENOTIN downregulation in mouse adipocytes, and between the IC50 for GENENOTIN downregulation and the already published minimum effective dose for antihyperglycemic activity in a mouse model. These correlations indicate that GENENOTIN mediated downregulation of resistin might promote GENENOTIN sensitivity and that downregulation of GENENOTIN in mouse adipocytes provides an adequate and possibly more direct bioassay for screening of newly developed antihyperglycemic compounds. Because of the higher throughput of the GENENOTIN the GENENOTIN downregulation assays seems most suitable to be used as a second tier in a tiered screening strategy.
23305850	Identification of GENENOTIN as GENENOTIN-target marker genes in human cells. Transcription factor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) plays a crucial role in the cellular defense against oxidative/electrophilic stress by up-regulating multiple antioxidant genes. Numerous studies with genetically modified animals have demonstrated that GENENOTIN is a sensitivity determining factor upon the exposure to environmental chemicals including carcinogens. Moreover, recent studies have demonstrated that polymorphism in the GENENOTIN is associated with higher risks for developing acute lung injury, gastric mucosal inflammation, and nephritis. Therefore, the identification of reliable and effective human target genes of GENENOTIN may allow the monitoring of GENENOTIN activity and to predict individual sensitivity to environmental stress-induced damage. For this purpose, we investigated genes that are tightly controlled by GENENOTIN to establish markers for GENENOTIN activity in human cells. Firstly, in the normal human renal epithelial HK-2 cells, the measurement of the expression of 30 previously reported GENEIN target genes in response to GENEIN inducers (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) showed that the GENEIN is highly inducible by all treatments. Accordantly, the basal and inducible expressions of GENENOTIN were significantly attenuated in GENENOTIN-silenced HK-2 cells. Whereas, cells with stable GENENOTIN knockdown, which causes a modest GENENOTIN activation, demonstrated substantially increased levels of GENENOTIN. Secondly, the linkage between GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN was confirmed in human monocytic leukemia cell line U937, which can be a model of peripherally available blood cells. The treatment of U937 cells with GENEIN inducers including CHEMICALIN effectively elevated the expression of GENEIN. Whereas, the levels of both the basal and CHEMICALIN-inducible expression of GENEIN were significantly reduced in GENEIN-silenced stable U937 cells compared to the control cells. Similarly, the inducible expression of GENENOTIN was observed in another human monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 as well as in human primary blood CD14(+) monocytes. In conclusion, together with the high inducibility and GENENOTIN dependency shown in renal epithelial cells as well as in peripherally available blood cells, current findings suggest that GENENOTIN can be utilized as a marker of GENENOTIN activity in human cells.
19683471	Cellular mechanisms of GENENOTIN resistance: role of GENENOTIN and GENEIN (GENEIN) CHEMICALIN phosphorylation. GENEIN (GENEIN) CHEMICALIN phosphorylation is a time-controlled physiological feedback mechanism in GENENOTIN signaling that is hijacked by metabolic and inflammatory stresses to promote GENENOTIN resistance. GENENOTIN, including GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, activated by the inducers of GENENOTIN resistance induce uncontrolled GENEIN CHEMICALIN phosphorylation. Studies with genetically modified mice reveal that these GENENOTIN integrate signals from metabolic and inflammatory stresses in adipose tissue, liver, and hypothalamus leading to peripheral and central GENENOTIN resistance. Moreover, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN pathways in myeloid cells represent a core mechanism involved in inflammation linked to obesity. These GENENOTIN are thus potential drug targets against GENENOTIN resistance and the targeting of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN or the GENENOTIN pathway may evolve into future diabetes medication.
10446934	CHEMICALIN-converting enzyme inhibition and GENENOTIN receptor blockade modify the pressure-natriuresis relationship by additive mechanisms in rats with GENEIN and GENEIN genes. The intrarenal factors responsible for hypertension in double-transgenic rats (dTGR) harboring GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes are unclear. The pressure-natriuresis and -diuresis relationships in response to chronic GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibition and GENENOTIN receptor blockade were evaluated. GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg/kg, orally) or CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination. In untreated dTGR, pressure-natriuresis relationships were maximally shifted rightward by approximately 70 to 80 mmHg, and both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were markedly decreased. Submaximal CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN dosages both decreased systolic BP by 30 mmHg and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward by 25 to 30 mmHg. CHEMICALNOTIN increased RBF and GFR to values observed in normotensive control animals but did not significantly affect fractional CHEMICALNOTIN excretion (FENa) or fractional water excretion (FEH2O) curves. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN had no significant effect on RBF or GFR but shifted the FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. The CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN combination completely normalized BP and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward more than did either drug alone. When CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were administered at higher doses (30 mg/kg, orally), the two drugs equally shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward, by 50 mmHg. Both drugs increased RBF and GFR; however, only CHEMICALNOTIN shifted FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. GENEIN and GENEIN genes were downregulated in dTGR and were increased by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN treatments, whereas no changes in the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN receptor genes were observed. GENEIN expression was increased by CHEMICALIN but not by CHEMICALIN. Neither GENENOTIN nor GENENOTIN gene expression was affected by drug treatments. Therefore, submaximal GENENOTIN inhibition enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal GENENOTIN receptor blockade decreased tubular CHEMICALNOTIN and water reabsorption. The combination of the two drugs produced an additive effect. The GENENOTIN inhibitor effects may involve increased GENENOTIN expression, perhaps related to the inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN degradation.
12123767	A novel GENEIN arrhythmia mutation, GENEIN, with expression defect rescued by CHEMICALIN. OBJECTIVE: Mutations in the cardiac CHEMICALNOTIN channel gene, GENENOTIN, cause congenital long QT syndrome (LQT3), Brugada syndrome, idiopathic ventricular fibrillation, and conduction disease by distinct cellular and clinical electrophysiological phenotypes. METHODS: Postmortem molecular analysis of GENENOTIN was conducted on an infant who presented shortly after birth with self-terminating torsades de pointes. The infant was treated with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN and was stable for 16 months manifesting only a prolonged QT interval. The infant collapsed suddenly following presumed viral gastroenteritis, was found in 2:1 AV block, and was subsequently declared brain dead. Genomic DNA was subjected to GENENOTIN mutational analyses and DNA sequencing revealing a novel, spontaneous germline missense mutation, GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN mutation was engineered into the hH1a clone by site-directed mutagenesis, transfected into embryonic kidney cells (HEK-293), and studied by voltage clamp. RESULTS: The GENENOTIN mutation caused a significant decrease in the CHEMICALNOTIN channel expression. Co-expression with beta1 subunit, incubation at low temperature, and most effectively incubation with CHEMICALNOTIN partially 'rescued' the defective expression. In addition to this pronounced loss of function, GENEIN also showed a 10-fold increase in the persistent late CHEMICALIN current. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN channel dysfunction may contribute to the basis of lethal arrhythmias, displays an overlapping electrophysiological phenotype, and represents the first CHEMICALNOTIN channelopathy rescued by drug.
23219339	Neuroprotective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN against excitotoxicity partially through down-regulation of GENENOTIN-containing GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a major bioactive component derived from Sophora flavescens Ait (kushen), which is widely used in Chinese medicine. Recent studies have shown that it has neuroprotective effects; however, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We focus on the mechanisms of pharmacologic action in CHEMICALNOTIN by detecting its pharmacological properties against focal cerebral ischemia in vivo and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxicity in vitro. CHEMICALNOTIN prevented cerebral ischemic injury in mice induced via a 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion and a 24 h reperfusion, in vivo. In vitro cultured neurons challenged with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, 200 Î¼M) for 30 min showed significant decrease in the viability of neurons; however, CHEMICALNOTIN was able to protect neurons against induced neurotoxicity via CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. Western blot analysis revealed that CHEMICALIN decreased the expression of GENEIN and repaired the balance of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN significantly reversed the up-regulation of GENEIN and inhibited the CHEMICALNOTIN overload in the cultured neurons after challenging the CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN showed partial protection in the cortical neurons via down-regulation of GENEIN containing GENEIN and up-regulation of GENEIN family. Our results provide new insights into the development of natural therapeutic anti-oxidants against ischemia.
23454300	Phenotypic analysis of ovine antigen presenting cells loaded with nanoparticles migrating from the site of vaccination. Virus-sized particulate adjuvants such as ISCOMs, polystyrene nanoparticles and virus-like particles have been shown to target dendritic cells, resulting in the activation of T and B cells in vivo. Using an ovine pseudo-afferent lymph cannulation model to capture APC that traffic from the site of injection to the local lymph node, we show that 40-50nm nanoparticles are taken up at the site of injection by dendritic cells (DCs) migrating to the draining lymph node. These DCs can express CD11c, CD1b, CD5, MHC class II and CD8. Nanoparticles transported by DCs migrating from the site of injection to the local lymph node therefore needs to be considered as a new mechanism underlying the immunogenicity of virus-sized vaccine delivery systems.
23146691	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN-induced inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) protein acts as a potent proinflammatory GENENOTIN and is involved in the pathogenesis of several vascular diseases, such as, systemic vasculitis and sepsis. CHEMICALNOTIN (EG) is a new active compound from Reynoutria japonica, and its biologic activities have not been previously investigated. In this study, we first investigated the antiinflammatory activities of EG on GENENOTIN-mediated proinflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a murine cecal ligation and puncture (CLP)-model of sepsis in mice. EG was found to suppress the release of GENENOTIN, the production of GENENOTIN, and the activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) by GENENOTIN in HUVECs, and to inhibit GENENOTIN-mediated hyperpermeability and leukocyte migration in mice. In the CLP model, GENENOTIN was highly released, but this release was prevented by EG. Furthermore, EG also increased the survival times of CLP administered mice. Collectively, this study shows EG can protect barrier integrity and inhibit GENENOTIN-mediated inflammatory responses, which suggests a potential use as a therapy for sepsis or septic shock.
20618322	Copy number variations of the human histamine H4 receptor gene are associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. BACKGROUND: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a complex genetic disease; the histamine H4 receptor (HRH4) has been shown to be related to different kinds of autoimmune disorders; and copy number variations (CNVs) have been found to be associated with various types of diseases. OBJECTIVES: To explore a possible association between HRH4 (formerly H4R) CNVs and the risk of SLE. METHODS: Genomic DNA and RNA from 340 patients with SLE and 392 healthy controls were extracted, and CNVs and mRNA levels of HRH4 were examined. RESULTS: The expression of HRH4 mRNA was significantly increased in patients with SLE compared with controls. Amplification of HRH4 copy numbers significantly increased the risk of SLE [P < 0.001, odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.50-3.40]. HRH4 amplifications also positively correlated with the incidence of arthritis (P = 0.019, OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.11-3.47), and proteinuria (P < 0.001, OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.73-5.00) and antinuclear antibody abnormalities (P < 0.001, OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.66-5.33). Deletions of HRH4 copy numbers were protective against proteinuria (P = 0.03, OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.26-0.94). CONCLUSION: CNVs of the HRH4 gene are associated with SLE.
19228178	Pharmacology of CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN/GENEIN receptor agonist: a novel therapeutic drug for sleep disorders. An estimated one-third of the general population is affected by insomnia, and this number is increasing due to more stressful working conditions and the progressive aging of society. However, current treatment of insomnia with hypnotics, GENENOTIN modulators, induces various side effects, including cognitive impairment, motor disturbance, dependence, tolerance, hangover, and rebound insomnia. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Osaka, Japan) is an orally active, highly selective CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN/GENEIN receptor agonist. Unlike the sedative hypnotics that target GENENOTIN complexes, CHEMICALIN is a chronohypnotic that acts on the CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN and GENEIN receptors, which are primarily located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the body's "master clock." As such, CHEMICALNOTIN possesses the first new therapeutic mechanism of action for a prescription insomnia medication in over three decades. CHEMICALNOTIN has demonstrated sleep-promoting effects in clinical trials, and coupled with its favorable safety profile and lack of abuse potential or dependence, this chronohypnotic provides an important treatment option for insomnia.
15843826	Antimyeloma effects of a novel synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) through inhibition of angiogenesis. In multiple myeloma (MM), the interaction between myeloma cells and bone marrow microenvironment has an important role in the pathogenesis of MM. We first examined the inducing effect of myeloma cells on migration of human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Five myeloma cell lines produced varying amounts of GENENOTIN, and migration of HUVECs was induced by coculture with myeloma cells. We next examined the inhibitory effect of a novel synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on both myeloma cells and HUVECs. CHEMICALNOTIN is specific for the GENENOTIN, and has therapeutic effects in CHEMICALNOTIN resistant acute promyelocytic leukemia. CHEMICALIN slightly inhibited the growth of both myeloma cells and HUVECs, and remarkably inhibited the growth of HUVECs stimulated by GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN showed little growth inhibition of bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs), but it markedly inhibited migration of HUVECs by cocultured myeloma cells. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN. In addition, GENEIN-induced formation of tube-like structures in vitro and neovascularization in mouse corneas were significantly inhibited by CHEMICALIN. These findings clearly demonstrate that CHEMICALNOTIN is a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis caused by the interaction between vascular endothelial cells and myeloma cells, and might be a useful therapeutic agent against MM.
9231746	Mechanisms of inhibition of GENENOTIN by dihydropyridine calcium antagonists. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is one of the key enzymes involved in the complex interaction between the cyclic CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN second-messenger systems. GENENOTIN exists as tissue-specific isozymes, and initially these isozymes were designated according to their respective subunit molecular mass. A variety of pharmacological agents have been used to inhibit GENENOTIN, and this inhibition occurs mostly via CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent association with the proteins. We have examined the effect of CHEMICALIN GENEIN blockers CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN on GENENOTIN. The results suggest that the 63-kDa (GENEIN) and 60-kDa (GENEIN) GENEIN isozymes are inhibited by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN by partial competitive inhibition and that these two CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists appear to counteract each other. This study further demonstrates the existence of a specific site, distinct from the active site on GENENOTIN, that exhibits high-affinity binding of these drugs. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN have similar affinities for 60-kDa GENEIN isozymes but bring about different levels of enzyme inhibition, suggesting the possibility of designing specific drugs that can protect the enzyme from inhibition by CHEMICALIN GENEIN blockers.
23481176	Efficient MRI labeling of endothelial progenitor cells: Design of thiolated surface stabilized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles. The aim of this study was to design thiolated surface stabilized superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (TSS-SPIONs) for efficient internalization with high MRI sensitivity. TSS-SPIONs were developed by chelation between thiolated chitosan-thioglycolic acid (chitosan-TGA) hydrogel and iron ions (Fe(2+)/Fe(3+)). Likely, unmodified chitosan hydrogel SPIONs (UC-SPIONs) and uncoated SPIONs were used as control. Moreover, TSS-SPIONs were investigated regarding to their iron core size, hydrodynamic diameter, zeta potential, iron contents, molar relaxivities (r1 and r2), and cellular internalization. TSS-SPIONs demonstrated an iron oxide core diameter (crystallite size by XRD) of 3.1Â±0.02nm, a hydrodynamic diameter of 94Â±20nm, a zeta potential of +21Â±5mV, and an iron content of 3.6Â±0.9mg/mL. In addition, internalization of TSS-SPIONs into human endothelial progenitor cells (EPC) from umbilical cord blood was more than threefold and 17-fold higher in contrast to UC-SPIONs and SPIONs, respectively. With twofold lower incubation iron concentration of TSS-SPIONs, more than threefold higher internalization was achieved as compared to ResovistÂ®. Also, cell viability of more than 90% was observed in the presence of TSS-SPIONs after 24h. The molar MR relaxivities (r2) value at 1.5T was threefold higher than that of ResovistÂ® and demonstrated that TSS-SPIONs have the potential as very effective T2 contrast-enhancement agent. According to these findings, TSS-SPIONs with efficient internalization, lower cytotoxicity, and high MRI sensitivity seem to be promising for cell tracking.
23260346	Selective inhibitors and tailored activity probes for GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN binds to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) particles, where it is thought to hydrolyze oxidatively truncated phospholipids. GENENOTIN has also been implicated as a pro-tumorigenic enzyme in human prostate cancer. Several inhibitors of GENEIN have been described, including CHEMICALIN, which is currently in phase 3 clinical development for the treatment of atherosclerosis. The selectivity that CHEMICALNOTIN and other GENENOTIN inhibitors display across the larger GENENOTIN family has not, however, been reported. Here, we describe the use of both general and tailored activity-based probes for profiling GENENOTIN and inhibitors of this enzyme in native biological systems. We show that both CHEMICALIN and a novel class of structurally distinct CHEMICALIN inhibitors inactivate GENEIN in mouse tissues and human cell lines with high selectivity. Our findings thus identify both inhibitors and chemoproteomic probes that are suitable for investigating GENENOTIN function in biological systems.
14725487	CHEMICALNOTIN: CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN-sepracor, CHEMICALNOTIN-sepracor, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN. Sepracor in the US is developing CHEMICALNOTIN [CHEMICALNOTIN], a single isomer form of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN]. This isomer contains two chiral centres and is being developed as an inhaled preparation for the treatment of respiratory disorders. Sepracor believes that CHEMICALNOTIN has the potential to be a once-daily therapy with a rapid onset of action and a duration of effect exceeding 12 hours. In 1995, Sepracor acquired New England Pharmaceuticals, a manufacturer of metered-dose and dry powder inhalers, for the purpose of preparing formulations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Phase II dose-ranging clinical studies of CHEMICALNOTIN as a longer-acting, complementary bronchodilator were completed successfully in the fourth quarter of 2000. Phase III trials of CHEMICALNOTIN began in September 2001. The indications for the drug appeared to be asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, an update of the pharmaceutical product information on the Sepracor website in September 2003 listed COPD maintenance therapy as the only indication for CHEMICALNOTIN. In October 2002, Sepracor stated that two pivotal phase III studies were ongoing in 1600 patients. Sepracor estimates that its NDA submission for CHEMICALNOTIN, which is projected for the first half of 2004, will include approximately 3000 adult subjects. Sepracor stated in July 2003 that it had completed more than 100 preclinical studies and initiated or completed 15 clinical studies for CHEMICALNOTIN inhalation solution for the treatment of bronchospasm in patients with COPD. In addition, Sepracor stated that the two pivotal phase III studies in 1600 patients were still progressing. In 1995, European patents were granted to Sepracor for the use of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of asthma, and the US patent application was pending.
23402364	Role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the chemistry and anticancer activity of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Originally identified as an innate cytotoxin, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) formation in tumors can influence chemotherapy and exacerbate cancer progression. Here, we examined the hypothesis that CHEMICALNOTIN generation contributes to cancer cell drug resistance toward the widely used anticancer drug CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). The UV-vis spectrum of CHEMICALNOTIN was not changed by exposure of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN in aqueous buffer. In contrast, reddish-orange compound(s) characteristic of CHEMICALNOTIN were readily generated in a hydrophobic medium (CHEMICALNOTIN) in an CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent manner. Similar products were also formed when the CHEMICALNOTIN radical, generated from CHEMICALNOTIN and horseradish peroxidase/CHEMICALNOTIN, was exposed directly to CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. Separation and spectral analysis of CHEMICALNOTIN reaction extracts by electron spin resonance and UV-vis indicated the generation of the CHEMICALNOTIN radical and the CHEMICALNOTIN of CHEMICALNOTIN, as well as putative CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and other CHEMICALNOTIN intermediates. CHEMICALNOTIN products of CHEMICALIN displayed significantly diminished GENEIN-dependent cleavage of DNA and cytotoxicity to human HL-60 leukemia cells. LPS-mediated induction of GENENOTIN in murine macrophages resulted in CHEMICALNOTIN resistance compared to Raw cells. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN products derived from GENENOTIN rapidly reacted with CHEMICALNOTIN leading to decreased DNA damage and cytotoxicity. Together, these observations suggest that the formation of CHEMICALNOTIN in tumors (associated macrophages) can contribute to CHEMICALNOTIN resistance via the detoxification of CHEMICALNOTIN.
11319232	GENENOTIN are present in different subcellular membranes in rat liver and can be inhibited independently. Inhibition studies have suggested that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, EC ) isoforms might regulate the use of CHEMICALNOTIN by different metabolic pathways. In order to determine whether the subcellular locations differed for each of the three GENENOTIN present in liver and whether these isoforms were regulated independently, non-cross-reacting peptide antibodies were raised against GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN was identified in endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM), and cytosol, but not in mitochondria. GENENOTIN was present primarily in MAM, and the 76-kDa GENENOTIN protein was located in mitochondrial membrane. Consistent with these locations, CHEMICALIN, an inhibitor of GENEIN, inhibited GENEIN activity 47% in MAM and 28% in endoplasmic reticulum. CHEMICALIN, a second GENEIN inhibitor, inhibited GENEIN activity <10% in microsomes and mitochondria and 45% in MAM. CHEMICALIN, a competitive inhibitor of both GENEIN and GENEIN, inhibited GENEIN activity similarly in endoplasmic reticulum, MAM, and mitochondria, suggesting that a hitherto unidentified CHEMICALIN-sensitive GENEIN is present in mitochondria. GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN were regulated independently by fasting and re-feeding. Fasting rats for 48 h resulted in a decrease in GENENOTIN protein, and an increase in GENENOTIN. Re-feeding normal chow or a high CHEMICALIN diet for 24 h after a 48-h fast increased both GENEIN and GENEIN protein expression 1.5-2.0-fold, consistent with inhibition studies. These results suggest that GENEIN and GENEIN may be linked to CHEMICALIN synthesis. Taken together, the data suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN may be functionally channeled to specific metabolic pathways through different GENENOTIN isoforms in unique subcellular locations.
11585753	The GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN ("CHEMICALIN") inhibits GENEIN-driven signaling and suppresses the growth of GENEIN-overexpressing tumor cells. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is commonly overexpressed in many human tumors and provides a new target for anticancer drug development. CHEMICALIN ("CHEMICALIN"), a CHEMICALIN kinase inhibitor selective for the GENEIN, has shown good activity in preclinical studies and in the early phase of clinical trials. However, because it remains unclear which tumor types are the best targets for treatment with this agent, the molecular characteristics that correlate with tumor sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN have been studied. In a panel of human breast cancer and other epithelial tumor cell lines, GENEIN-overexpressing tumors were particularly sensitive to CHEMICALIN. Growth inhibition of these tumor cell lines was associated with the dephosphorylation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, accompanied by the loss of association of HER3 with GENEIN, and down-regulation of GENENOTIN activity. These studies suggest that GENENOTIN-overexpressing tumors are particularly susceptible to the inhibition of GENENOTIN family GENEIN signaling and suggest novel strategies to treat these particularly aggressive tumors.
23537582	Integrated chemical and biological analysis to explain estrogenic potency in bile extracts of red mullet (Mullus barbatus). A biological screening was performed to establish the total exposure to estrogenic compounds of red mullet (Mullus barbatus) collected at several sites along the Spanish Mediterranean coast by testing male fish bile extracts using the in vitro ER-LUC reporter gene assay. In addition, major metabolites were identified and measurements of OH-PAHs (1-naphthol, 9-phenantrol, 9-fluorenol, 1-pyrenol, 1OH-BaP and 3OH-BaP) and alkylphenols (4-n-nonylphenol (4-n-NP) and 4-tertoctylphenol (4-tert-OP)) in the same fish bile extracts were taken by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in electron ionization mode (GC-EI-MS). Relative in vitro estrogenic potencies of the chemically quantified compounds were also tested. The highest biliary concentrations of 1-pyrenol, 9-fluorenol and 4-n-NP were found in fish from Barcelona and from the Mar Menor coastal lagoon. However, these concentrations can be considered relatively low compared to values reported in red mullet from other polluted waters in the Mediterranean Sea. The contribution of 1-pyrenol, 4-n-NP and 4-tert-OP to the total estrogenic potency measured in male fish bile was found to be negligible, indicating the presence of other estrogenic compounds in red mullet bile. Estrogenic potency in bile from male fish was markedly elevated in Mar Menor lagoon (234.8Â±5.7pgE2EQ/Î¼l), and further research will be necessary to explain whether the presence of natural and synthetic-hormones in the lagoon contributed to this finding. Values of approximately 15-16E2EQpg/mg bile can be regarded as preliminary baseline levels of bile estrogenicity in male red mullet from the western Mediterranean Sea.
19068776	[Pharmacological effects of a GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN on CHEMICALNOTIN dependence]. CHEMICALNOTIN is one of the most commonly abused substances, and its chronic intake leads to the development of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence in both humans and laboratory animals. In many countries, a GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN has been used in the treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence. The introduction of CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN dependence has been mainly based on behavioral animal models that provide evidence of the involvement of the endogenous opioid system in CHEMICALNOTIN drinking and dependence. It has been well known that CHEMICALNOTIN leads to the activation of the endogenous opioid system. The endogenous opioid agonists, such as GENENOTIN, increase the activity of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system through the inhibition of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-containing inhibitory interneurons in the ventral tegmental area, resulting in the expression of CHEMICALNOTIN reinforcement and/or rewarding effect. Therefore, CHEMICALNOTIN, which is useful for CHEMICALNOTIN dependence therapy, may attenuate the rewarding effect of CHEMICALNOTIN by interfering with the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced stimulation of the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. The following review provides a summary of the interactions between endogenous opioid system and mesolimbic dopaminergic system in CHEMICALNOTIN dependence.
12373423	Re-evaluation of CHEMICALNOTIN pharmacology: GENENOTIN-mediated behavioral effects overlap its other properties in rats. RATIONALE: There is substantial evidence that CHEMICALIN can produce effects linked to GENEIN receptor occupancy. Nevertheless, this action has generally been ignored in the mechanism of action of CHEMICALIN, in favor of an exclusive role for GENEIN in considering its antiparkinsonian effects, or an exclusive role of GENENOTIN receptor activation in hallucinogenesis. These conclusions are surprising when one considers that the potent interaction of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN receptors has been demonstrated in several different laboratories and that activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors can modulate dopaminergically mediated responses. OBJECTIVE: The lack of full substitution of CHEMICALNOTIN for CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in drug discrimination experiments and induction of a pronounced CHEMICALNOTIN syndrome by this compound at relatively low doses convinced us to execute two series of experiments that might explain the primary mechanism responsible for CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated biological effects and its paradoxical classification as a CHEMICALNOTIN agonist in the literature. RESULTS: In drug discrimination studies, CHEMICALIN fully mimicked the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN, only partially substituted for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and failed to substitute for CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN produced a significant dose-related increase in flat body posture, forepaw treading, and lower-lip retraction which reflect a modulation of behavior by action at central GENEIN receptors. Only pMPPI [CHEMICALIN], a selective GENEIN antagonist, was effective in inhibiting all CHEMICALNOTIN syndrome behaviors produced by CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas pMPPI was without effect on any behavior induced by CHEMICALNOTIN. Lisuride dose dependently decreased body temperature in rats with a potency similar to that of the selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN. The hypothermic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was prevented by pre-injection of pMPPI, but not by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of low doses of CHEMICALIN are clearly mediated by stimulation of GENEIN receptors.
12183670	CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked [CHEMICALNOTIN]overflow from rat striatal slices preloaded with CHEMICALNOTIN and from rat hippocampal slices preloaded with CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN, an efficacious antidepressant and smoking cessation agent, inhibits GENENOTIN (GENEIN and GENEIN, respectively). Recently, CHEMICALNOTIN has been reported to noncompetitively inhibit GENENOTIN expressed in Xenopus oocytes or established cell lines. The present study evaluated CHEMICALNOTIN-induced inhibition of native GENENOTIN using functional neurotransmitter release assays, CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked [CHEMICALNOTIN]overflow from superfused rat striatal slices preloaded with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), and CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked [CHEMICALNOTIN]overflow from hippocampal slices preloaded with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). The mechanism of inhibition was evaluated using Schild analysis. To eliminate the interaction of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN or GENEIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively, was included in the superfusion buffer. A high CHEMICALNOTIN concentration (100 microM) elicited intrinsic activity in the CHEMICALNOTIN release assay. However, none of the concentrations (1 nM-100 microM) examined evoked CHEMICALNOTIN overflow and, thus, were without intrinsic activity in this assay. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited both CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked CHEMICALNOTIN overflow (IC(50) = 1.27 microM) and CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked CHEMICALNOTIN overflow (IC(50) = 323 nM) at CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations well below those eliciting intrinsic activity. Results from Schild analyses suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN competitively inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked CHEMICALNOTIN overflow, whereas evidence for receptor reserve was obtained upon assessment of CHEMICALNOTIN inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked CHEMICALNOTIN overflow. Thus, CHEMICALIN acts as an antagonist at GENENOTIN in rat striatum and hippocampus, respectively, across the same concentration range that inhibits GENEIN and GENEIN function. The combination of GENEIN and transporter inhibition produced by CHEMICALIN may contribute to its clinical efficacy as a smoking cessation agent.
23085435	CHEMICALIN-containing CHEMICALIN induce apoptosis of hematopoietic tumor cells via inhibition of GENEIN signaling pathways and GENEIN-mediated activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. CHEMICALIN-containing CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN) induce apoptosis in tumor cells by inhibiting the prenylation of small GENEIN. However, the details of the apoptosis-inducing mechanism remain obscure. The present study showed that the induction of apoptosis by CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN in hematopoietic tumor cells is mediated by mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathways, which are activated by the suppression of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) biosynthesis. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN decreased the levels of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN via suppression of GENEIN prenylation and enhanced GENEIN expression. The present results indicated that CHEMICALIN-CHEMICALIN induce apoptosis by decreasing the mitochondrial transmembrane potential, increasing the activation of GENEIN and GENEIN, and enhancing GENEIN expression through inhibition of the GENEIN/GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN pathways. The accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN in bones suggests that they may act more effectively on tumors that have spread to bones or on GENENOTIN-variable tumors. This is the first study to show that the specific molecular pathways of CHEMICALNOTIN-BP-induced apoptosis.
23600800	GENENOTIN is a new intracellular modulator of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN of sensory ganglion neurons are important transducers of painful stimuli and are modulated by extracellular algogenic substances, via changes in the receptor phosphorylation state. The present study investigated the role of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in interacting and controlling GENENOTIN expression and function in mouse trigeminal ganglia. Most ganglion neurons in situ or in culture co-expressed GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN was immunoprecipitated with GENENOTIN receptors from trigeminal ganglia and from GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-cotransfected HEK cells. Recombinant GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN expression in HEK cells increased CHEMICALIN phosphorylation of GENEIN receptors, typically associated with receptor upregulation. GENENOTIN deletion mutants also enhanced GENENOTIN subunit expression. After silencing GENENOTIN, cell surface GENENOTIN receptor expression was decreased, which is consistent with depressed GENENOTIN currents. The reduction of GENEIN expression levels was reversed by the proteasomal inhibitor CHEMICALIN. Moreover, neuronal GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interaction was upregulated by GENENOTIN signaling and downregulated by GENENOTIN agonist-induced desensitization. These data suggest a novel interaction between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors with positive outcome for receptor stability and function. As GENENOTIN-mediated control of GENENOTIN receptors was dependent on the receptor activation state, GENENOTIN represents an intracellular gateway to regulate purinergic nociceptive signaling.

20104269	Bile acids induce GENENOTIN expression through the GENENOTIN in gastric epithelial cells. Clinical and experimental studies showed that the reflux of bile into the stomach contributes to the induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach and gastric carcinogenesis. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) plays a key role in the exhibition of intestinal phenotypes by regulating the expression of intestine-specific genes such as goblet-specific gene GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). We investigated the involvement of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a GENENOTIN for bile acids, in the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-induced expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in normal rat gastric epithelial cells (RGM-1 cells). RGM-1 cells were treated with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN agonist, in the presence or absence of CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN antagonist. CHEMICALIN induced dose-dependent expression of GENEIN and GENEIN at both the mRNA and protein levels. The maximum stimulation of GENEIN and GENEIN mRNA induced by CHEMICALIN was observed at 3 h and by 6 h, respectively. CHEMICALNOTIN also induced expression of these molecules. The effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN on expression of GENEIN and GENEIN were abolished by CHEMICALIN. These findings suggest that bile acids may induce gastric intestinal metaplasia and carcinogenesis through the GENENOTIN.
12213053	CHEMICALIN analogues as potential inhibitors of the GENEIN at the GENEIN. A series of CHEMICALIN (2) and CHEMICALIN (3) analogues with a variety of electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups in the pendant CHEMICALIN group and the CHEMICALIN ring C, as well as H, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN groups replacing the CHEMICALIN group were synthesized, and their binding affinities at the GENEIN (GENEIN) on rat or guinea pig striatal membranes were determined. Several active analogues were also evaluated for their ability to block uptake of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN and inhibit binding of CHEMICALIN at HEK-GENEIN, HEK-GENEIN, and HEK-GENEIN cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (26) was found to be a pro-drug, oxidizing (CHEMICALNOTIN --> CHEMICALNOTIN) to CHEMICALNOTIN on rat striatal membranes and HEK-GENENOTIN cells. The CHEMICALIN analogue (38) of CHEMICALIN was the most potent and selective ligand for HEK-GENEIN cells (GENEIN K(i) = 1.1 nM; GENEIN/GENEIN = 1283 and GENEIN/GENEIN = 38). Experimental results strongly favor the cyclic or ol tautomers of 2 and 3 to bind more tightly at the GENENOTIN than the corresponding keto tautomers.
16547651	Herbicidal inhibitors of CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis and herbicide-tolerant crops. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors interfere with CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis by inhibiting GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN affects CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis by inhibiting GENEIN (GENEIN). CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN and blocks biosynthesis of CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN gene variants that confer tolerance to GENENOTIN inhibitors have been discovered in plants through selection or mutagenesis. CHEMICALNOTIN-tolerant crops have been commercialized based on these GENENOTIN gene variants. A modified GENENOTIN gene and CP4-GENENOTIN gene from Agrobacterium sp. have been used to transform plants for target-based tolerance to CHEMICALNOTIN. A GENENOTIN gene isolated from Ochrobactrum anthropi has also been employed to encode GENENOTIN to detoxify CHEMICALNOTIN in plants. CHEMICALNOTIN-tolerant crops with GENENOTIN transgene alone or both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transgenes have been commercialized. Similarly, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes isolated from Streptomyces hygroscopicus and S. viridochromogenes, respectively, have been inserted into plants to encode GENENOTIN to detoxify CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN-tolerant crops have been commercialized using one of these two transgenes.
23579178	Mechanisms of CHEMICALNOTIN Lowering of GENEIN Inhibitor CHEMICALIN When Used Alone or With CHEMICALNOTIN in Type 2 Diabetes: A double-tracer study. OBJECTIVETo assess CHEMICALNOTIN-lowering mechanisms of CHEMICALNOTIN (S), CHEMICALNOTIN (M), and the two combined (M+S).RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe randomized 16 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to four 6-week treatments with placebo (P), M, S, and M+S. After each period, subjects received a 6-h meal tolerance test (CHEMICALNOTIN) with CHEMICALNOTIN to calculate CHEMICALNOTIN kinetics. Fasting plasma CHEMICALNOTIN (FPG), fasting plasma GENENOTIN, GENEIN (GENENOTIN secretory rate [ISR]), fasting plasma GENENOTIN, and bioactive GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was measured.RESULTSFPG decreased from P, 160 Â± 4 to M, 150 Â± 4; S, 154 Â± 4; and M+S, 125 Â± 3 mg/dL. Mean post-CHEMICALNOTIN PG decreased from P, 207 Â± 5 to M, 191 Â± 4; S, 195 Â± 4; and M+S, 161 Â± 3 mg/dL (P < 0.01]. The increase in mean post-CHEMICALNOTIN plasma GENENOTIN and in ISR was similar in P, M, and S and slightly greater in M+S. Fasting plasma GENENOTIN was equal (â¼65-75 pg/mL) with all treatments, but there was a significant drop during the initial 120 min with S 24% and M+S 34% (both P < 0.05) vs. P 17% and M 16%. Fasting and mean post-CHEMICALNOTIN plasma bioactive GENENOTIN were higher (P < 0.01) after S and M+S vs. M and P. Basal endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN production (EGP) fell from P 2.0 Â± 0.1 to S 1.8 Â± 0.1 mg/kg â min, M 1.8 Â± 0.2 mg/kg â min [both P < 0.05 vs. P), and M+S 1.5 Â± 0.1 mg/kg â min (P < 0.01 vs. P). Although the EGP slope of decline was faster in M and M+S vs. S, all had comparable greater post-MTT EGP inhibition vs. P (P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONSM+S combined produce additive effects to 1) reduce FPG and postmeal PG, 2) augment GENENOTIN secretion and Î²-cell function, 3) decrease plasma GENENOTIN, and 4) inhibit fasting and postmeal EGP compared with M or S monotherapy.
23423713	Modulation of GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN in hepatic tissue and isolated hepatocyte of C57BL/6 mice. The objective of the current study was to investigate the effect of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on GENEIN expression and activity in C57BL/6 mice liver and isolated hepatocytes. For this purpose, C57BL6 mice were injected intraperitoneally with CHEMICALNOTIN (5Â mg/kg) in the absence and presence of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) (15Â Î¼g/kg) for 6 and 24Â h. Furthermore, isolated hepatocytes from C57BL6 mice were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (5, 10, and 20Â Î¼M) in the absence and presence of CHEMICALNOTIN (1 nM) for 3, 6, 12, and 24Â h. In vivo, CHEMICALIN alone did not significantly alter GENEIN, GENEIN, or GENEIN mRNA, protein, or catalytic activity levels. Upon co-exposure to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN significantly potentiated the CHEMICALIN-mediated induction of the GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels at 24Â h. In vitro, CHEMICALIN decreased the CHEMICALIN-mediated induction of GENEIN mRNA, protein, and catalytic activity levels. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN significantly inhibited the CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN-dependent luciferase activity. CHEMICALIN also increased GENEIN (GENEIN) levels in animals treated for 24Â h. Upon treatment of isolated hepatocytes with GENENOTIN alone or in the presence of CHEMICALIN, there was an increase in the GENEIN-dependent luciferase activity. When isolated hepatocytes were treated for 2Â h with CHEMICALNOTIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, followed by replacement of the medium with new medium containing GENENOTIN, there was further potentiation to the CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated effect. The present study demonstrates that there is a differential modulation of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN in C57BL/6 mice livers and isolated hepatocytes and demonstrates GENENOTIN as an in vivo specific modulator.
8600944	Glucocorticosteroids affect functions of airway- and blood-derived human T-cell clones, favoring the Th1 profile through two mechanisms. Glucocorticosteroids (CHEMICALNOTIN) are beneficial in allergic asthma. CHEMICALIN therapy results in reduced mRNA expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN in cells from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) but not of GENEIN. In vitro studies with blood-derived T cells, however, show inhibition of all three GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. We studied the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on T cells from BAL in vitro, namely Th0-, Th1, and Th2-like clones; and we compared BAL- with blood-derived clones. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) inhibited the anti-GENEIN-induced production of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in all 20 clones tested. GENENOTIN production was inhibited significantly less than GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN enhanced the ratio GENEIN/GENEIN (mean +/- SEM: control, 28.7 +/- 17.6; with 10-7 M DEX, 55.0 +/- 27.5, P<0.005). Interestingly, two categories of clones were distinguished based on the effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN production and GENEIN expression and proliferation; 1) In low GENENOTIN producers CHEMICALIN blocked GENEIN production and decreased GENEIN expression and proliferation; 2) In high GENENOTIN producers CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN production partially and enhanced GENEIN expression and proliferation. Anti-GENENOTIN and anti-GENENOTIN blocked the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increase in proliferation. High levels of added GENENOTIN induced the second type of response. In conclusion, the production of GENEIN and GENEIN by T-cell clones (derived either from BAL or blood) was more sensitive to inhibition by CHEMICALIN than that of GENEIN, which may account for the therapeutic effects of glucocorticosteroids in patients with asthma. The differential effects of CHEMICALIN on the proliferation of high and low GENEIN producers in vitro may implicate a selective outgrowth of Th1-like T cells in vivo in patients treated with CHEMICALNOTIN.
23519392	GENENOTIN Mediates Dyslipidemia Induced by the GENEIN Inhibitor CHEMICALIN in Mice. GENENOTIN inhibitors (PIs) have been used successfully in extending the lifespan of people infected with HIV. The use of PIs has also been associated with dyslipidemia and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Several PIs have been implicated to activate the nuclear receptor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), which acts as a xenobiotic sensor to regulate xenobiotic metabolism in the liver and intestine. Recent studies indicate that GENENOTIN may also play an important role in the regulation of lipid homeostasis. In the present study, we identified CHEMICALIN, a widely used HIV PI, as a potent GENEIN-selective agonist. Computational docking studies combined with site-direct mutagenesis identified several key residues within the ligand binding pocket of GENEIN that constitute points of interaction with CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN efficiently activated GENEIN and induced GENEIN target gene expression in vitro and in vivo. Short-term exposure to CHEMICALIN significantly increased plasma total CHEMICALNOTIN and atherogenic low-density lipoprotein CHEMICALNOTIN levels in wild-type mice, but not in GENEIN-deficient mice. CHEMICALIN-mediated GENEIN activation stimulated the expression of several key intestinal genes involved in lipid homeostasis. These findings provide critical mechanistic insight for understanding the impact of PIs on cardiovascular disease and demonstrate a potential role of GENENOTIN in mediating adverse effects of HIV PIs in humans.
23419036	Charge screening between anionic and cationic surfactants in ionic liquids. The aggregation and interfacial behavior of mixtures of anionic (sodium dodecylsulfate, SDS) and cationic (dodecylammonium bromide, DTAB) surfactants were investigated. A room-temperature ionic liquid (IL) was explored as a solvent for the SDS/DTAB system and compared to water. The critical micelle concentration (cmc) and composition in mixed micelles were determined for both solvents. Our experiments showed nearly ideal mixing of SDS/DTAB over the entire composition range and suggest that charge screening is prominent in ILs. This behavior is in sharp contrast to the strong electrostatic attraction and a multiphase composition gap in water. Two models by Clint and Rubingh, which describe ideal and nonideal micellar behavior, respectively, are discussed on the basis of our results. According to Rubingh's model, the composition of mixed micelles is gradually changing with the bulk composition in ILs but tends to be a 1:1 ratio in water. The results here are further support of the strong charge screening in ionic liquids.
22718571	Anti-diabetic Activity of CHEMICALNOTIN is due to an Active Metabolite, CHEMICALIN, that Upregulates GENEIN Gene Expression in 3T3-L1 cells. We have previously shown the anti-diabetic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN; however, pharmacokinetic analysis showed that CHEMICALNOTIN had a plasma half-life of 1.3 h. CHEMICALNOTIN is an active metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN that possesses a pharmacophoric moiety. The aim of this study was to explore the possibility whether the anti-diabetic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN is due to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN treatment had no significant effect on adipogenesis, or the mRNA expression of GENEIN and GENEIN; however, there was a significant increase in the mRNA expression of GENEIN. On the other hand, treatment with CHEMICALIN significantly increased adipogenesis, which was associated with a significant increase in the mRNA expression of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN. These findings suggest, for the first time, that the anti-diabetic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN is due to CHEMICALNOTIN, an active metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN. Copyright Â© 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
10443304	[Brugada syndrome]. In 1992 we described a new syndrome consisting of syncopal episodes and/or sudden death in patients with a structurally normal heart and a characteristic electrocardiogram displaying a pattern resembling right bundle branch block with an ST segment elevation in leads V1 to V3. In 1998 it was described that the disease is genetically determined with an autosomal dominant pattern of transmission. Three different mutations have been identified. All three mutations affect the structure and the function of the sodium channel SCN5A. Two mutations result in total loss of function of the sodium channel. The other mutation results in acceleration of the recovery of the sodium channel from inactivation. The disease causes 4 to 10 sudden deaths per 10,000 inhabitants per year in areas like Thailand and Laos. Up to 50% of the yearly sudden deaths in patients with a normal heart might be caused by this syndrome. The diagnosis is easily made by means of the electrocardiogram (ECG). The presence of concealed and intermittent forms, however, makes the diagnosis difficult in some patients. The ECG can be modulated by changes in autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs. Beta-adrenergic stimulation normalises the ECG, while i.v. ajmaline, flecainide or procainamide accentuate the ST segment elevation and are capable of unmasking concealed and intermittent forms of the disease. The prognosis is poor for patients who do not receive an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. Antiarrhythmic drugs like amiodarone or beta-blockers do not prevent sudden death in symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals.
23261645	The effects of CHEMICALIN on human cardiomyocyte function and GENEIN activity. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN) is a CHEMICALNOTIN that has antitumor activity. A narrow margin of safety was observed between doses required for efficacy in mouse tumor models and doses that caused severe acute toxicity in rats and dogs. We explored the hypothesis that the observed toxicity was due to cardiotoxicity. CHEMICALNOTIN was tested in a patch clamp assay to determine its effect on selected GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (10 Î¼M) inhibited Kv1.5 activity by 98.5%. CHEMICALIN also inhibited other channels including GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN; however, the GENEIN (GENEIN) channel was minimally affected. Using spontaneously contracting human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, effects on cardiomyocyte contraction and viability were also examined. CHEMICALNOTIN (30 nM to 30 Î¼M) decreased cardiomyocyte cell indices and beat amplitude, putative measurements of cell viability and cardiac contractility, respectively. Concentration-dependent increases in rhythmic beating rate were noted at â¤ 6 h of treatment, followed by dose-dependent decreases after 6 and 72 h exposure. The toxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were compared with that of the known cardiotoxicant CHEMICALNOTIN, and confirmed by multiparameter fluorescence imaging analysis. These results support the hypothesis that the toxicity observed in rats and dogs is due to toxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on cardiomyocytes.
15732037	CHEMICALIN modulates the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in a rat model of volume-overload heart failure. BACKGROUND: The use of beta-blockers has emerged as a beneficial treatment for congestive heart failure. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is tightly regulated in the ventricular myocardium. However, the expression of GENENOTIN in chronic heart failure resulting from volume overload and after treatment with beta-blocker is little known. METHODS AND RESULTS: To test the hypothesis that GENENOTIN plays a role in the failing myocardium because of volume overload, an aorta-caval shunt was created for 4 weeks in adult Sprague-Dawley rats to induce volume-overload heart failure. CHEMICALNOTIN at 50 mg/kg body weight per day after surgery was given. The heart weight and body weight ratio increased from 2.6 +/- 0.3 in the sham group to 3.9 +/- 0.7 (P < .001) in the shunt group. Left ventricular end-diastolic dimension increased from 6.5 +/- 0.5 mm to 8.7 +/- 0.6 mm (P < .001). Treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN in the shunt group reversed the heart weight and ventricular dimension to the baseline values. Western blot showed that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) proteins were upregulated and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) downregulated in the shunt group. Real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that mRNA of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN increased and mRNA of GENENOTIN decreased in the shunt group. Treatment with CHEMICALIN reversed both protein and mRNA of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN to the baseline values. Increased immunohistochemical labeling of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN in the ventricular myocardium was observed in the shunt group and CHEMICALIN again normalized the labeling. CONCLUSION: GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA and protein expression were upregulated in the rat model of volume-overload heart failure. Treatment with CHEMICALIN is associated with a reversal of abnormal regulation of GENEIN and GENEIN in the failing ventricular myocardium.
17588737	Apoptosis induced by oxidized lipids is associated with up-regulation of GENENOTIN in intestinal Caco-2 cells: protective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN compounds. In this study, we investigated the alterations of the redox balance induced by the lipid fraction of GENENOTIN in Caco-2 intestinal cells, and the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, two dietary CHEMICALNOTIN compounds. We found that oxidized lipids extracted from GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) induced oxidative stress by determining, 6 h after treatment, ROS overproduction (about a 100% and a 43% increase of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN production, respectively, P<.05: GENENOTIN vs. control) and, 12 h after treatment, GSH depletion (about a 26% decrease, P<.05: GENENOTIN vs. control), and by impairing the activities of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. In response to the induced oxidative stress, we observed significant overexpression of GENENOTIN (6 h after treatment: P<.05), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (12 h after treatment: P<.05). Notably, when GSH depletion occurred, GENENOTIN protein expression increased by about 300% with respect to control (P<.001; GENENOTIN vs. control). These effects were fully counteracted by dietary CHEMICALIN which inhibited ROS overproduction and GSH consumption, rendered the reactive transcription of CHEMICALNOTIN-associated enzymes unnecessary and blocked the intracellular signals leading to the overexpression and rearrangement of GENEIN signalling molecule. Altogether, these results suggest that the impairment of the antioxidant system hijacks intestinal cells towards an apoptotic-prone phenotype via the activation of GENENOTIN molecule. They also propose a reappraisal of dietary CHEMICALNOTIN as intestinal protecting agents, indicating the antiapoptotic effect as a further mechanism of action of these antioxidant compounds.
17499824	GENENOTIN from barley, Hordeum vulgare L., and other plant species represent a distinct eukaryotic group: gene cloning and recombinant protein characterization. Several CHEMICALNOTIN have been identified in plants. However, the biosynthetic pathway to them is unclear. In this study, we cloned and sequenced a cDNA encoding a GENEIN from barley which contained an open reading frame encoding 337 CHEMICALIN residues. The deduced CHEMICALIN sequence showed significant identity to plant and mammalian GENEIN and contained conserved CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-binding CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN-interacting CHEMICALIN residues. The purified gene product catalyzed not only racemization of CHEMICALNOTIN but also dehydration of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN. The enzyme requires CHEMICALIN and divalent cations such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas mammalian GENEIN activity is increased by CHEMICALIN. In addition to the results regarding the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on enzyme activity and the phylogenetic analysis of eukaryotic GENENOTIN, the antiserum against GENENOTIN did not form a precipitate with barley and rice GENENOTIN. This suggests that plant GENENOTIN represent a distinct group in the eukaryotic GENENOTIN family and can be clustered into monocot and dicot types.
17308037	Characterization of renal ecto-GENENOTIN. In kidneys, stimulation of GENENOTIN causes egress of CHEMICALNOTIN, conversion of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN by ecto-GENEIN, and metabolism of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN by GENEIN. Although much is known about GENENOTIN, the renal ecto-GENENOTIN remains uncharacterized. We administered CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM in the perfusate) to 12 different groups of perfused kidneys. CHEMICALNOTIN was measured in perfusate using ion trap mass spectrometry. In control kidneys (n=19), basal renal secretion rate of CHEMICALNOTIN was 0.49+/-0.08 and increased to 3.0+/-0.2 nmol CHEMICALNOTIN/g kidney weight/min during administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. A broad-spectrum GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor (CHEMICALIN, 300 microM, n=6) and an ecto-phosphodiesterase inhibitor (CHEMICALNOTIN, 1 mM, n=6) significantly attenuated CHEMICALNOTIN-induced CHEMICALNOTIN secretion by 60 and 74%, respectively. Blockade of GENEIN (CHEMICALIN, 100 microM), GENEIN [CHEMICALIN, 30 microM], GENEIN (CHEMICALIN, 10 microM; cGMP, 10 microM), GENEIN (Ro 20-1724 [CHEMICALIN], 100 microM), GENEIN and GENEIN (CHEMICALIN, 30 microM), and GENEIN [CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), 10 microM] did not alter renal ecto-GENEIN activity. Administration of a concentration (100 microM) of CHEMICALIN that blocks GENEIN inhibited ecto-GENEIN activity (by 44%). However, a lower concentration of CHEMICALIN (3 microM) that blocks GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, but not GENEIN, did not inhibit ecto-GENEIN activity. These data support the conclusion that renal ecto-GENEIN activity is not mediated by GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, or GENENOTIN and is inhibited by high concentrations of CHEMICALIN. Ecto-GENENOTIN has some pharmacological characteristics similar to PDE8.
23193186	Hyperglycemia slows embryonic growth and suppresses cell cycle via cyclin D1 and p21. In pregnant women, the diabetic condition results in a three- to fivefold increased risk for fetal cardiac malformations as a result of elevated glucose concentrations and the resultant osmotic stress in the developing embryo and fetus. Heart development before septation in the chick embryo was studied under two hyperglycemic conditions. Pulsed hyperglycemia induced by daily administration of glucose during 3 days of development caused daily spikes in plasma glucose concentration. In a second model, sustained hyperglycemia was induced with a single injection of glucose into the yolk on day 0. The sustained model raised the average plasma glucose concentration from 70 mg/dL to 180 mg/dL and led to decreased gene expression of glucose transporter GLUT1. Both models of hyperglycemia reduced embryo size, increased mortality, and delayed development. Within the heart outflow tract, reduced proliferation of myocardial and endocardial cells resulted from the sustained hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. The cell cycle inhibitor p21 was significantly increased, whereas cyclin D1, a cell cycle promoter, decreased in sustained hyperglycemia compared with controls. The evidence suggests that hyperglycemia-induced developmental delays are associated with slowed cell cycle progression, leading to reduced cellular proliferation. The suppression of critical developmental steps may underlie the cardiac defects observed during late gestation under hyperglycemic conditions.
19389876	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on the pharmacokinetic profile of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN is an GENEIN antagonist that is metabolized primarily by glucuronidation but also undergoes oxidative metabolism by GENEIN. The potential for CHEMICALIN, the archetypal strong inhibitor of GENEIN, to alter the pharmacokinetic profile of CHEMICALNOTIN and its oxidative metabolite, CHEMICALNOTIN, was assessed in an open-label, nonrandomized, 2-period, single-sequence study in 16 healthy men. Participants received a single dose of CHEMICALNOTIN 10 mg alone and after 4 days of CHEMICALNOTIN 400 mg administered once daily. In the presence of multiple doses of CHEMICALNOTIN, single-dose CHEMICALNOTIN AUC(0-infinity) estimate was increased by 35.3%, whereas C(max) was increased by 20.0%. For the CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite, AUC(0-infinity) estimate was decreased by 4.0%, whereas C(max) was decreased by 16.5%. Concomitant administration of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was well tolerated. In summary, CHEMICALIN had no clinically significant effect on the pharmacokinetics or safety profile of CHEMICALNOTIN; therefore, no changes in CHEMICALNOTIN dose should be necessary when the drug is administered concomitantly with known GENEIN inhibitors.
23606523	A Model-Based Approach to Predict Longitudinal HbA1c, Using Early Phase Glucose Data From Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients After Anti-Diabetic Treatment. Predicting late phase outcomes from early-phase findings can help inform decisions in drug development. If the measurements in early-phase differ from those in late phase, forecasting is more challenging. In this paper, we present a model-based approach for predicting glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in late phase using glucose and insulin concentrations from an early-phase study, investigating an anti-diabetic treatment. Two previously published models were used; an integrated glucose and insulin (IGI) model for meal tolerance tests and an integrated glucose-red blood cell-HbA1c (IGRH) model predicting the formation of HbA1c from the average glucose concentration (Cg,av ). Output from the IGI model was used as input to the IGRH model. Parameters of the IGI model and drug effects were estimated using data from a phase1 study in 59 diabetic patients receiving various doses of a glucokinase activator. Cg,av values were simulated according to a Phase 2 study design and used in the IGRH model for predictions of HbA1c. The performance of the model-based approach was assessed by comparing the predicted to the actual outcome of the Phase 2 study. We have shown that this approach well predicts the longitudinal HbA1c response in a 12-week study using only information from a 1-week study where glucose and insulin concentrations were measured.
23414340	Reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN to the highly toxic CHEMICALNOTIN by rats and rat liver cytosol. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), the major urinary metabolite of inorganic CHEMICALNOTIN, is weakly cytotoxic, whereas its reduced form, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), is highly toxic. Although GENEIN (GENENOTIN) and GENEIN have been shown or thought to catalyze CHEMICALIN reduction, their role in CHEMICALNOTIN reduction in vivo, or in cell extracts is uncertain. Therefore, the reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN in rats and in rat liver cytosol was studied to better understand its mechanism. To assess CHEMICALNOTIN reduction in rats, a novel procedure was devised based on following the accumulation of red blood cell (RBC)-bound CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which represents CHEMICALNOTIN, in the blood of CHEMICALNOTIN-injected anesthetized rats. These studies indicated that rats reduced CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN to a significant extent, as in 90 min 31% of the injected 50 Î¼mol/kg CHEMICALNOTIN dose was converted to CHEMICALNOTIN that was sequestered by the circulating erythrocytes. Pretreatment of rats with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) depletors (CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN) delayed the elimination of CHEMICALNOTIN and the accumulation of RBC-bound CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas the indirect GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN-oxidized CHEMICALIN was without effect. Assessment of CHEMICALNOTIN-reducing activity of rat liver cytosol revealed that reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN required cytosolic protein and CHEMICALNOTIN and was inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN reagents, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Although GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) inhibited cytosolic CHEMICALNOTIN reduction, recombinant GENENOTIN plus CHEMICALNOTIN, alone or when added to the cytosol, failed to support CHEMICALNOTIN reduction. On ultrafiltration of the cytosol through a 3 kDa filter, the reducing activity in the retentate was lost but was largely restored by CHEMICALNOTIN. Such experiments also suggested that the reducing enzyme was larger than 100 kDa and was not GENENOTIN. In summary, reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN to the highly toxic CHEMICALNOTIN in rats and rat liver cytosol is a CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent enzymatic process, yet its mechanism remains uncertain.
10480573	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, an CHEMICALNOTIN antibiotic, on the function of GENENOTIN in human stomach tumor cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), an CHEMICALNOTIN isolated from fermentation broths of Streptomyces sp. MJ672-m3, inhibited the growth in vitro of human stomach tumor SC-6 cells over 10 times more strongly than the growth of other human tumor cells, such as HeLa (cervix), T24 (bladder) and LX-1 (lung). The extent of growth inhibition by TT-B of SC-6, but not of LX-1 nor T24, was lowered in a competitive manner by raising serum concentrations in the culture medium. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the cell cycle progression of SC-6 at an early stage of the progression from G0/G1 to S. The inhibition was again competitive with serum concentrations in the culture medium. No direct inhibition of DNA synthesis was observed at the concentration range which caused the cell cycle arrest. CHEMICALNOTIN and anti-GENENOTIN (anti-GENENOTIN) were antagonistic to each other in inhibiting the cell cycle progression of SC-6 from G0/G1 to S, suggesting that the two compounds share the same target, GENENOTIN. The GENEIN activity of GENEIN was little inhibited by CHEMICALIN in a cell-free system.
19708854	Vapreotide: a somatostatin analog for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. BACKGROUND: Portal hypertension is a clinically important consequence of cirrhosis that can lead to morbidities such as variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites. All of these outcomes carry high mortality rates. There have been several drugs created to assist with endoscopic therapy for the treatment of acute variceal bleeding. Recently, vapreotide has been studied in patients to evaluate its efficacy as treatment for acute variceal hemorrhage. Although no comparisons have been made between vapreotide and other somatostatin analogues, this drug has been shown to have efficacy in the control of acute variceal bleeding as well as reducing the risk of recurrent bleeding and death, especially when started prior to endoscopy. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the literature regarding the basic science and clinical efficacy of vapreotide in acute variceal bleeding. METHODS: We used a PubMed/Medline search in order to review the literature regarding the drug, vapreotide. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Vapreotide appears to have benefit in the control of acute variceal bleeding. It is easy to administer and has few side effects, which are minor. These findings endorse the need for future trials to evaluate vapreotide and its use in acute variceal hemorrhage, a morbidity among patients with cirrhosis.
16757355	CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), a dual-action inhibitor that targets GENEIN/GENEIN/GENEIN pathway in tumor cells and GENEIN GENEIN/GENEIN in tumor vasculature. Activating mutations in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were identified in several human cancers. In addition, several GENENOTIN, acting upstream of GENENOTIN, were found either mutated or overexpressed in human tumors. Because oncogenic activation of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway may lead to a sustained proliferative signal resulting in tumor growth and progression, inhibition of this pathway represents an attractive approach for cancer drug discovery. A novel class of CHEMICALIN that inhibits GENEIN GENEIN was discovered using a combination of medicinal and combinatorial chemistry approaches. This effort culminated in the identification of the clinical candidate CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN), which has recently been approved by the FDA for advanced renal cell carcinoma in phase III clinical trials. CHEMICALIN inhibited the GENEIN activity of both GENEIN and GENEIN (wild type and GENEIN mutant). It inhibited GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN phosphorylation in various cancer cell lines and tumor xenografts and exhibited potent oral antitumor activity in a broad spectrum of human tumor xenograft models. Further characterization of CHEMICALIN revealed that this molecule was a multikinase inhibitor that targeted the GENEIN family (GENEIN and GENEIN) and GENEIN family (GENEIN and GENEIN), which play key roles in tumor progression and angiogenesis. Thus, CHEMICALIN may inhibit tumor growth by a dual mechanism, acting either directly on the tumor (through inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN signaling) and/or on tumor angiogenesis (through inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN signaling). In phase I and phase II clinical trials, CHEMICALNOTIN showed limited side effects and, more importantly, disease stabilization. This agent is currently being evaluated in phase III clinical trials in renal cell and hepatocellular carcinomas.
17062721	Treatment-related osteoporosis in men with prostate cancer. The intended therapeutic effect of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) agonists is hypogonadism, a major cause of acquired osteoporosis in men. Consistent with this observation, GENENOTIN agonists increase bone turnover and decrease bone mineral density, a surrogate for fracture risk. Large claims-based analyses and other retrospective studies provide compelling evidence that GENENOTIN agonists increase risk of clinical fractures. CHEMICALNOTIN play a central role in homeostasis of the normal male skeleton, and CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency rather than CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency seems to be primarily responsible for the adverse skeletal effects of GENENOTIN agonists. In randomized controlled trials, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) and selective GENEIN modulators (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) increased bone mineral density in GENENOTIN agonist-treated men. Two ongoing large randomized placebo-controlled studies will prospectively define fracture outcomes in men with prostate cancer and assess the efficacy of novel pharmacologic interventions (AMG162, CHEMICALNOTIN) during GENENOTIN agonist treatment.
23619386	CHEMICALIN allosterically inhibits the GENEIN. CHEMICALIN is a canonical allosteric inhibitor of the GENEIN GENEIN with immunosuppressive and pro-apoptotic activities. We found that in vitro CHEMICALIN also regulates the GENEIN, an essential intracellular protease of the GENEIN-GENEIN pathway. CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN and selected GENEIN activities of the catalytic core GENEIN at low micromolar concentrations. Moreover, the drug interferes with binding of the 19S cap essential for processing of polyubiquitinylated substrates, and the GENENOTIN activator to the GENENOTIN. These protein complexes are known to bind to specific grooves on the Î± face region of the 20S core. A treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN affects conformational dynamics of the proteasomal gate, a centrally positioned within the Î± face and allosterically regulated element responsible for the intake of substrates. Interestingly, we showed that CHEMICALIN shares all the GENEIN targeting properties not only with other two-domain, closed-ring analogs (rapalogs), but also with its single domain mimics, and with CHEMICALNOTIN. The latter is the first in vivo open-ring metabolite of CHEMICALIN that does not affect GENEIN. We hypothesize that the CHEMICALIN and related compounds bind to the Î± face and allosterically impact the GENEIN function. The implications of our finding for mechanism of in vivo actions of CHEMICALIN and for design of novel allosteric drugs targeting the GENEIN are discussed.
16293341	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, on melanin synthesis in humans with GENENOTIN variant alleles. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binds the GENEIN to significantly increase the eumelanin content of human skin cells. In this study of 77 Caucasian individuals, we investigated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in individuals with variant GENENOTIN genotypes, as it has been suggested through in vitro studies that variant alleles decrease CHEMICALNOTIN binding efficacy, which would subsequently affect the synthesis of melanin. Administration of CHEMICALNOTIN produced a significant (p<0.001) increase in melanin density in treated, compared to placebo, individuals. Importantly, CHEMICALNOTIN increased the melanin density to a greater extent in individuals carrying the variant alleles Val60Leu, Asp84Glu, Val92Met, Arg142His, Arg151Cys, and Arg160Trp than in individuals with no variant alleles. This study demonstrates that CHEMICALNOTIN effectively increases the melanin content of skin in those individuals with GENENOTIN variant alleles and therefore, those most in need of photoprotection.
14507109	In vitro simulation of therapeutic plasmatic fibrinolysis. One type of therapy for thromboembolism is plasmatic thrombolysis. Several GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are clinically available, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), or mutants of GENENOTIN such as reteplase (RP) or tenecteplase (TP). Therapeutic plasmatic fibrinolysis was simulated, using the GENENOTIN at relevant plasma concentrations, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN activities were determined. Normal citrated plasma was supplemented with 31 to 1,000 IU/mL u-PA, 0.31 to 20 microg/mL GENENOTIN, 125 to 4,000 IU/mL GENENOTIN, 12.5 to 400 U/mL GENENOTIN, 125 to 4,000 U/mL RP, or 0.31 to 10 microg/mL TP. Ten IU/mL GENENOTIN was also incubated with pooled plasma of stroke patients, that was previously oxidized with the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) donor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), to destroy GENEIN and alpha2-antiGENEIN. After 0 to 80 minutes (37 degrees C), 50-microL samples were withdrawn and added to 100 microL 1.5 M CHEMICALNOTIN, pH 8.7, and oxidized with 50 microL of 20 mM CHEMICALNOTIN. For determination of GENEIN activity, 10 microL thereof was incubated with 150 microL 1.5 M CHEMICALIN, pH 8.7, and 100 microL 20 mM CHEMICALNOTIN preoxidized (15 minutes 37 degrees C) pooled normal CHEMICALNOTIN buffered CHEMICALNOTIN-plasma for 30 minutes (37 degrees C). For determination of [GENEIN+GENEIN]-activity, CHEMICALIN was added after this incubation. 25-microL 6 mM CHEMICALNOTIN-pNA were added and deltaA/h at room temperature (RT) was monitored, using a microtiterplate reader. [GENENOTIN+GENENOTIN]-GENENOTIN = GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN concentration required to induce 25% [ED25] of the maximally inducible GENENOTIN-activity in plasma (= 1 U/mL = 45 mg/L = 0.53 micromol/L active GENENOTIN; deltaA = 363 +/- 8 mA/h RT) after 10 minutes (37 degrees C) were 320 IU/mL GENENOTIN, 8 microg/mL GENENOTIN, 140 U/mL PSAC, 6,000 IU/mL SK, 720 U/mL RP, and approximately 150 microg/mL TP. The approximate activity half-lives of the GENENOTIN in plasma were 30 minutes for GENENOTIN, 30 minutes for GENENOTIN, greater than 80 minutes for GENENOTIN, greater than 80 minutes for GENENOTIN, 50 minutes for RP, and 80 minutes for TP. The present study shows--for the first time--a combined kinetic in vitro simulation of the plasmatic activity of six different GENENOTIN. At clinically used concentrations, RP induces the highest GENENOTIN activity. Due to unselective generation of GENENOTIN in plasma, all GENENOTIN are of some danger in inducing severe hemorrhagias. Clinical thrombolysis might be improved by usage of more physiologic activators of thrombolysis, such as activators of polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
23019274	Novel assays for detection of urinary KIM-1 in mouse models of kidney injury. Kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1) has been qualified by the Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency as a urinary biomarker to monitor preclinical nephrotoxicity in rats and on a case-by-case basis for the translation of potentially nephrotoxic drugs into first-in human studies. Although mouse models are widely employed in preclinical studies, few urinary biomarker studies have been performed in mice due to limited urine availability and lack of sensitive assays. Here, we report the development and validation of two different assays for quantitative assessment of mouse urinary KIM-1 (uKIM-1) and compare the sensitivity of KIM-1 relative to other standard markers in ischemia reperfusion and aristolochic acid (AA)-induced kidney injury in mice. A sensitive, reproducible, and quantitative microbead-based KIM-1 ELISA was established, which requires only 10 Î¼l urine for triplicate determination with an assay range of 12.21 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml. The second assay is a laminar flow dipstick assay, which has an assay range of 195 pg/ml to 50 ng/ml and provides quantitative assessment of KIM-1 in 15 min. uKIM-1 levels increased with increasing time of ischemia or time after AA administration. After only 10-min ischemia followed by 24-h reperfusion, uKIM-1 was significantly elevated by 13-fold, whereas serum creatinine (sCr), blood urea nitrogen, N-acetyl-Î²-glucosaminidase (NAG), and proteinuria levels did not change. After AA administration, uKIM-1 levels were significantly upregulated by greater than threefold within 12 h, whereas sCr and NAG levels were unchanged. Mouse KIM-1 was stable for multiple freeze-thaw cycles, for up to 5 days at room temperature and up to at least an year when stored at -80Â°C.
17597612	Impaired antibody synthesis after spinal cord injury is level dependent and is due to sympathetic nervous system dysregulation. Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are highly susceptible to infection. This post-traumatic immune suppression is thought to occur via alterations in sympathetic nervous system (SNS) or hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function. Normally, the HPA axis and SNS help coordinate proper immune function. After SCI, the HPA axis becomes activated and descending input to sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs) is impaired. Because lymphoid organs are innervated by SPNs distributed throughout the thoracolumbar spinal cord, we predicted level-dependent immune suppression after SCI due to activation of the HPA axis and loss of descending input to SPNs. We tested this hypothesis by measuring indices of HPA (circulating CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN) and SNS function (CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in spleen) as well as antigen-specific antibody synthesis against an exogenous non-self protein following high- or low-level SCI. Using a mid-thoracic (T9) spinal contusion injury model, we found that CHEMICALNOTIN was elevated after SCI with aberrant patterns of diurnal CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis evident through at least the first 24 h post-injury. However, splenic CHEMICALNOTIN and antibody synthesis were similar to uninjured controls. Injury severity did not change these parameters. Indeed, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and antibody synthesis were similar after T9 contusion or transection SCI. In contrast, high-level SCI (T3) caused sustained increases in CHEMICALNOTIN and splenic CHEMICALNOTIN along with impaired antibody synthesis and elevated splenocyte apoptosis. The immunosuppressive effects of T3 SCI were caused by CHEMICALIN acting at GENEIN (GENEIN) and could be reversed using GENENOTIN blockers. Interestingly, impaired antibody after T3 SCI could be mimicked after T9 SCI with a GENENOTIN agonist. These data illustrate the immunosuppressive effects of the SNS after high-level SCI and indicate that immune deficits may be overcome using beta-blockers.
12957216	CHEMICALNOTIN facilitates memory retrieval in rats: possible involvement of noradrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms. Although disturbed memory function often coexists with psychosis, the cognitive effects of antipsychotic medications with diverse pharmacodynamic properties are rarely investigated. The neurocognitive profile of CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN dopaminergic antagonist and a conventional neuroleptic agent, has yet to be investigated despite the effect of the drug on a variety of neurotransmitter systems involved in mediation of learning and memory processes. In this study, the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was tested on memory retrieval 24 h after training using an inhibitory avoidance task in rats. Acute administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) before retrieval testing increased step-through latency during the test session. The same doses of CHEMICALNOTIN did not affect the ambulatory activity of rats in the openfield test and therefore the facilitatory effect of the drug on memory function could not be confounded with any motoric properties. This study also investigated the effect of CHEMICALIN on cortical and hippocampal monoaminergic neurotransmitters' levels together with GENEIN enzyme (GENEIN) activity, both of which are known to be important in control of cognitive function. Administration of CHEMICALIN (0.7 and 1.4 mg/kg i.p.) neither affected CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) level nor GENEIN activity in rat cortex and hippocampus. On the other hand, the lower dose of CHEMICALNOTIN elevated cortical CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) level, while the higher dose elevated both cortical and hippocampal CHEMICALNOTIN level together with hippocampal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) level. These results may suggest the involvement of adrenergic and serotonergic mechanisms in the facilitatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on retrieval memory. CHEMICALNOTIN may therefore be a better alternative than other commonly used antipsychotic medications reported to impair cognitive function of schizophrenic patients.
23616352	Selective Bisubstrate Inhibitors with Sub-nanomolar Affinity for GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Potent and selective: The unique nature of the CHEMICALIN binding pocket structure of GENEIN family GENEIN (GENEIN) was used for the development of bisubstrate inhibitors and a fluorescent probe with sub-nanomolar affinity. Conjugates of CHEMICALNOTIN-rich peptides with two CHEMICALNOTIN mimetic scaffolds were synthesized and tested as inhibitors of GENENOTIN. Against a panel of 124 GENENOTIN, a novel ARC-GENENOTIN conjugate selectively inhibited GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN family.
23291559	GENENOTIN GENENOTIN specifically activates the two-pore GENENOTIN GENENOTIN gene in male mouse livers, which attenuates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatic hyperplasia. GENEIN, a member of the family of two-pore GENEIN, is specifically induced in the livers of male mice after CHEMICALIN treatment. Here, we have determined the molecular mechanism of this male-specific activation of the GENEIN gene and characterized GENEIN as a CHEMICALIN-inducible antihyperplasia factor. Upon activation by CHEMICALIN, GENEIN GENEIN binds the 97-bp response element (-2441/-2345) within the GENENOTIN. This binding is observed in the livers of male mice, but not in the livers of female mice and requires the pituitary gland, because hypophysectomy abrogates it. Hyperplasia further progressed in the livers of GENENOTIN ( -/- ) male mice compared with those of GENENOTIN ( +/+ ) males after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Thus, GENENOTIN suppresses CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hyperplasia. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN treatment induces GENEIN to elicit a male-specific and growth-suppressing signal. Thus, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN ( -/- ) mice provide an experimental tool for further investigation into the molecular mechanism of GENENOTIN-mediated promotion of the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in mice.
23294255	Development of new cyclic plasmin inhibitors with excellent potency and selectivity. The trypsin-like serine protease plasmin is a target for the development of antifibrinolytic drugs for use in cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass or organ transplantations to reduce excessive blood loss. The optimization of our recently described substrate-analogue plasmin inhibitors, which were cyclized between their P3 and P2 side chains, provided a new series with improved efficacy and excellent selectivity. The most potent inhibitor 8 binds to plasmin with an inhibition constant of 0.2 nM, whereas K(i) values >1 Î¼M were determined for nearly all other tested trypsin-like serine proteases, with the exception of trypsin, which is also inhibited in the nanomolar range. Docking studies revealed a potential binding mode in the widely open active site of plasmin that explains the strong potency and selectivity profile of these inhibitors. The dialkylated piperazine-linker segment contributes to an excellent solubility of all analogues. Based on their overall profile the presented inhibitors are well suited for further development as injectable antifibrinolytic drugs.
17016711	Different responses to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in the same depressed patients. RATIONALE: Patients with major depression show hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, but the mechanisms underlying this abnormality are still unclear. OBJECTIVES: We have compared two synthetic glucorticoids, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, in their ability to suppress the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in depressed patients. CHEMICALIN probes GENEIN (GENEIN) function, while CHEMICALIN probes both GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN) function. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used a single-blind, repeated-measure design. We administered placebo, CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg) or CHEMICALNOTIN (0.5 mg), at 22:00, to 18 severe, treatment-resistant depressed inpatients (15 of them with a history of childhood trauma) and 14 healthy volunteers. On the following days, we collected salivary CHEMICALNOTIN from 9:00 to 22:00. RESULTS: Depressed patients had higher salivary CHEMICALNOTIN levels compared with controls, at baseline and after both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (p<0.001). Consistent with previous studies, depressed inpatients showed impaired suppression by CHEMICALNOTIN: based on the analysis of the areas under the curve (AUCs), suppression by CHEMICALNOTIN (0.5 mg) was -85% in controls vs -46% in depressed patients (p=0.018). However, the same depressed patients showed normal suppression by CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg): suppression was -41% in controls and -36% in depressed patients (p=0.6). CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that the additional effects of CHEMICALIN on the GENEIN explain the different responses to these glucocorticoids in the same depressed patients.
23623751	Adolescence CHEMICALNOTIN treatment in a rodent model of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder: GENENOTIN function and cellular distribution in adulthood. Attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is attributed to dysfunction of the prefrontal cortex. CHEMICALIN, an inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN, respectively), is a standard treatment for ADHD. The Spontaneously Hypertensive Rat (SHR) is a well-established animal model of ADHD. Our previous results showed that CHEMICALIN treatment in adolescent SHR enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration during adulthood, and alterations in GENEIN function in prefrontal cortex play a role in this response. Importantly, prefrontal cortex subregions, orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), have been shown to have distinct roles in ADHD and CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration. In the current study, SHR, Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and Wistar (WIS) rats received a therapeutically relevant dose of CHEMICALIN (1.5mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle during adolescence and then OFC and mPFC GENEIN function and cellular expression were assessed during adulthood. In both OFC and mPFC, no strain differences in Vmax or Km for CHEMICALNOTIN uptake into synaptosomes were found between vehicle-treated SHR, WKY and WIS. CHEMICALIN increased GENEIN Vmax in SHR mPFC and decreased GENEIN Vmax in WKY OFC. Also, CHEMICALIN decreased GENEIN Km in WIS OFC. Further, CHEMICALIN did not alter GENEIN cellular localization, indicating that CHEMICALIN treatment during adolescence regulated GENEIN function in SHR mPFC in a trafficking-independent manner. Thus, the increase in mPFC GENEIN function was an SHR-specific long term consequence of CHEMICALIN treatment during adolescence, which may be responsible for the treatment-induced alterations in behavior including the observed increases in CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration.
22749842	Dual inhibitor of PDE7 and GSK-3-VP1.15 acts as antipsychotic and cognitive enhancer in C57BL/6J mice. Cognitive deficit is a core of schizophrenia and it is not effectively treated by the available antipsychotic drugs, hence new and more effective therapy is needed. Schizophrenia is considered as a pathway disorder where Disrupted-In-Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1) is important molecular player that regulates multiple cellular cascades. We recently reported synergistic action between phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4) and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) as DISC1 interacting proteins. In the current study we characterized behavioural effects of a newly developed compound, VP1.15 that inhibits both PDE7 and GSK-3 with main focus on its antipsychotic and cognitive capacities. VP1.15 reduced ambulation in C57BL/6J mice in a dose-dependent manner (7.5 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, respectively) and, hence, lower dose was chosen for the further analysis. VP1.1.5 facilitated pre-pulse inhibition (PPI), reversed amphetamine- but not MK-801-induced PPI deficit. The drug was able to ameliorate the disrupted latent inhibition (LI) induced by the increased number of conditioning trials and reversed amphetamine-induced LI deficit, supporting further its antipsychotic effects. The drug also significantly improved episodic memory in the spatial object recognition test, facilitated working memory in Y-maze and enhanced cued fear memory, but had no effect on executive function in the Puzzle box and contextual fear conditioning. Taken together, VP1.15 elicited antipsychotic effects and also facilitated cognitive domains in mice, suggesting that multitarget drugs, affecting molecular substrates from the same pathway, perhaps could be antipsychotics of new-generation that open a new possibilities in drug discoveries. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
10340919	Comparison of inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on human CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis after single doses and at steady state. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the extent of GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibition by CHEMICALIN, which has been reported to preferentially inhibit GENEIN (GENEIN). The effects of CHEMICALIN were compared with those of CHEMICALIN, a nonselective GENEIN inhibitor. METHODS: GENEIN inhibition was determined by measuring CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-generation from clotting whole blood ex vivo after single oral doses of 7.5 and 15 mg CHEMICALIN and 75 mg CHEMICALIN and at steady state (15 mg CHEMICALIN daily and 150 mg CHEMICALIN daily). The effect was expressed as percentage inhibition of serum CHEMICALNOTIN generation and was directly related to the serum drug concentration with use of a standard sigmoidal E(max) model. RESULTS: In terms of inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN generation, CHEMICALNOTIN was about 1 order of magnitude more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN, indicated by a CHEMICALNOTIN EC50 (concentration of drug required to cause 50% of maximum effect) that was about 10 times lower than that of CHEMICALNOTIN (EC50 CHEMICALNOTIN single doses: 37.50+/-29.64; EC50 CHEMICALNOTIN single doses: 677.50+/-189.08). However, serum concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN after administration of 15 mg were approximately 10-fold higher than those of CHEMICALNOTIN. Therefore there was no statistically significant difference in the area under the effect time curve (P = .115) and the mean effect (P = .424) between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The EC50 of both drugs was significantly higher at steady state (CHEMICALNOTIN steady state: 87.07+/-55.24 ng/mL; CHEMICALNOTIN steady state: 1850.12+/-829.93 ng/mL) than after a single dose (P < .001). CONCLUSION: These data show that CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN generation at clinically relevant doses, although less potently than CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus our data suggest that the GENEIN preference of CHEMICALIN observed in vitro may not result in clinical advantages when the higher dose of 15 mg is needed. Because of the increase in EC50 at steady state, GENENOTIN is relatively spared when the lower dose of 7.5 mg is administered.
3124610	Interleukin 2 toxin: a step toward selective immunomodulation. We have used protein engineering and recombinant DNA methodologies to genetically replace the eukaryotic cell receptor binding domain of diphtheria toxin with interleukin 2 (IL-2). The toxin-related T cell growth factor fusion gene has been cloned in Escherichia coli K12. Recombinant strains of E coli produce a 68,086 K hybrid toxin, IL-2 toxin that retains immunologic properties intrinsic to both its diphtheria toxin and IL-2 components. IL-2 toxin has been found to selectively inhibit protein synthesis in both human and murine T cell lines that bear high affinity IL-2 receptors, whereas the hybrid toxin is not active against cells that do not bear this receptor. The cytotoxic action of IL-2 toxin is specifically blocked by free IL-2 and monoclonal antibodies that bind to the p55 (Tac antigen) subunit of the high affinity IL-2 receptor. In addition, IL-2 toxin, like diphtheria toxin itself, must pass through an acidic compartment in order to deliver its adenosine diphosphate ribosyl transferase activity to the cytosol of target T cells. In a murine delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) model system, we have shown that IL-2 toxin treatment induces a marked immunosuppression.
23377618	3D Organotypic Cultures of Human HepaRG Cells: A Tool for In Vitro Toxicity Studies. Drug-induced human hepatotoxicity is difficult to predict using the current in vitro systems. In this study, long-term 3D organotypic cultures of the human hepatoma HepaRG cell line were prepared using a high-throughput hanging drop method. The organotypic cultures were maintained for 3 weeks and assessed for (1) liver specific functions, including phase I enzyme and transporter activities, (2) expression of liver-specific proteins, and (3) responses to three drugs (acetaminophen, troglitazone, and rosiglitazone). Our results show that the organotypic cultures maintain high liver-specific functionality during 3 weeks of culture. The immunohistochemistry analyses illustrate that the organotypic cultures express liver-specific markers such as albumin, CYP3A4, CYP2E1, and MRP-2 throughout the cultivation period. Accordingly, the production rates of albumin and glucose, as well as CYP2E1 activity, were significantly higher in the 3D versus the 2D cultures. Toxicity studies show that the organotypic cultures are more sensitive to acetaminophen- and rosiglitazone-induced toxicity but less sensitive to troglitazone-induced toxicity than the 2D cultures. Furthermore, the EC50 value (2.7mM) for acetaminophen on the 3D cultures was similar to in vivo toxicity. In summary, the results from our study suggest that the 3D organotypic HepaRG culture is a promising in vitro tool for more accurate assessment of acute and also possibly for chronic drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
23454149	Inhibition of angiogenesis and invasion by CHEMICALIN is mediated by downregulation of GENEIN and GENEIN through GENEIN pathway in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Invasion, either directly or via metastasis formation, is the main cause of death in cancer patients, development of efficient anti-invasive agents is an important research challenge. In order to obtain more potent inhibitors, a series of CHEMICALNOTIN analogs were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against invasion. Among the synthetic analogs tested, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, was found to be the most potent anti-invasive agent. But the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on breast cancer cells were not known. In this study, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on invasion and metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells were investigated. CHEMICALNOTIN assay showed that no obvious inhibitory or cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was found. CHEMICALNOTIN could inhibit invasion, migration and tube formation of HUVECs. Gelatin zymography showed that CHEMICALIN inhibited secretion and activity of GENEIN. Western blotting demonstrated that CHEMICALIN effectively suppressed the expression of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. These results suggested that CHEMICALIN could inhibit invasion and angiogenesis by downregulation of GENEINand GENEIN, resulting from the inhibition of GENEIN pathway. CHEMICALNOTIN might be a promising lead molecule for the anti-metastasis and serve as a therapeutic agent to inhibit breast cancer cell invasion and metastasis.
23122096	Quantitative determination of fatty acid chain composition in pork meat products by high resolution 1H NMR spectroscopy. High resolution (1)H NMR spectroscopy was proposed for the determination of the fatty acid chain profile of lipids in pork meat products during ripening. Two typical Mediterranean PDO salami produced in Calabria, a region in the Southern Italy, were chosen as a case of study. Quantitative NMR analysis provided the fatty acid chain profiles of total lipid extracts. The transesterification of total lipid extracts furnished FAME mixtures that enabled quantitation of fatty acid acyl chains in the acylglycerol and FFA portions. In all cases, oleyl chains were predominant, and high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acid chains were observed. The proposed spectroscopic method allowed also the estimation of the most important nutritional parameters of dry fermented meat products.
16365052	Identification of the regulatory region of the GENENOTIN gene in mouse liver by hydrodynamics-based gene transfection. Expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) is upregulated in the liver by dietary CHEMICALIN. Previously, 3 GENENOTIN were identified in the 5'-flanking region of the GENENOTIN gene up to bp -170. Studies of the 5'-flanking region beyond bp -183 in transgenic mice suggested that other regulatory elements may be present upstream of bp -183, but the positions of these elements were uncertain. In the present study, the existence of regulatory regions of the GENENOTIN gene responding to stimulation by feeding was examined using in vivo hydrodynamics-based gene transfection (HT) in mouse liver. The firefly-luciferase (FL) gene, fused with various lengths of the 5'-flanking region of the GENENOTIN gene, was introduced into mouse liver by HT. The mice had free access to a high-CHEMICALNOTIN diet. In liver homogenate, luciferase activity of pGENENOTIN(-1467)-FL (which included the 5'-flanking region from bp -1467 to +17), was markedly stimulated by feeding. 5'-Deletion up to bp -1065 caused only minor changes in luciferase activity, but further deletion up to bp -690 and bp -203 caused significant, gradual decreases in activity. Further analyses utilizing 5'-deletion mutants indicated the existence of positive regulatory regions that respond to stimulation by feeding between bp -1065 and -945, and between -300 and -203 on the GENENOTIN gene. These results suggest that unidentified GENENOTIN exist in the upstream region of the GENENOTIN gene, and that HT is a useful approach for detecting regulatory regions of genes expressed in the liver.
23571107	The Ras-GTPase activity of neurofibromin restrains ERK-dependent FGFR signaling during endochondral bone formation. The severe defects in growth plate development caused by chondrocyte extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) gain or loss-of-function suggest that tight spatial and temporal regulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling is necessary to achieve harmonious growth plate elongation and structure. We provide here evidence that neurofibromin, via its Ras guanosine triphosphatase -activating activity, controls ERK1/2-dependent fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling in chondrocytes. We show first that neurofibromin is expressed in FGFR-positive prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes during growth plate endochondral ossification. Using mice lacking neurofibromin 1 (Nf1) in type II collagen-expressing cells, (Nf1col2(-/-) mutant mice), we then show that lack of neurofibromin in post-mitotic chondrocytes triggers a number of phenotypes reminiscent of the ones observed in mice characterized by FGFR gain-of-function mutations. Those include dwarfism, constitutive ERK1/2 activation, strongly reduced Ihh expression and decreased chondrocyte proliferation and maturation, increased chondrocytic expression of Rankl, matrix metalloproteinase 9 (Mmp9) and Mmp13 and enhanced growth plate osteoclastogenesis, as well as increased sensitivity to caspase-9 mediated apoptosis. Using wildtype (WT) and Nf1(-/-) chondrocyte cultures in vitro, we show that FGF2 pulse-stimulation triggers rapid ERK1/2 phosphorylation in both genotypes, but that return to the basal level is delayed in Nf1(-/-) chondrocytes. Importantly, in vivo ERK1/2 inhibition by daily injection of a recombinant form of C-type natriuretic peptide to post-natal pups for 18 days was able to correct the short stature of Nf1col2(-/-) mice. Together, these results underscore the requirement of neurofibromin and ERK1/2 for normal endochondral bone formation and support the notion that neurofibromin, by restraining RAS-ERK1/2 signaling, is a negative regulator of FGFR signaling in differentiating chondrocytes.
10690753	CHEMICALIN block of recombinant GENEIN: selectivity for the GENEIN subunit. The anticonvulsant CHEMICALIN blocks GENEIN but fails to exhibit the neurobehavioral toxicity characteristic of other GENEIN antagonists. To investigate the possibility that felbamate's favorable toxicity profile could be related to GENENOTIN subtype selectivity, we examined the specificity of CHEMICALIN block of recombinant GENEIN composed of the GENEIN subunit and various GENEIN subunits. CHEMICALIN produced a rapid, concentration-dependent block of currents evoked by 50 microM CHEMICALNOTIN and 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the GENEIN subunit, and either the GENEIN, GENEIN or GENEIN subunits; the IC50 values for block were 2.6, 0.52 and 2.4 mM, respectively (holding potential, - 60 mV). The Hill coefficient values were < 1 and, in kinetic analyses, onset and recovery from block were well fit by double exponential functions, indicating binding to more than one blocking site on the GENENOTIN channel complex. The higher affinity of CHEMICALIN block of GENEIN containing the GENEIN subunit could be accounted for by more rapid association and slower dissociation from these sites. We conclude that CHEMICALIN exhibits modest selectivity for GENEIN composed of GENEIN/GENEIN subunits. This selectivity could, in part, account for the more favorable clinical profile of CHEMICALIN in comparison with GENEIN antagonists that do not show subunit selectivity.
23532634	Adrenocortical reserves in hyperthyroidism. Explicit data regarding the changes in adrenocortical reserves during hyperthyroidism do not exist. We aimed to document the capability (response) of adrenal gland to secrete CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-S during hyperthyroidism compared to euthyroidism, and to describe factors associated with these responses. A standard-dose (0.25Â mg/i.v.) GENENOTIN stimulation test was performed to the same patients before hyperthyroidism treatment, and after attainment of euthyroidism. Baseline CHEMICALNOTIN (Cor0), CHEMICALNOTIN-S (CHEMICALNOTIN-S0), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, calculated free CHEMICALNOTIN (by Coolen's equationÂ =Â CFC), free CHEMICALNOTIN index (FCI), 60-min CHEMICALNOTIN (Cor60), and CHEMICALNOTIN-S (CHEMICALNOTIN-S60), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN-S (CHEMICALNOTIN-S) responses were evaluated. Forty-one patients [22 females, 49.5Â Â±Â 15.2Â years old, 32 Graves disease, nine toxic nodular goiter] had similar Cor0, CHEMICALNOTIN-S0, CFC, FCI, and CHEMICALNOTIN-S60 in hyperthyroid and euthyroid states. Cor60, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN-S were lower in hyperthyroidism. In four (10Â %) patients the peak GENEIN-stimulated CHEMICALIN values were lower than 18Â Î¼g/dL. When the test repeated after attainment of euthyroidism, all of the patients had normal CHEMICALNOTIN response. Regression analysis demonstrated an independent association of Cor60 with free T3 in hyperthyroidism. However, the predictors of CFC, FCI, and CHEMICALNOTIN-S levels were serum CHEMICALNOTIN levels in hyperthyroidism, and both CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN levels in euthyroidism. GENEIN-stimulated peak CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN-S levels are decreased during hyperthyroidism, probably due to increased turnover. Since about 10Â % of the subjects with hyperthyroidism are at risk for adrenal insufficiency, clinicians dealing with Graves' disease should be alert to the possibility of adrenal insufficiency during hyperthyroid stage.
10999950	Mechanisms of agonist-induced down-regulation of the GENENOTIN: internalization is required for down-regulation. Previously, we showed that the GENEIN (GENEIN) stably expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells underwent down-regulation after prolonged CHEMICALIN treatment. In the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying this process. CHEMICALIN caused a significant down-regulation of the GENEIN, although CHEMICALIN did not. Neither CHEMICALIN nor CHEMICALIN caused down-regulation of the GENEIN. Thus, similar to internalization, there are agonist and species differences in down-regulation of GENENOTIN. Expression of the dominant negative mutants GENENOTIN(319-418) or GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN significantly reduced CHEMICALIN-induced down-regulation of the GENEIN. Coexpression of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN permitted CHEMICALIN to induce down-regulation of the GENEIN, although expression of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN alone did not. Expression of the dominant negative mutants GENEIN-GENEIN or GENEIN-GENEIN blunted CHEMICALIN-induced down-regulation. Pretreatment with lysosomal enzyme inhibitors CHEMICALNOTIN or GENENOTIN inhibitors (GENEIN inhibitor I, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN) decreased the extent of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced down-regulation. A combination of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitor I abolished CHEMICALNOTIN-induced down-regulation. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN-induced down-regulation of the GENEIN involves GENENOTIN-, GENENOTIN-, GENENOTIN-, GENENOTIN-, and GENENOTIN-dependent mechanisms and receptors seem to be trafficked to lysosomes and GENENOTIN for degradation. Thus, CHEMICALIN-induced internalization and down-regulation of the GENEIN share initial common mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, these results represent the first report on the involvement of both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in agonist-induced down-regulation of a GENENOTIN. In addition, this study is among the first to show the involvement of GENENOTIN in agonist-induced down-regulation of a GENENOTIN.
10847421	Dose-dependent release of endogenous tissue factor pathway inhibitor by different low molecular weight heparins. Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) is released to circulating blood after intravenous and subcutaneous injections of heparins, and may thus contribute to the antithrombotic effect of heparins. A previous study suggested different abilities of various low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) to release endogenous TFPI, but the dose-response relationship was not determined. In the present study, the dose-response relationship for escalating doses of two LMWHs, dalteparin and enoxaparin, on the release of endogenous TFPI was investigated. Six healthy male participants were given 50, 100 and 200 U/kg dalteparin and 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg enoxaparin as a single subcutaneous injection. The study was a randomized, cross-over design with a 1-week wash-out period between each injection. Peak free TFPI antigen and TFPI activity were detected after only 1 h, whereas anti-activated factor X (anti-FXa) and anti-activated factor II (anti-FIIa) activities were detected after 2-6 h. Putative therapeutic equivalent doses of dalteparin and enoxaparin gave similar release of endogenous TFPI, but dissimilar effects on anti-FXa and anti-FIIa activities.
23456735	Life-threatening hypoglycemia associated with intentional insulin ingestion. There are reports of insulin overdose by injection, yet little is known regarding the potential harms of intentional oral ingestion of insulin. In this report, we describe a case of massive insulin ingestion and ensuing hypoglycemia. To our knowledge, there are no previously published cases of hypoglycemia caused by intentional insulin ingestion. A 51-year-old man intentionally ingested three 10-ml vials (total of 3000 units) of various insulins: one vial each of insulin aspart, lispro, and glargine. Four symptomatic hypoglycemic episodes, with blood glucose levels of 48, 25, 34, and 40Â mg/dl, occurred approximately 1, 3, 4, and 5Â hours, respectively, after ingestion. The hypoglycemia could not be explained other than the ingestion of the insulins. The patient was admitted for observation, and euglycemia occurred within 24Â hours without any additional hypoglycemic episodes. Hypoglycemia treatment is reviewed in this case report, and factors that may affect systemic response of orally ingested insulin, including gastrointestinal absorption and insulin sensitivity, are discussed. In addition, the findings of our case report may provide useful insight into the development of novel oral insulin products that are currently in research. Despite poor bioavailability (1%) when taken orally, insulin may produce symptomatic hypoglycemia with a massive ingestion. Vigilant blood glucose monitoring, supportive care with glucose replacement therapy, and admission to the hospital for observation may be required.
22532499	Effect of water extracts from edible myrtaceae plants on uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN in GENENOTIN-treated FL83B mouse hepatocytes. This study investigated the CHEMICALNOTIN uptake activity of the water extracts from the leaves and fruit of edible Myrtaceae plants, including guava (Psidium guajava Linn.), wax apples [Syzygium samarangense (Blume) Merr. and L.M. Perry], Pu-Tau [Syzygium jambo (L.) Alston], and Kan-Shi Pu-Tau (Syzygium cumini Linn.) in FL83B mouse hepatocytes. The fluorescent dye CHEMICALNOTIN was used to estimate the uptake ability of the cells. CHEMICALNOTIN uptake test showed that pink wax apple fruit extract (PWFE) exhibits the highest CHEMICALNOTIN uptake activity, at an increment of 21% in the GENENOTIN-resistant FL83B mouse hepatocytes as compared with the GENENOTIN-treated control group. CHEMICALNOTIN was isolated using column chromatography of PWFE. This compound, at the concentration of 6.25âÂµg/mL, exhibits the same CHEMICALNOTIN uptake improvement in GENENOTIN-resistant cells as PWFE at a 100-Âµg/mL dose. We postulate that CHEMICALIN is an active component in PWFE that may alleviate the GENEIN resistance in mouse hepatocytes.
23313557	GENENOTIN-dependent and -independent interaction of glucocorticoids with the regulatory pathways involved in the control of CHEMICALNOTIN handling by the liver. Treatment with glucocorticoids (GCs) may cause adverse effects, including cholestasis. The ability of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN to affect the liver handling of CHEMICALNOTIN (BAs) has been investigated. In rats treated with GCs for 4 days, altered serum and bile BA levels, changed conjugation pattern, and delayed and decreased ability to conjugate/secrete exogenously administered CHEMICALNOTIN, were found using HPLC-MS/MS. RT-QPCR analyses revealed that GC treatment also induced a down-regulation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), transporters (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) and enzymes (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), whereas GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were up-regulated. Human HepG2 and Alexander cell lines were used as in vitro models of liver cells with and without constitutive GENENOTIN expression, respectively. In HepG2 cells, GCs induced a decreased expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and inhibited the regulatory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN-target genes. In Alexander cells, only when they were transfected with GENENOTIN+GENENOTIN, CHEMICALIN caused up-regulation of GENEIN and GENEIN, and a down-regulation of GENEIN. GCs had the opposite effect on these genes, both in the absence and in the presence of GENENOTIN expression. Co-transfection of Alexander cells with IR-1-Luc and GENENOTIN+GENENOTIN revealed that GCs did not inhibit but moderately enhanced GENENOTIN activity. Moreover, GCs have a synergistic effect on CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN activation, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN have an additive effect. In conclusion, GCs are able to directly or indirectly activate GENENOTIN but they also antagonize, through GENENOTIN-independent mechanisms, the expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN target genes involved in the hepatic handling of BAs.
23542147	CHEMICALNOTIN extract of Adiantum capillus-veneris L. suppresses the production of inflammatory mediators by inhibiting GENENOTIN activation. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Adiantum capillus-veneris L. is a wildly distributed plant species and has been extensively used in south of China as traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammatory diseases. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of ethanolic extracts of Adiantum capillus-veneris L. and the involvement of GENENOTIN signaling in the regulation of inflammation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The plant ethanolic extracts were initially tested against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) production in RAW264.7 mouse macrophages, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) production in human U937 monocytes. The effect of the plant extracts on the transcription factor GENENOTIN GENENOTIN) pathway was evaluated in GENENOTIN stimulated HepG2 cells by luciferase gene reporter assay and Western blotting at the transcriptional and translational levels. Subsequently, the inhibition of GENENOTIN downstream gene expression (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) by the plant extracts was assessed via quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Lastly, the anti-inflammatory activities of the plant extracts in vivo were evaluated by testing spleen index and GENENOTIN related protein expression in LPS-stimulated CD1 mice. RESULTS: The plant ethanolic extracts effectively suppressed CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN release with an IC50 less than 50Î¼g/ml. Moreover, luciferase expression could be specifically blocked in HepG2 cells, not in HEK293 cells, showing that the plant extracts displayed a cell-specific pattern on GENENOTIN gene transcription. The assayed biological activity also depended on the order of adding GENENOTIN and the plant extracts because the plant extracts could only block the GENENOTIN activation if added earlier but were unable to stop the signal when added after GENENOTIN. However, the plant extracts did not exert any effect on ubiquitination which regulates several steps in the GENENOTIN pathway. Additionally, the plant extracts down-regulated phosphorylation of GENENOTIN at S176/180, GENENOTIN at T180/Y182 and GENENOTIN at S536, but not GENENOTIN at S276. This was confirmed by their ability to selectively abrogate the induction of GENENOTIN transcription, whereas the GENENOTIN gene, which is not transcribed selectively by an GENENOTIN complex containing a form of GENEIN phosphorylated on CHEMICALIN536, did not change. Finally, the plant extracts at 200Î¼g/mg could normalize the LPS-induced elevation of spleen index as well as GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activations in CD1 mice. CONCLUSION: The present studies presents the potential utilization of this plant extracts, as a natural resources for the development of an anti-inflammatory medicine.
23601753	Robust autoactivation, GENENOTIN independence and diminished secretion define a subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated GENENOTIN mutants. Mutations in GENENOTIN cause hereditary pancreatitis by altering its proteolytic regulation of activation and degradation by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). GENENOTIN stimulates trypsinogen autoactivation by processing the activation peptide to a shorter form but also promotes degradation by cleaving the GENENOTIN in trypsinogen. Mutations render trypsinogen resistant to GENENOTIN-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by GENENOTIN. Here we demonstrate that activation peptide mutations GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of GENENOTIN. Degradation of the mutants by GENENOTIN was unchanged and processing of the activation peptide was increased only in the GENENOTIN mutant by 4-fold. Surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. The GENEIN in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds CHEMICALIN (KD ~1.6 mM), which stimulates autoactivation. Unexpectedly, CHEMICALNOTIN binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. Despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants GENEIN and GENEIN was not stimulated by CHEMICALIN. Finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. We conclude that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis associated mutations, which exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of GENENOTIN. The potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis.

23621521	Small molecule mediated proliferation of primary retinal pigment epithelial cells. Retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells form a monolayer adjacent to the retina and play a critical role in the visual light cycle. Degeneration of this layer results in vision loss, causing retinal disorders such as age-related macular degeneration. Cell transplant therapies exist to restore vision loss; however, risks associated with and an inadequate supply of donor cells have limited their therapeutic success. The identification of factors that proliferate RPE cells ex vivo could provide a renewable source of cells for the treatment of such disorders. We show that a small molecule (WS3) can reversibly proliferate primary RPE cells isolated from fetal and adult human donors. Following withdrawal of WS3, RPE cells differentiate into a functional monolayer, as exhibited by their expression of mature RPE genes and phagocytosis of photoreceptor outer segments. Furthermore, chemically expanded RPE cells preserve vision when transplanted into dystrophic Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) rats, a well-established model of retinal degeneration.
7959748	Murine chromosomal location of the GENENOTIN genes. GENEIN are the membrane proteins that mediate the pain-relieving effect of opioid drugs, such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN as well as GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN. Using cDNAs for the GENENOTIN, we mapped the chromosomal locations of their genes in mouse. Multilocus cross analysis located the GENENOTIN gene GENENOTIN on Chr 10 and the GENENOTIN gene GENENOTIN on Chr 1. Both genes are near centromere, with no markers more centromeric. These data indicate that the two GENENOTIN are different gene products, ruling out the possibility that they may be differential splicing products from the same gene.
23085095	The exposure of highly toxic CHEMICALIN does not significantly impact the activity and expression of GENEIN in rats determined by a novel ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric method of a specific probe CHEMICALNOTIN. Aconitum species are widely used to treat rheumatism, cardiovascular diseases, and tumors in China and other Asian countries. The herbs are always used with drugs such as CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (AC) is one of the main bioactive/high-toxic alkaloids of Aconitum roots. AC is metabolized by GENENOTIN. However, whether AC inhibits/induces GENENOTIN, which causes drug-drug interaction (DDI) is unclear. Our study aims to explore the potent effects of AC, as a marker component of Aconitum, on GENEIN using the probe CHEMICALIN in rats. The effects of oral AC on pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN were evaluated. GENEIN activity and protein levels in rat liver microsomes pretreated with oral AC were also measured using in vitro CHEMICALIN metabolism and Western blot. CHEMICALNOTIN and its major metabolites CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were determined using a newly validated UPLC-MS/MS method. Single dose and 7-day AC administration at 0.125mg/kg had no effect on GENENOTIN activity since no change in the formation of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. GENENOTIN activity and protein levels in liver microsomes were also not affected by 7-day AC pretreatment at 0.125mg/kg. Therefore, AC neither inhibits nor induces GENENOTIN in rats, indicating AC does not cause GENENOTIN-related DDI in the liver.
23230273	The GENENOTIN modulates transcription factor recruitment and establishes proper GENENOTINK36 trimethylation during active transcription. Recent studies have revealed a close relationship between transcription, GENENOTIN modification, and RNA processing. In fact, genome-wide analyses that correlate histone marks with RNA processing signals raise the possibility that specific RNA processing factors may modulate transcription and help to "write" chromatin marks. Here we show that the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) directs recruitment of transcription elongation factors and establishes proper GENENOTIN marks during active transcription. A directed genetic screen revealed that deletion of either subunit of the GENENOTIN confers a synthetic growth defect when combined with deletion of genes encoding either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN physically associates with these complexes to recruit them during transcription and mediates phosphorylation at CHEMICALIN-2 of the CHEMICALIN-terminal domain (CTD) of GENEIN. To understand how these interactions influence downstream events, GENENOTINK36me3 was examined, and we demonstrate that GENENOTINÎ affects proper GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTINK36me3. Consistent with this, the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN have similar effects on the ability to rapidly induce and sustain activated gene expression, and these effects are distinct from other GENENOTIN methyltransferases. This work provides evidence for an emerging model that RNA processing factors can modulate the recruitment of transcription factors and influence GENENOTIN modification during elongation.
10947967	Kinetic and stereochemical studies on novel inactivators of CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal amidation. CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal amidation, a required post-translational modification for the bioactivation of many neuropeptides, entails sequential enzymic action by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN). Here we introduce novel compounds in which an olefinic functionality is incorporated into peptide analogues as the most potent turnover-dependent inactivators of GENENOTIN. Kinetic parameters for GENEIN inactivation by CHEMICALIN were obtained by using both the conventional dilution assay method and the more complex progress curve method. The results obtained from the progress curve method establish that these compounds exhibit the kinetic characteristics of pure competitive inactivators (i.e. no ESI complex forms during inactivation). On the basis of k(inact)/K(i) values, CHEMICALNOTIN is almost two orders of magnitude more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN, a chemically analogous olefinic inactivator that lacks the peptide moiety. Stereochemical studies established that GENEIN inactivation by CHEMICALIN is stereospecific with respect to the moiety at the P(2) position, which is consistent with previous results with substrates and reversible inhibitors. In contrast, CHEMICALIN, which is a competitive inhibitor with respect to CHEMICALNOTIN, exhibits a low degree of stereospecificity in binding to the CHEMICALNOTIN sites of both GENEIN and GENEIN.
23530018	CHEMICALIN Dyes as Differential Modulators of Organic Anion Transport by GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mediate the CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent efflux of structurally diverse compounds, including anticancer drugs and physiological organic anions. Five classes of CHEMICALIN dyes (CHEMICALIN) were examined for their ability to modulate transport of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) (a prototypical GENEIN substrate) into GENENOTIN-enriched inside-out membrane vesicles. Additionally, some CHEMICALNOTIN were tested in intact transfected cells using a CHEMICALNOTIN efflux assay. Sixteen of 34 CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake by >50% (IC50's 0.7-7.6 Î¼M). Of 9 CHEMICALNOTIN with IC50's â¤2 Î¼M, two belonged to Class I, two to Class III and five to Class V. When tested in the intact cells, only 4 of 16 CHEMICALIN (at 10 Î¼M) inhibited GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN efflux by >50% (III-1, V-3, -4, -6) while a fifth (I-5) inhibited efflux by just 23%. These five CHEMICALIN also inhibited CHEMICALIN uptake by GENEIN. In contrast, their effects on GENEIN varied with two (V-4, V-6) inhibiting CHEMICALNOTIN transport (IC50's 2.0, 9.2 Î¼M), two (V-3, III-1) stimulating transport (>2-fold), while CHEMICALIN I-5 had no effect. Strikingly, although V-3 and V-4 had opposite effects on GENENOTIN activity, they are structurally identical except for their CHEMICALNOTIN atom (CHEMICALNOTIN versus CHEMICALNOTIN). This study is the first to identify Class V CGPs with their distinctive CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN linkage between two disubstituted CHEMICALIN moieties as a particularly potent class of GENEIN modulators and also show that within this core structure, differences in the electronegativity associated with a CHEMICALNOTIN atom can be the sole determinant of whether a compound will stimulate or inhibit GENENOTIN.
23290724	CHEMICALIN drives a tertiary fold in the GENEIN with familial disease mutation sites at the interface. The cellular GENEIN consists of two domains--a flexible CHEMICALIN-terminal domain, which participates in CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN regulation, and a largely helical CHEMICALIN-terminal domain that converts to Î² sheet in the course of prion disease. These two domains are thought to be fully independent and noninteracting. Compelling cellular and biophysical studies, however, suggest a higher order structure that is relevant to both GENENOTIN function and misfolding in disease. Here, we identify a CHEMICALIN-driven CHEMICALIN-terminal to CHEMICALIN-terminal tertiary interaction in GENEIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal surface participating in this interaction carries the majority of the point mutations that confer familial prion disease. Investigation of mutant GENENOTIN finds a systematic relationship between the type of mutation and the apparent strength of this domain structure. The structural features identified here suggest mechanisms by which physiologic metal ions trigger GENENOTIN trafficking and control prion disease.
23153456	GENENOTIN converts GENENOTIN into a GENENOTIN efficiently activating GENENOTIN and its downstream targets. Besides their antiviral activity, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) display context-specific immunomodulation. In contrast to long-known GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN is an anti-bacterial, largely tissue protective GENENOTIN that recently gained attention. Herein, cellular GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interactions are investigated. We report that pre-conditioning of epithelial cells with GENENOTIN initiated dramatic changes in GENENOTIN signaling normally dominated by GENENOTIN. Specifically, by using human DLD1 colon epithelial/carcinoma cells we demonstrate that, upon GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN converts into a GENENOTIN robustly activating GENENOTIN and its downstream pro-inflammatory targets GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Accordingly, only after GENENOTIN pre-incubation was GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN binding to the GENENOTIN detectable. Using the viral mimic CHEMICALIN and the GENEIN antagonist B18R we furthermore demonstrate the capability of endogenous GENEIN to promote GENEIN-induced GENEIN activation and expression of GENEIN. GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN activation subsequent to GENENOTIN priming became likewise apparent in human Caco2 colon epithelial/carcinoma cells, HepG2 hepatoma cells, and primary keratinocytes. Current observations may relate to characteristics of GENENOTIN in clinical therapy and expose margins of tissue protection by GENENOTIN application.
12244038	CHEMICALIN, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibits the induction of GENEIN in human astrocytes. CHEMICALIN, a lipid-lowering drug, inhibited GENEIN-induced production of CHEMICALIN and the expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) in human U373MG astroglial cells and primary astrocytes. Similar to CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, another CHEMICALIN drug, also inhibited the expression of GENEIN. Inhibition of GENEIN-driven luciferase activity by CHEMICALIN in GENENOTIN-stimulated U373MG astroglial cells suggests that this compound inhibits the transcription of GENEIN. Since CHEMICALIN is known to activate GENEIN (GENEIN), we investigated the role of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN. CHEMICALIN induced GENEIN (GENEIN)-dependent luciferase activity, which was inhibited by the expression of GENENOTIN, the dominant-negative mutant of GENENOTIN. However, GENENOTIN was unable to abrogate CHEMICALIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN suggesting that CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN independent of GENEIN. The GENENOTIN contains consensus sequences for the binding of transcription factors, including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) binding to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) binding to gamma-activation site (GAS), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN); therefore, we investigated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on the activation of these transcription factors. The combination of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN induced the activation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GAS but not that of GENENOTIN, suggesting that GENENOTIN may not be involved in GENENOTIN-induced expression of GENENOTIN in human astrocytes. Interestingly, CHEMICALIN strongly inhibited the activation of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN but not that of GAS in GENEIN-stimulated astroglial cells. These results suggest that CHEMICALIN inhibits the induction of GENEIN probably by inhibiting the activation of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN and that CHEMICALNOTIN, a prescribed drug for humans, may further find its therapeutic use in neuroinflammatory diseases.
17692748	Central sympatholysis as a novel countermeasure for CHEMICALNOTIN-induced sympathetic activation and vasoconstriction in humans. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine whether cocaine's sympathomimetic actions can be reversed by a potent centrally acting GENEIN (GENEIN) agonist (CHEMICALIN). BACKGROUND: We recently showed that CHEMICALNOTIN stimulates the human cardiovascular system primarily by acting in the brain to increase sympathetic nerve activity (SNA), the neural stimulus to CHEMICALNOTIN release. Thus, SNA constitutes a putative new drug target to block cocaine's adverse cardiovascular effects at their origin. METHODS: In 22 healthy CHEMICALNOTIN-naive humans, we measured skin SNA (microneurography) and skin blood flow (laser Doppler velocimetry) as well as heart rate and blood pressure before and after intranasal CHEMICALNOTIN (2 mg/kg) alone and in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN or saline. RESULTS: During intranasal CHEMICALNOTIN alone, SNA increased by 2-fold and skin vascular resistance increased from 13.2 +/- 2.3 to 20.1 +/- 2.2 resistance units while mean arterial pressure increased by 14 +/- 3 mm Hg and heart rate by 18 +/- 3 beats/min (p < 0.01). CHEMICALNOTIN abolished these increases, whereas intravenous saline was without effect. CHEMICALIN was effective in blocking these sympathomimetic actions of CHEMICALNOTIN even in all 7 subjects who were homozygous for the Del322-325 polymorphism in the GENEIN, a loss-of-function mutation that is highly enriched in blacks. CONCLUSIONS: The data advance the novel hypothesis that central sympatholysis with CHEMICALIN constitutes a highly effective countermeasure for cocaine's sympathomimetic actions on the human cardiovascular system, even in individuals carrying the GENEINDel322-325 polymorphism.

15465035	The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activation is not dependent on CHEMICALNOTIN-GENEIN pathway. Adaptation to hypoxia and maintenance of CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis involve a wide range of responses that occur at different organizational levels in the body. One of the most important transcription factors that activate the expression of CHEMICALNOTIN-regulated genes is GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) mediates a variety of biological effects including relaxation of blood vessels and cytotoxicity of activated macrophages. We investigated the effect of the clinically used nitrates CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on GENEIN-mediated transcriptional responses to hypoxia. We demonstrate that among the three nitrates, only CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN activation in response to hypoxia. In contrast, CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN does not affect GENEIN activity. CHEMICALIN inhibits the accumulation of GENEIN, the regulatory subunit of GENEIN, and the transcriptional activation of GENEIN via a mechanism that is not dependent on either CHEMICALNOTIN or GENEIN.
11430635	CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN and antagonizes the effect of the specific GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN, by a direct mechanism of action. OBJECTIVES: In this paper we investigated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and their combination in vitro and in vivo on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) isozymes. METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified GENENOTIN as well as on GENENOTIN using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on red cell GENENOTIN and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte GENEIN and GENEIN activity. CHEMICALIN, a specific inhibitor of GENEIN, reduces the activity of GENEIN and GENEIN from red cells. CHEMICALIN completely antagonizes GENEIN activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte GENENOTIN activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that CHEMICALIN, a known GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, is also an activator of GENEIN. Our data also prove that CHEMICALIN is not only an activator of GENEIN but also antagonizes the effect of CHEMICALIN, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of GENENOTIN in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, GENEIN activation induced by CHEMICALIN might cause changes in GENEIN activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in GENEIN activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.
12871155	Recent developments in the synthesis of GENENOTIN inhibitors. The GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitory activities of a series of CHEMICALIN (2, 3), CHEMICALIN (5, 6), CHEMICALIN (11-13)/ CHEMICALIN (14), CHEMICALIN (15)/ CHEMICALIN (16) are described. These compounds are CHEMICALNOTIN analogues that have been prepared from readily available polyfunctionalized CHEMICALNOTIN (9, 10), CHEMICALNOTIN (7, 8), CHEMICALNOTIN (17-19) and CHEMICALNOTIN (20) via Friedlander condensation with selected CHEMICALNOTIN. These compounds are competitive and, in a few cases, non-competitive inhibitors for GENEIN, the most potent being compound (14), though three-fold less active than CHEMICALIN. The GENEIN inhibitory activity is only significant in compounds 11 and 14, ten-fold less active than CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, the products 12 and 13 are selective and moderate GENENOTIN inhibitors.
23594301	Development and validation of NIR-chemometric methods for chemical and pharmaceutical characterization of meloxicam tablets. Abstract Context: Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is an important component of a Process Analytical Technology (PAT) toolbox and is a key technology for enabling the rapid analysis of pharmaceutical tablets. Objective: The aim of this research work was to develop and validate NIR-chemometric methods not only for the determination of active pharmaceutical ingredients content but also pharmaceutical properties (crushing strength, disintegration time) of meloxicam tablets. Materials and methods: The development of the method for active content assay was performed on samples corresponding to 80%, 90%, 100%, 110% and 120% of meloxicam content and the development of the methods for pharmaceutical characterization was performed on samples prepared at seven different compression forces (ranging from 7 to 45âkN) using NIR transmission spectra of intact tablets and PLS as a regression method. Results: The results show that the developed methods have good trueness, precision and accuracy and are appropriate for direct active content assay in tablets (ranging from 12 to 18 mg/tablet) and also for predicting crushing strength and disintegration time of intact meloxicam tablets. Discussion: The comparative data show that the proposed methods are in good agreement with the reference methods currently used for the characterization of meloxicam tablets (HPLC-UV methods for the assay and European Pharmacopeia methods for determining the crushing strength and disintegration time). Conclusion: The results show the possibility to predict both chemical properties (active content) and physical/pharmaceutical properties (crushing strength and disintegration time) directly, without any sample preparation, from the same NIR transmission spectrum of meloxicam tablets.
23643730	CHEMICALIN, isolated from Juglans mandshurica Maxim, induces apoptosis via down-regulation of GENEIN expression in human prostate cancer LNCaP cells. CHEMICALNOTIN is a natural compound which has been isolated from Juglans mandshurica Maxim. Recent studies have shown that CHEMICALNOTIN had various pharmacological effects such as anti-viral, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer. However, its anti-cancer activity on human prostate cancer LNCaP cell has not been examined. Thus, the current study was designed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of apoptosis induced by CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive prostate cancer LNCaP cells. CHEMICALNOTIN assay was performed to examine the anti-proliferative effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. Occurrence of apoptosis was detected by CHEMICALNOTIN staining and flow cytometry in LNCaP cells treated with CHEMICALNOTIN for 24h. The result shown that CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the growth of LNCaP cells in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological changes of apoptotic body formation after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment were observed by CHEMICALNOTIN staining. This apoptotic induction was associated with loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, and GENENOTIN activation. Moreover, we found that CHEMICALIN significantly inhibited the expression levels of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) in a dose-dependent manner, as well as abrogated up-regulation of GENEIN and GENEIN genes with and/or without CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Take together, our results demonstrated that CHEMICALIN might induce the apoptosis in LNCaP cell via down-regulation of GENEIN expression. Therefore, our results indicated that CHEMICALNOTIN may be a potential candidate of drug for CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive prostate cancer.
23537942	Anticancer activity of novel hybrid molecules containing 5-benzylidene thiazolidine-2,4-dione. Hybridization of two different bioactive molecules with different mechanism of action is one of the methods that are being adopted to treat cancer. Molecules bearing a thiazolidine-2,4-dione scaffold have been recognized as antineoplastic agents with a broad spectrum of activity against many cancer cell lines. In this manuscript we have described the synthesis and biological evaluation of two series of N-3-substituted-5-arylidene thiazolidine-2,4-diones, bearing the Î±-bromoacryloylamido moiety at the para- or meta-position on the phenyl of the arylidene portion. We have observed that selected compounds 5a, 5c and 5g suppress proliferation of human myeloid leukaemia HL-60 and U937 cells by triggering morphological changes and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation, which are well-known features of apoptosis. Finally, our results indicated that the investigated compounds induced apoptotic cell death through a mechanism that involved activation of multiple caspases and was also associated with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria.
23276627	Methylation damage to RNA induced in vivo in Escherichia coli is repaired by endogenous AlkB as part of the adaptive response. Cytotoxic 1-methyladenine (1-meA) and 3-methylcytosine (3-meC) lesions induced in DNA and RNA in vitro and in pre-damaged DNA and RNA bacteriophages in vivo are repaired by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) protein AlkB and a human homolog, ALKBH3. However, it is not known whether endogenous RNA is repaired in vivo by repair proteins present at physiological concentrations. The concept of RNA repair as a biologically relevant process has therefore remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate AlkB-mediated repair of endogenous RNA in vivo by measuring differences in lesion-accumulation in two independent AlkB-proficient and deficient E. coli strains during exposure to methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). Repair was observed both in AlkB-overproducing strains and in the wild-type strains after AlkB induction. RNA repair appeared to be highest in RNA species below 200 nucleotides in size, mainly comprising tRNAs. Strikingly, at least 10-fold more lesions were repaired in RNA than in DNA. This may be a consequence of some 30-fold higher levels of aberrant methylation in RNA than in DNA after exposure to MMS. A high primary kinetic isotope effect (>10) was measured using a deuterated methylated RNA substrate, D3-1me(rA), demonstrating that it is the catalytic step, and not the search step that is rate-limiting. Our results demonstrate that RNA repair by AlkB takes place in endogenous RNA as part of an adaptive response in wild-type E. coli cells.
23380568	Association of serum proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 with carotid intima media thickness in hypertensive subjects. OBJECTIVE: The clinical significance of the measurement of serum PCSK9 (proprotein subtilisin kexin type 9) is not well defined. This study investigated the association between serum PCSK9 levels and atherosclerosis assessed by carotid intima media thickness (IMT) in hypertensive patients. METHODS: A total of 126 hypertensive patients over the age of 45 were enrolled. The maximum carotid IMT (max-IMT) and the mean carotid IMT (mean-IMT) were measured at the time of enrollment. Clinical and laboratory parameters including serum PCSK9 were analyzed. RESULTS: Patients were divided into tertiles based on serum PCSK9 levels. After adjusting for age, sex, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride, max-IMT was significantly increased in the highest tertile of serum PCSK9 (0.969Â±0.033 vs 0.959Â±0.033 vs 1.077Â±0.033mm, respectively; P=0.026). Mean-IMT showed a tendency to increase across the tertile groups (0.773Â±0.025 vs 0.790Â±0.026 vs 0.856Â±0.025mm, respectively; P=0.059). Multivariate regression analysis revealed that serum PCSK9 was independently associated with carotid IMT (max-IMT: Î²=0.212, P=0.016; mean-IMT: Î²=0.184, P=0.04). CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to report the association between serum PCSK9 levels and carotid IMT in hypertensive patients. These results suggest that serum PCSK9 may have a certain role in early pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.
6146346	CHEMICALIN, a potent GENEIN antagonist: effect in allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, on antigen and CHEMICALNOTIN induced skin weal responses and relationship to serum levels. The efficacy of CHEMICALIN, a new, long acting, oral GENEIN antagonist was compared to placebo for the treatment of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis during the grass pollen season of 1982. Sixty-three patients with a positive skin prick test to grass pollen and current symptoms participated in an 8 week, double-blind, randomized study. CHEMICALNOTIN, 10 mg, was significantly better than placebo in alleviating both nose (P less than 0.05) and eye (P less than 0.01) symptoms despite significantly greater use of the reserve medication, CHEMICALNOTIN, by the placebo group (P less than 0.003). There was a lag period of 5 days after initiation of therapy before treatment benefit became manifest. Subdivision of nasal symptoms indicated significant improvement compared to placebo over the 8 weeks for sneezing (P less than 0.05) and runny nose (P less than 0.05) but not blocked nose. The absence of effect on nasal blockage was confirmed by parallel measurement of nasal calibre by body plethysmography. The antihistaminic potency of CHEMICALNOTIN was indicated by an 80% inhibition of the CHEMICALNOTIN induced skin weal response after 8 weeks therapy. A positive correlation was found between serum drug levels and % inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN skin weal (r = 0.64, P less than 0.001). CHEMICALNOTIN was free from adverse sedative or anticholinergic effects but did cause a mean increase in weight of 1.3 kg (P less than 0.01) after 8 weeks therapy, not found with placebo.
19370562	CHEMICALNOTIN for Alzheimer's disease. BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of GENENOTIN inhibitors to delay the breakdown of CHEMICALNOTIN released into synaptic clefts. CHEMICALIN, the first of the GENEIN inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other GENEIN inhibitors, including CHEMICALIN, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low risk of adverse effects, have now been introduced. CHEMICALNOTIN has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of CHEMICALNOTIN for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 27 March 2008 using the terms: CHEMICALNOTIN OR CHEMICALNOTIN OR CHEMICALNOTIN OR "CHEMICALNOTIN" . The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials, involving 4775 participants, were included in the analyses. Use of CHEMICALNOTIN in high doses was associated with statistically significant benefits on several measures. High-dose CHEMICALNOTIN (6 to 12 mg daily) was associated with a two-point improvement in cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog score compared with placebo (weighted mean difference -1.99, 95% confidence interval -2.49 to -1.50, on an intention-to-treat basis) and a 2.2 point improvement in activities of daily living assessed on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (weighted mean difference -2.15, 95% confidence interval -3.16 to -1.13, on an intention-to-treat basis) at 26 weeks. At lower doses (4 mg daily or lower) differences were in the same direction but were statistically significant only for cognitive function. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headache, syncope, abdominal pain and dizziness among patients taking high-dose CHEMICALNOTIN than among those taking placebo. There was some evidence that adverse events might be less common with more frequent, smaller doses of CHEMICALNOTIN. The 2008 update includes a new study testing two types of CHEMICALNOTIN transdermal patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested (17.4 mg/day) and a smaller patch delivering 9.6 mg/day. The efficacy of the smaller patch was not significantly different compared with the capsules of similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. The efficacy of the larger patch was not significantly different compared with the smaller patch, but the smaller patch was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. There appears to be advantages associated with the smaller patch compared with both the higher dose patch and the 6-12 mg/day capsules. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALNOTIN appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. Adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both. This review has not examined economic data.
12881227	GENENOTIN inhibition activates duodenal bicarbonate secretion in the rat. We examined the effect of inhibition of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) on duodenal bicarbonate secretion (DBS) in rats to further understand DBS regulation. DBS was measured by using the pH-stat method and by using CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive electrodes. CHEMICALIN (50 microM; CHEMICALIN), a concentration that selectively inhibits the GENEIN isoforms GENEIN and GENEIN, but not GENEIN, did not affect DBS. Nevertheless, 3 mM CHEMICALIN, a higher concentration that inhibits GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, significantly increased DBS. Moreover, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, both specific inhibitors of GENEIN only, or perfusion with CHEMICALNOTIN-free solutions, dose dependently increased DBS, as measured by pH-stat and CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive electrode, without affecting intracellular pH. Coperfusion with 0.1 microM CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.5 mM DIDS, or 1 mM CHEMICALNOTIN did not affect CHEMICALNOTIN-induced DBS. Nevertheless, coperfusion with 0.1 and 0.3 mM CHEMICALIN, which inhibits the GENEIN (GENEIN), dose dependently inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-induced DBS. In conclusion, only specific apical GENENOTIN inhibition increased DBS, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis, GENENOTIN activation, or intracellular CHEMICALIN- formation by GENEIN was not involved. Because GENENOTIN inhibition-increased DBS was inhibited by an GENENOTIN inhibitor and because reciprocal GENENOTIN regulation has been previously shown between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, we speculate that GENENOTIN inhibition increased DBS by altering aGENENOTIN function.
23418368	The Prevalence of Meeting A1C, Blood Pressure, and LDL Goals Among People With Diabetes, 1988-2010. OBJECTIVETo determine the prevalence of people with diabetes who meet hemoglobin A(1c) (A1C), blood pressure (BP), and LDL cholesterol (ABC) recommendations, and their current statin use, factors associated with goal achievement, and changes in the proportion achieving goals between 1988 and 2010.RESEARCH AND DESIGN METHODSData were cross-sectional from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES) from 1988-1994, 1999-2002, 2003-2006, and 2007-2010. Participants were 4,926 adults aged â¥20 years who self-reported a previous diagnosis of diabetes and completed the household interview and physical examination (n = 1,558 for valid LDL levels). Main outcome measures were A1C, BP, and LDL cholesterol, in accordance with the American Diabetes Association recommendations, and current use of statins.RESULTSIn 2007-2010, 52.5% of people with diabetes achieved A1C <7.0% (<53 mmol/mol), 51.1% achieved BP <130/80 mmHg, 56.2% achieved LDL <100 mg/dL, and 18.8% achieved all three ABCs. These levels of control were significant improvements from 1988 to 1994 (all P < 0.05). Statin use significantly increased between 1988-1994 (4.2%) and 2007-2010 (51.4%, P < 0.01). Compared with non-Hispanic whites, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals (P < 0.03), and non-Hispanic blacks were less likely to meet BP and LDL goals (P < 0.02). Compared with non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans were less likely to meet A1C goals (P < 0.01). Younger individuals were less likely to meet A1C and LDL goals.CONCLUSIONSDespite significant improvement during the past decade, achieving the ABC goals remains suboptimal among adults with diabetes, particularly in some minority groups. Substantial opportunity exists to further improve diabetes control and, thus, to reduce diabetes-related morbidity and mortality.
17561836	EphB1 null mice exhibit neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars reticulata and spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity. The molecular mechanisms that regulate basal ganglia development are largely unknown. Eph receptor tyrosine kinases are potential participants in this process as they regulate development of other CNS regions and are expressed in basal ganglia nuclei, such as the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. To address the role of Eph receptors in the development of these nuclei, we analysed anatomical changes in the SN and striatum of mice with null mutations for EphB1. These mice express beta-galactosidase as a marker for cells normally expressing EphB1. In situ hybridization data and a direct comparison of SN neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and/or the beta-gal marker for EphB1 revealed that EphB1 is not expressed in TH+ neurons of pars compacta (SNc), but is restricted to neurons in pars reticulata (SNr). Consistent with this, we find that EphB1 null mice exhibit a significant decrease in the volume and number of neurons (40% decrease) in SNr, whereas the volume and number of TH+ neurons in SNc is not significantly affected nor are there changes in the distribution of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. Although EphB1 is expressed in the striatum, EphB1-/- mice exhibit no significant changes in striatal volume and TH fiber density, and have no obvious alterations in striatal patch/matrix organization. Behavioral evaluation of EphB1 null mice in an open-field environment revealed that these mice exhibited spontaneous locomotor hyperactivity. These results suggest that EphB1 is necessary for the proper formation of SNr, and that neuronal loss in SNr is associated with altered locomotor functions.
23207322	pH-responsive composite microspheres based on magnetic mesoporous silica nanoparticle for drug delivery. pH-responsive composite microspheres, consisting of a core of Fe3O4 nanoparticle, a sandwiched layer of mesoporous silica and a shell of crosslinked poly (methacrylic acid) (PMAA), were successfully synthesized via distillation precipitation polymerization. The pKa of the composite microsphere increased with the increase in the crosslinking density. Doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) was applied as a model drug, and the behavior of drug storage/release was investigated. The cumulative release of DOX-loaded composite microsphere in vitro showed that the drug release rate was much faster below its pKa than that of above its pKa. Because pH of most tumor tissues was lower than that of normal tissues, the pH-responsive composite microspheres are promising drug delivery system especially for cancer therapy.
23608109	Novel therapeutic targets in non-small cell lung cancer. Oncogenic driver mutations frequently occur in lung cancer and play role in carcinogenesis. These mutations are usually associated with distinct clinical and histological features and are attractive targets for anticancer therapy. Recently, several molecularly distinct phenotypes of NSCLC based on specific and mutually exclusive genetic derangements have been described. Few targets like GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mutations and GENEIN (GENEIN) gene rearrangements have successfully been targeted with GENENOTIN GENENOTIN inhibitors (TKIs) and CHEMICALIN, respectively. Many more inhibitors of specific driver mutations involving genes like GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are currently under development. However, efforts to target some mutated genes like GENENOTIN have been unsuccessful. Moreover, the emerging challenge of acquired resistance to initially effective therapy is becoming another major concern. In this review recent data on novel molecular targets and their future prospects are discussed.
23249624	Mechanisms limiting distribution of the GENEIN(GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN to the brain: implications for the treatment of melanoma brain metastases. Brain metastases are a common cause of death in stage IV metastatic melanoma. Dabrafenib is a GENENOTIN (gene encoding GENENOTIN) inhibitor that has been developed to selectively target the CHEMICALIN 600 to CHEMICALIN substitution (GENEIN(GENENOTIN)), which is commonly found in metastatic melanoma. Clinical trials with CHEMICALNOTIN have shown encouraging results; however, the central nervous system distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN remains unknown. Thus, the objective of the current study was to evaluate the brain distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN in mice, and to see whether active efflux by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) restricts its delivery across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In vitro accumulation studies conducted in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells indicate that CHEMICALIN is an avid substrate for both GENEIN and GENEIN. Directional flux studies revealed greater transport in the basolateral to apical direction with corrected efflux ratios greater than 2 for both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transfected cell lines. In vivo, the ratio of area under the concentration-time curve (AUC)(brain) to AUC(plasma) (K(p)) of CHEMICALNOTIN after an i.v. dose (2.5 mg/kg) was 0.023, which increased by 18-fold in GENENOTIN(-/-)GENENOTIN(-/-) mice to 0.42. CHEMICALNOTIN plasma exposure was â¼2-fold greater in GENENOTIN(-/-)GENENOTIN(-/-) mice as compared with wild-type with an oral dose (25 mg/kg); however, the brain distribution was increased by ~10-fold with a resulting K(p) of 0.25. Further, compared with CHEMICALIN, another GENEIN(GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALNOTIN showed greater brain penetration with a similar dose. In conclusion, the CHEMICALNOTIN brain distribution is limited in an intact BBB model, and the data presented herein may have clinical implications in the prevention and treatment of melanoma brain metastases.
23330542	GENENOTIN antagonists and implication in drug metabolism. Adopted GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), plays a central role in the regulation of xeno- and endobiotic metabolism. Since the discovery of the functional role of GENENOTIN in 1998, there is evolving evidence for the role of GENENOTIN agonists in abrogating metabolic pathophysiology (e.g., cholestasis, hypercholesterolemia, and inflammation). However, more recently, it is clear that GENENOTIN is also an important mediator of adverse xeno- (e.g., enhances CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity) and endobiotic (e.g., hepatic steatosis) metabolic phenotypes. Moreover, in cancer therapeutics, GENENOTIN activation can induce drug resistance, and there is growing evidence for tissue-specific enhancement of the malignant phenotype. Thus, in these instances, there may be a role for GENENOTIN antagonists. However, as opposed to the discovery efforts for GENENOTIN agonists, there are only a few antagonists described. The mode of action of these antagonists (e.g., CHEMICALNOTIN) remains less clear. Our laboratory efforts have focused on this question. Since the original discovery of CHEMICALIN analogs as GENEIN antagonists, we have preliminarily defined an important GENEIN antagonist pharmacophore and developed less-toxic GENEIN antagonists. In this review, we describe our published and unpublished findings on recent structure-function studies involving the CHEMICALNOTIN chemical scaffold. Further work in the future is needed to fully define potent, more-selective GENENOTIN antagonists that may be useful in clinical application.
11160515	Biophysical properties, pharmacology, and modulation of human, neuronal L-type (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) voltage-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN currents. GENENOTIN (VDCCs) are multimeric complexes composed of a pore-forming alpha(1) subunit together with several accessory subunits, including alpha(2)delta, beta, and, in some cases, gamma subunits. A family of GENENOTIN known as the GENENOTIN are formed specifically from alpha(1S) (skeletal muscle), alpha(1C) (in heart and brain), alpha(1D) (mainly in brain, heart, and endocrine tissue), and alpha(1F) (retina). Neuroendocrine L-type currents have a significant role in the control of neurosecretion and can be inhibited by GENENOTIN. However, the subunit composition of the GENENOTIN underlying these GENENOTIN-regulated neuroendocrine L-type currents is unknown. To investigate the biophysical and pharmacological properties and role of GENENOTIN modulation of GENENOTIN, we have examined GENENOTIN currents formed by the GENENOTIN subunit, co-expressed with alpha(2)delta-1 and beta(3a), stably expressed in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line, using whole cell and perforated patch-clamp techniques. The alpha(1D)-expressing cell line exhibited L-type currents with typical characteristics. The currents were high-voltage activated (peak at +20 mV in 20 mM CHEMICALNOTIN) and showed little inactivation in external CHEMICALNOTIN, while displaying rapid inactivation kinetics in external CHEMICALNOTIN. The L-type currents were inhibited by the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) antagonists CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and were enhanced by the CHEMICALNOTIN agonist CHEMICALNOTIN. However, GENENOTIN L-type currents were not modulated by activation of a number of GENENOTIN pathways. Activation of endogenous GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN or activation of transiently transfected GENEIN (GENEIN(long)) by CHEMICALIN had no effect. Direct activation of G-proteins by the nonhydrolyzable CHEMICALNOTIN analogue, CHEMICALNOTIN also had no effect on the alpha(1D) currents. In contrast, in the same system, CHEMICALIN-type currents, formed from transiently transfected alpha(1B)/alpha(2)delta-1/beta(3), showed strong GENEIN-mediated inhibition. Furthermore, the I-II loop from the alpha(1D) clone, expressed as a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) fusion protein, did not bind Gbetagamma, unlike the GENENOTIN fusion protein. These data show that the biophysical and pharmacological properties of recombinant human alpha(1D) L-type currents are similar to alpha(1C) currents, and these currents are also resistant to modulation by GENENOTIN-linked GENENOTIN.
23403203	CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN gap junction disassembly in rat astrocytes involves GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN derived from Cryptocaryachinensis and Ficusseptica in the Asclepiadaceae milkweed family, is cytotoxic for various cancer cell lines. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment of rat primary astrocytes with CHEMICALNOTIN induced dose-dependent inhibition of gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC), as assessed by scrape-loading CHEMICALNOTIN dye transfer. Levels of GENEIN protein were also decreased in a dose- and time-dependent manner following CHEMICALIN treatment. Double-labeling immunofluorescence microscopy showed that CHEMICALNOTIN (10ng/ml) induced endocytosis of surface gap junctions into the cytoplasm, where GENENOTIN was co-localized with the early endosome marker GENENOTIN. Inhibition of lysosomes or proteasomes by co-treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN and their respective specific inhibitors, CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN, partially inhibited the antofine-induced decrease in GENEIN protein levels, but did not inhibit the antofine-induced inhibition of GJIC. After 30min of treatment, antofine induced a rapid increase in the intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentration and activation of GENENOTIN, which was maintained for at least 6h. Co-treatment of astrocytes with CHEMICALIN and the intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN chelator CHEMICALIN prevented downregulation of GENEIN and inhibition of GJIC. Moreover, co-treatment with CHEMICALIN and a specific GENENOTIN inhibitor prevented endocytosis of gap junctions, downregulation of GENEIN, and inhibition of GJIC. Taken together, these findings indicate that CHEMICALIN induces GENEIN gap junction disassembly by the GENEIN signaling pathway. Inhibition of GJIC by CHEMICALNOTIN may undermine the neuroprotective effect of astrocytes in CNS.
10406837	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN-induced vasoconstriction and intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN increase in the aorta of spontaneously hypertensive rats. CHEMICALNOTIN is a loop diuretic that is effective at low once-daily doses in the treatment of arterial hypertension. Because its antihypertensive mechanism of action may not be based entirely on the elimination of salt and water from the body, a vasodilator effect of this drug can be considered. In the present study, the ability of different concentrations of CHEMICALIN to modify GENEIN (GENEIN)-induced vascular responses was examined, with the use of an organ bath system, in endothelium-denuded aortic rings from spontaneously hypertensive rats. GENENOTIN-induced increases of intracellular free CHEMICALNOTIN concentration ([CHEMICALNOTIN](i)) were also examined by image analysis in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from spontaneously hypertensive rats. A dose-response curve to GENENOTIN was plotted for cumulative concentrations (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mol/L) in endothelium-denuded aortic rings (pD(2)=7.5+/-0.3). Isometric contraction induced by a submaximal concentration of GENEIN (10(-7) mol/L) was reduced in a dose-dependent way by CHEMICALIN (IC(50)=0.5+/-0.04 micromol/L). Incubation of VSMCs with different concentrations of GENENOTIN (from 10(-10) to 10(-6) mol/L) resulted in a dose-dependent rise of [CHEMICALNOTIN](i) (pD(2)=7.5+/-0.3). The stimulatory effect of [CHEMICALNOTIN](i) induced by a submaximal concentration of GENEIN (10(-7) mol/L) was blocked by CHEMICALIN (IC(50)=0.5+/-0.3 nmol/L). Our findings suggest that CHEMICALIN blocks the vasoconstrictor action of GENEIN in vitro. This action can be related to the ability of CHEMICALIN to block the increase of [CHEMICALNOTIN](i) induced by GENEIN in VSMCs. It is proposed that these actions might be involved in the antihypertensive effect of CHEMICALNOTIN observed in vivo.
23262271	Characterization of GENENOTIN inhibitors in the twigs of Cudrania tricuspidata and their structure-activity relationship study. The twigs of Cudrania tricuspidata were found to show strong GENENOTIN inhibitory activity, and further detailed component analysis resulted in the isolation of a new CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (1), plus twenty-seven known compounds (2-28). Their structures were elucidated on the basis of ESI-MS and NMR spectral data. Among the isolated compounds, CHEMICALIN (8), CHEMICALIN (9), and CHEMICALIN (12) were found to exhibit significant GENEIN inhibition activities. Moreover, the structure-activity relationship of these isolated compounds was also discussed.
17216302	Pyridoxal 5'-phosphate may be curative in early-onset epileptic encephalopathy. Neonatal epileptic encephalopathy can be caused by inborn errors of metabolism. These conditions are often unresponsive to treatment with conventional antiepileptic drugs. Six children with pyridox(am)ine-5'-phosphate oxidase (PNPO) deficiency presented with neonatal epileptic encephalopathy. Two were treated with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) within the first month of life and showed normal development or moderate psychomotor retardation thereafter. Four children with late or no treatment died or showed severe mental handicap. All of the children showed atypical biochemical findings. Prompt treatment with PLP in all neonates and infants with epileptic encephalopathy should become mandatory, permitting normal development in at least some of those affected with PNPO deficiency.
10670413	The CHEMICALIN series modulates GENEIN probably through the GENEIN in rat paratracheal ganglia. The modulation of GENEIN by the CHEMICALIN series (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) was studied in the paratracheal ganglion cells. CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALIN (a stable analogue of CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (an GENEIN-selective agonist) and CHEMICALIN (an GENEIN-selective agonist) inhibited the HVA CHEMICALNOTIN current (HVA ICa) dose-dependently, and the rank order of potency to inhibit GENEIN was CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN>>CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN (10(-5) M), a selective GENEIN antagonist, showed no effect on the CHEMICALNOTIN- or CHEMICALNOTIN-induced inhibition of the HVA ICa, thereby indicating that CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-induced inhibition of the GENEIN is possibly mediated by the GENEIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive component of the current was markedly reduced in the presence of omega-conotoxin-GVIA (3x10(-6) M), but not with CHEMICALNOTIN (3x10(-6) M). CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN also inhibited the remaining ICa in a saturating concentration of CHEMICALNOTIN, omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-conotoxin-MVIIC, suggesting that GENEIN are involved. The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN was prevented by pretreatment with GENENOTIN [GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)] or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), and the GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN blocked the action of CHEMICALNOTIN. It was concluded that CHEMICALIN selectively reduces both N- and R-type CHEMICALNOTIN currents by activating a GENEIN probably through the GENEIN in paratracheal ganglion cells.
11936838	Inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN transcription and translation by CHEMICALIN in muscle tissue infected with the parasite Trichinella spiralis. CHEMICALNOTIN is a non-toxic plant CHEMICALNOTIN which is an effective inhibitor of DNA replication by acting at the S-phase. In this study we infected mice with T. spiralis, a nematode parasite, and studied the inflammatory response through the determination of GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, a GENENOTIN in the inflamed area around the parasitic cyst. The animals were infected and their diaphragms were tested for inflammatory response. GENEIN and GENEIN was tested after 1, 10, 20, 30, and 40 days post inoculation, before and after CHEMICALIN treatment. The inflammatory index was calculated by counting the white blood cells around the nematode cysts, while expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was calculated by ELISA method and transcription by Northern blot and RT-PCR. Here we found that CHEMICALNOTIN strongly inhibited the inflammatory index in the diaphragmatic tissue at 10, 20, 30 and 40 days post-treatment. In these experiments, CHEMICALNOTIN had no effect on the number of cysts produced. In addition, we found that GENEIN transcription and translation was completely inhibited by CHEMICALIN, while GENEIN transcription and translation was partially inhibited at 30 and 40 days; yet it was totally inhibited after 10 and 20 days in encysted diaphragm tissue infected by T. spiralis. Our studies suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN has an inhibitory effect through the inhibition of cytoplasmatic serine hydroxymethyltransferase altering the cell cycle of white blood cells. This study suggests for the first time the premise that CHEMICALNOTIN acts as an anti-inflammatory compound.
23422872	Balancing societal needs and regulatory certainty: the case study of CHEMICALNOTIN in Japan. Regulators must balance societal and medical requirements against the need for certainty about benefit and risk for new medicines. This is described in a case study of the expedited review and approval of CHEMICALIN, a novel GENEIN inhibitor, in Japan in the context of the emergence of new strain of influenza in 2009. The case illustrates the importance of regulatory science and transparency in supporting such decision making.
23238783	The influence of sex, ethnicity, and GENEIN genotype on CHEMICALIN metabolism as an index of hepatic GENENOTIN activity in humans. The effects of sex, ethnicity, and genetic polymorphism on hepatic GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression and activity were previously demonstrated in vitro. Race/ethnic differences in GENENOTIN genotype and phenotype were observed only in women. To identify important covariates associated with interindividual variation in GENENOTIN activity in vivo, we evaluated these effects in healthy volunteers using CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN GlaxoSmithKline, Research Triangle Park, NC) as a GENEIN probe substrate. A fixed 150-mg oral sustained-release dose of CHEMICALNOTIN was administered to 100 healthy volunteers comprising four sex/ethnicity cohorts (n = 25 each): Caucasian men and Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic women. Blood samples were obtained at 0 and 6 hours postdose for the measurement of serum CHEMICALNOTIN (BU) and CHEMICALNOTIN (HB) concentrations. Whole blood was obtained at baseline for GENENOTIN genotyping. To characterize the relationship between GENENOTIN activity and ethnicity, sex, and genotype when accounting for serum BU concentrations (dose-adjusted log(10)-transformed), analysis of covariance model was fitted in which the dependent variable was GENENOTIN activity represented as the log(10)-transformed, metabolic ratio of HB to BU concentrations. Several GENENOTIN polymorphisms were associated with GENENOTIN activity. Evidence of dependence of GENENOTIN activity on ethnicity or genotype-by-ethnicity interactions was not detected in women. These results suggest that GENEIN genotype is the most important patient variable for predicting the level of GENEIN activity in women, when measured by the metabolism of CHEMICALIN. The CHEMICALIN metabolic ratio appears to detect known differences in GENEIN activity associated with genetic polymorphism, across different ethnic groups. Prospective studies will be needed to validate the use of CHEMICALNOTIN as a probe substrate for clinical use.
8819507	GENENOTIN subtype causing CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated vascular relaxation in rats. The GENENOTIN subtype and its signal transduction pathway mediating vascular relaxation in rats were studied in vitro using rings of superior mesenteric arteries. Removal of endothelium or incubation with CHEMICALNOTIN completely blocked relaxant responses to CHEMICALNOTIN, suggesting endothelium-derived CHEMICALNOTIN mediates relaxation. The order of potency for full (F) or partial (P) agonists causing relaxation was CHEMICALNOTIN (P) > CHEMICALNOTIN (F) > CHEMICALNOTIN (P) > CHEMICALNOTIN (F) > CHEMICALNOTIN (F). Affinities (Ka) of GENENOTIN subtype-selective drugs for blocking relaxation were obtained in side-by-side experiments comparing rat mesenteric arteries with pig coronary arteries. Relaxation of pig coronary arteries is known to be mediated by the GENENOTIN subtype. Ka values in nM for CHEMICALIN (19), CHEMICALIN (265), CHEMICALIN (197), CHEMICALIN (128), and CHEMICALIN (1531) for blocking relaxation in rat arteries were consistent with their affinities for binding at the GENEIN subtype. Ka values for CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, drugs distinguishing the alpha-2D from the GENEIN subtype, were significantly higher in blocking relaxation of rat arteries compared with pig arteries, suggesting the GENENOTIN subtype mediates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced relaxation in rat arteries. We used CHEMICALNOTIN to oppose GENENOTIN-mediated inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN formation by directly stimulating CHEMICALNOTIN formation in endothelium. CHEMICALNOTIN did not affect the relaxant response to CHEMICALNOTIN, suggesting that CHEMICALIN is not involved in the coupling of GENEIN to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced vascular relaxation.
23199998	Determination of paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins by HILIC-MS/MS coupled with dispersive solid phase extraction. This paper describes the use of QuEChERS (Quick, Easy, Cheap, Effective, Rugged and Safe) for the extraction, cleanup and detection of 10 paralytic shellfish toxins (PSP) in sea food by HILIC-MS/MS with positive ESI. Matrix matched calibration standards were used to compensate for matrix effects. The toxins were extracted with acetonitrile/water (90:10, v/v) containing 0.1% formic acid and cleaned by HLB and GCB sorbents. Qualitative and quantitative detection for the analytes were carried out under the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) in positive ionization mode after chromatography separation on a TSK-gel Amide-80Â® column (150 mmÃ2.0 mmÃ3 Î¼m). Studies at three fortification levels for the toxins in the range of 8.1-225.5 Î¼g/kg gave mean recoveries from 71.3% to 104.6% with relative standard deviation (RSD) â¤ 15.8%. The limit of detection (LOD) was below the recommended regulatory limit of 170 Î¼gSTX(equ.)/kg and the proposed method fully meets the needs of daily monitoring.
17192395	Comparative gene expression profiling of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes and erythroblasts identifies novel activatory and inhibitory platelet membrane proteins. To identify previously unknown GENENOTIN we compared the transcriptomes of in vitro differentiated megakaryocytes (MKs) and erythroblasts (EBs). RNA was obtained from purified, biologically paired MK and EB cultures and compared using cDNA microarrays. Bioinformatical analysis of MK-up-regulated genes identified 151 transcripts encoding transmembrane domain-containing proteins. Although many of these were known platelet genes, a number of previously unidentified or poorly characterized transcripts were also detected. Many of these transcripts, including GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, encode proteins with structural features or functions that suggest they may be involved in the modulation of platelet function. Immunoblotting on platelets confirmed the presence of the encoded proteins, and flow cytometric analysis confirmed the expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN on the surface of platelets. Through comparative analysis of expression in platelets and other blood cells we demonstrated that GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN are restricted to the platelet lineage, whereas GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were also detected in other blood cells. The identification of the GENEIN GENEIN in platelets is of particular interest, because physiologically relevant concentrations of CHEMICALIN were shown to potentiate the effect of low doses of a variety of platelet agonists.
10826417	CHEMICALNOTIN: safe and effective treatment for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. BACKGROUND: Ogilvie's syndrome, or acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, is a common and relatively dangerous condition. If left untreated, it may cause ischemic necrosis and colonic perforation, with a mortality rate as high as 50 percent. CHEMICALIN enhances excitatory parasympathetic activity by competing with CHEMICALIN for attachment to GENEIN at sites of cholinergic transmission and enhancing cholinergic action. We hypothesized that CHEMICALNOTIN would restore peristalsis in patients with acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients at Fletcher Allen Health Care and The Cleveland Clinic Foundation were treated for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction with CHEMICALNOTIN 2.5 mg IV over 3 minutes while being monitored with telemetry. Mechanical obstruction had been excluded. RESULTS: Complete clinical resolution of large bowel distention occurred in 26 of the 28 patients. Time to pass flatus varied from 30 seconds to 10 minutes after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. No adverse effects or complications were noted. Of the two patients who did not resolve, one had a sigmoid cancer that required resection and one patient died from multiorgan failure. CONCLUSION: This study supports the theory that acute colonic pseudo-obstruction is the result of excessive parasympathetic suppression rather than sympathetic overactivity. We have shown that CHEMICALNOTIN is a safe and effective treatment for acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.
23100158	Apoptosis initiation of CHEMICALIN in SGC-7901 gastric carcinoma cancer cells via a GENEIN-GENEIN pathway. CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to hold potent anti-proliferative and apoptosis induction properties in vitro and in vivo. To investigate the effects of CHEMICALIN on apoptosis initiation and its possible mechanisms of action, we qualified cell apoptosis, proteins related to apoptosis and a GENEIN (GENEIN)-GENEIN pathway in human gastric adenocarcinoma cancer SGC-7901 cells. The results demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in SGC-7901 cells treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (25, 50, 100 and 200Â Î¼mol/L) for 24Â h. CHEMICALIN was also shown to induce the expression of cleaved-GENEIN and inhibit GENEIN expression in SGC-7901 cells in a dose-dependent manner. The significantly decreased levels of GENEIN and GENEIN expression were observed in SGC-7901 cells after CHEMICALIN treatments in a time- and dose-dependent manner (PÂ <Â 0.01). Thus, the apoptosis induction in SGC-7901 cells by CHEMICALIN may be regulated through a GENEIN-GENEIN pathway. These results demonstrate a potential mechanism by which CHEMICALNOTIN to induce apoptosis initiation in SGC-7901 cells.
12517247	CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of hypertension. Antihypertensive agents are proven to reduce the cardiovascular risk of stroke, coronary heart disease and cardiac failure. The ideal antihypertensive agent should control all grades of hypertension and have a placebo-like side effect profile. GENENOTIN antagonists are a relatively new class of antihypertensive agent that block GENENOTIN, and reduce the pressor effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects compared with GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure. However, GENENOTIN blockers differ from GENENOTIN inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, a side effect which may be related to CHEMICALNOTIN or other mediators such as CHEMICALNOTIN. Within the class of GENEIN blockers, CHEMICALIN differs from other currently available agents in terms of chemical structure, as it is a non-CHEMICALNOTIN, non-CHEMICALNOTIN, non-peptide antagonist with a dual pharmacological mode of action. CHEMICALIN acts at vascular GENEIN (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic GENEIN, where it inhibits sympathetically stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN release. Its lack of metabolism by GENENOTIN enzymes confers a low potential for metabolic drug interactions and may be of importance when treating elderly patients and those on multiple drugs. In clinical trials, CHEMICALNOTIN has been demonstrated to be at least as effective in reducing blood pressure as the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN, and has significantly lower side effects. CHEMICALNOTIN is safe, effective and well-tolerated in long-term treatment, either as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as CHEMICALNOTIN.
17040106	Reductive detoxification of CHEMICALIN carcinogens by GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN carcinogens are thought to lead to tumor initiation via the formation of DNA adducts, and bioactivation to CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites is necessary for reactivity with DNA. Carcinogenic CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites are cleared by a microsomal, CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent, CHEMICALNOTIN-insensitive reduction pathway in humans, which may be a source of interindividual variability in response to CHEMICALNOTIN carcinogens. The purpose of this study was to characterize the identity of this reduction pathway in human liver. On the basis of our findings with structurally similar CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites of therapeutic drugs, we hypothesized that the reductive detoxification of CHEMICALIN carcinogens was catalyzed by GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). We found that reduction of the carcinogenic CHEMICALIN of the CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; found in cigarette smoke) and the CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; found in grilled meats) was indeed catalyzed by a purified system containing only GENEIN and GENEIN. Specific activities were 56-346-fold higher in the purified system as compared to human liver microsomes (HLM), with similar Michaelis-Menten constants (K(m) values) in both systems. The stoichiometry for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN that yielded the highest activity in the purified system was also similar to that found in native HLM ( approximately 1:8 to 1:10). Polyclonal antisera to either GENEIN or GENEIN significantly inhibited CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) reduction by 95 and 89%, respectively, and immunoreactive cyt b5 protein content in individual HLM was significantly correlated with individual reduction of both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Finally, titration of HLM into the purified GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN system did not enhance the efficiency of reduction activity. We conclude that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are together solely capable of the reduction of CHEMICALNOTIN carcinogens, and we further hypothesize that this pathway may be a source of individual variability with respect to cancer susceptibility following CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN exposure.
23485065	Conformation Guides Molecular Efficacy in Docking Screens of Activated Î²-2 Adrenergic G Protein Coupled Receptor. A prospective, large library virtual screen against an activated Î²2-adrenergic receptor (Î²2AR) structure returned potent agonists to the exclusion of inverse-agonists, providing the first complement to the previous virtual screening campaigns against inverse-agonist-bound G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) structures, which predicted only inverse-agonists. In addition, two hits recapitulated the signaling profile of the co-crystal ligand with respect to the G protein and arrestin mediated signaling. This functional fidelity has important implications in drug design, as the ability to predict ligands with predefined signaling properties is highly desirable. However, the agonist-bound state provides an uncertain template for modeling the activated conformation of other GPCRs, as a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) activated model templated on the activated Î²2AR structure returned few hits of only marginal potency.
7837275	Conformational transitions linked to active site ligation in GENENOTIN: effect on the interaction with GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN. An experimental strategy based on solution viscosity perturbation allowed us to study the energetics of CHEMICALNOTIN-substrates, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN binding to the catalytic site of two proteolyzed forms of GENEIN, i.e. GENENOTIN. These GENENOTIN derivatives are cleaved at the Leu144-Gly150 loop and at the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), respectively. A phenomenological analysis of thermodynamic data showed that the CHEMICALNOTIN substrates and CHEMICALIN interactions with GENEIN were respectively, associated with a chemical compensation (i.e. the linear relationship between entropy and enthalpy of binding) and a hydrophobic phenomenon (i.e. a change in the standard heat capacity). The latter was slightly lower than that previously observed for a GENENOTIN (0.78 +/- 0.25 versus 1.01 +/- 0.17 kcal/mol K). Both phenomenon were absent in gamma T-thrombin. The interaction of a GENENOTIN with macromolecular substrates that "bridge-bind" to both the catalytic site (CS) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), such as GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), was also evaluated. These interactions were studied by following GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) release and by measuring intraplatelet CHEMICALNOTIN changes induced by GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interaction. It was found that the free energy of activation (RT ln Kcat/Km) for both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN hydrolysis followed the same hierarchy, i.e. alpha > zeta > gamma. Moreover, the values of delta Cp for GENENOTIN interaction with CHEMICALNOTIN were found to be linearly correlated to the free energy of activation for both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN cleavage. In conclusion, these data demonstrate that: (1) the Leu144-Gly150 loop and the GENENOTIN are both involved in the conformational transition linked to the binding of CHEMICALIN to the GENEIN active site; (2) the extent of GENENOTIN capacity to undergo conformational transitions in alpha-, zeta- and gamma T forms is positively correlated to the free energy of activation for hydrolysis of macromolecular substrates interacting with both the catalytic domain and the GENENOTIN.
11103886	Neuropsychological and conditioned blocking performance in patients with schizophrenia: assessment of the contribution of neuroleptic dose, serum levels and dopamine D2-receptor occupancy. Patients with schizophrenia show impairments of attention and neuropsychological performance, but the extent to which this is attributable to antipsychotic medication remains largely unexplored. We describe here the putative influence of the dose of antipsychotic medication (chlorpromazine equivalents, CPZ), the antipsychotic serum concentration of dopamine (DA) D2-blocking activity and the approximated central dopamine D2-receptor occupancy (DA D2-occupancy), on conditioned blocking (CB) measures of attention and performance on a neuropsychological battery, in 108 patients with schizophrenia (compared with 62 healthy controls). Antipsychotic serum concentration and D2-occupancy were higher in patients with a paranoid versus non-paranoid diagnosis, and in female versus male patients (independent of symptom severity). Controlling for D2-occupancy removed the difference between high CB in paranoid and impaired low CB in non-paranoid patients. Similar partial correlations for antipsychotic drug dose and serum levels of DA D2-blocking activity with performance of the trail-making and picture completion tests (negative) and the block-design task (positive) showed the functional importance of DA-related activity. High estimates of central DA D2-occupancy were related to impaired verbal fluency but were associated with improved recall of stories, especially in paranoid patients. This, the first study of its kind, tentatively imputes a role for DA D2-related activity in left frontal (e.g. CB, verbal fluency) and temporal lobe functions (verbal recall) as well as in some non-verbal abilities mediated more in the right hemisphere in patients with schizophrenia.
11264758	Clinical effects of CHEMICALIN, an oral GENEIN antagonist, in mild-to-moderate asthma: a 4 week randomized multicentre controlled trial. OBJECTIVE: CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists are increasingly used in asthma management. CHEMICALIN is a new, orally active, selective inhibitor of GENEIN GENEIN. The present clinical trial was performed to study the effect and safety of CHEMICALNOTIN in mild-to-moderate asthma. METHODOLOGY: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study was performed in eight medical centres in Korea. Mild-to-moderate asthma patients who had been treated with beta2-agonists and/or inhaled CHEMICALNOTIN were studied. The patients' symptoms were evaluated by asthma diary and twice-daily peak flow monitoring. RESULTS: Of the 206 patients enrolled, 197 were eligible for analysis. The CHEMICALNOTIN group (n = 98) showed statistically significant improvement in asthma symptoms, including asthma attack rate, daily living score, and morning and evening asthma scores. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly reduced the consumption of beta2-agonist. Compared with the placebo group, forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) were not significantly higher in the CHEMICALNOTIN group. Morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF) were significantly increased after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment at weeks 2 and 4 (380.8 +/- 10.1 L/min at baseline, 394.5 +/- 10.1 at week 2, 396.3 +/- 10.4 at week 4). There were no serious adverse reactions. CONCLUSION: CHEMICALNOTIN, an oral CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist, was well tolerated and was effective for the management of mild-to-moderate asthma.
23122081	Physicochemical parameters that influence carotenoids bioaccessibility from a tomato juice. In vitro digestion models have been developed to estimate carotenoid bioavailability but most do not consider that their diffusion from fruit matrix to the lipid phase of the bolus could be a limiting step. Therefore we designed a model in which tomato juice is mixed with oil or oil/water emulsions, and the carotenoids diffusing to oil are measured by spectrometry. Temperature, pH and tomato juice/peanut oil ratio were evaluated for their influence on carotenoid diffusion. When oil/tomato ratio was between 0.11 and 1, extraction of lycopene was limited by the saturation of the oil phase. With a large excess of oil, diffusion was also limited, as only 31 Â± 1% of lycopene could be extracted from the juice. Diffusion did not vary significantly with pH but doubled when temperature rose from 10Â°C to 37Â°C. When the juice was mixed in an emulsion stabilised with bovine serum albumin or phospholipids the maximum extraction decreased to 14.5 Â± 0.2% and 18.5 Â± 1.5% respectively, indicating that in addition to the saturation of the oil phase at low oil/tomato ratio and in addition to intrinsic properties of the tomato juice in non-saturating conditions, lycopene diffusion was limited by the structure of the interface in emulsions.
23587649	Acute and chronic interference with BDNF/TrkB-signaling impair LTP selectively at mossy fiber synapses in the CA3 region of mouse hippocampus. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling via TrkB crucially regulates synaptic plasticity in the brain. Although BDNF is abundant at hippocampal mossy fiber (MF) synapses, which critically contribute to hippocampus dependent memory, its role in MF synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation, LTP) remained largely unclear. Using field potential recordings in CA3 of adult heterozygous BDNF knockout (ko, BDNF+/-) mice we observed impaired (â¼50%) NMDAR-independent MF-LTP. In contrast to MF synapses, LTP at neighboring associative/commissural (A/C) fiber synapses remained unaffected. To exclude that impaired MF-LTP in BDNF+/- mice was due to developmental changes in response to chronically reduced BDNF levels, and to prove the importance of acute availability of BDNF in MF-LTP, we also tested effects of acute interference with BDNF/TrkB signaling. Inhibition of TrkB tyrosine kinase signaling with k252a, or with the selective BDNF scavenger TrkB-Fc, both inhibited MF-LTP to the same extent as observed in BDNF+/- mice. Basal synaptic transmission, short-term plasticity, and synaptic fatigue during LTP induction were not significantly altered by treatment with k252a or TrkB-Fc, or by chronic BDNF reduction in BDNF+/- mice. Since the acute interference with BDNF-signaling did not completely block MF-LTP, our results provide evidence that an additional mechanism besides BDNF induced TrkB signaling contributes to this type of LTP. Our results prove for the first time a mechanistic action of acute BDNF/TrkB signaling in presynaptic expression of MF-LTP in adult hippocampus.
16291873	Drug binding interactions in the inner cavity of GENEIN channels: molecular insights from structure-activity relationships of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN analogs. Block of GENENOTIN by otherwise useful drugs is the most common cause of long QT syndrome, a disorder of cardiac repolarization that predisposes patients to potentially fatal arrhythmias. This undesirable long QT side effect has been a major reason for the withdrawal of medications from the pharmaceutical market. Understanding the molecular basis of GENENOTIN block is therefore essential to facilitate the design of safe drugs. Binding sites for GENEIN blockers have been mapped within the inner cavity of the channel and include aromatic residues in the S6 helix (CHEMICALIN-652, CHEMICALIN-656) and residues in the pore helix (CHEMICALIN-623, CHEMICALIN-624, CHEMICALIN-625). We used mutagenesis of these residues, combined with an investigation of GENEIN block by close analogs of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, to assess how specific alterations in drug structure affected potency and binding interactions. Although changing the basic CHEMICALNOTIN from quaternary to tertiary accelerated the onset of block, the IC(50) and kinetics for recovery from block were similar. In contrast, analogs with different para-substituents on the CHEMICALIN ring had significantly different potencies for wild-type GENEIN block. The highest potency was achieved with polar or electronegative para-substituents, whereas neutral para-substituents had potencies more than 100-fold lower. Results from mutagenesis and molecular modeling studies suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN ring para-substituents influence drug interactions with CHEMICALNOTIN-623, CHEMICALNOTIN-624, and CHEMICALNOTIN-652 and strongly affect binding affinity. Together, these findings suggest that modifying the para-substituent could be a useful strategy for reducing hERG potency and increasing the safety margin of compounds in development.
23334864	Iron overload inhibits osteoblast biological activity through oxidative stress. Iron overload has recently been connected with bone mineral density in osteoporosis. However, to date, the effect of iron overload on osteoblasts remains poorly understood. The purpose of this study is to examine osteoblast biological activity under iron overload. The osteoblast cells (hFOB1.19) were cultured in a medium supplemented with different concentrations (50, 100, and 200Â Î¼M) of ferric ammonium citrate as a donor of ferric ion. Intracellular iron was measured with a confocal laser scanning microscope. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected by 2,7-dichlorofluorescin diacetate fluorophotometry. Osteoblast biological activities were evaluated by measuring the activity of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and mineralization function. Results indicated that iron overload could consequently increase intracellular iron concentration and intracellular ROS levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, ALP activity was suppressed, and a decline in the number of mineralized nodules was observed in in vitro cultured osteoblast cells. According to these results, it seems that iron overload probably inhibits osteoblast function through higher oxidative stress following increased intracellular iron concentrations.
9509999	Adrenergic agonists suppress the proliferation of microglia through beta 2-adrenergic receptor. The effects of several cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-elevating agents on the proliferation of cultured rat microglia were investigated by immunocytochemical staining with an antibody against proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Epinephrine, isoproterenol, forskolin and 8Br-cAMP suppressed the microglial proliferation. A beta2-selective agonist terbutaline but not a beta1-selective agonist dobutamine mimicked the effect of the above cAMP-elevating agents. Furthermore, a non-selective beta-receptor antagonist oxprenolol and a beta2-selective antagonist acebutalol, but not a beta1-selective antagonist butoxamine, counteracted the suppressive effects of the beta-agonists on microglial proliferation. These findings suggest that the beta-agonists suppress the proliferation of microglia by elevating intracellular cAMP level through an action on beta2-adrenergic receptor.
23314331	Copper induced upregulation of apoptosis related genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio) gill. Copper (Cu) is an essential micronutrient that, when present in high concentrations, becomes toxic to aquatic organisms. It is known that Cu toxicity may induce apoptotic cell death. However, the precise mechanism and the pathways that are activated, in fish, are still unclear. Thus, this study aimed to assess which apoptotic pathways are triggered by Cu, in zebrafish (Danio rerio) gill, the main target of waterborne pollutants. Fish where exposed to 12.5 and 100 Î¼g/L of Cu during 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. Fish gills were collected to TUNEL assay and mRNA expression analysis of selected genes by real time PCR. An approach to different apoptosis pathways was done selecting p53, caspase-8, caspase-9 and apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) genes. The higher incidence of TUNEL-positive cells, in gill epithelia of the exposed fish, proved that Cu induced apoptosis. The results suggest that different apoptosis pathways are triggered by Cu at different time points of the exposure period, as the increase in transcripts was sequential, instead of simultaneous. Apoptosis seems to be initiated via intrinsic pathway (caspase-9), through p53 activation; then followed by the extrinsic pathway (caspase-8) and finally by the caspase-independent pathway (AIF). A possible model for Cu-induce apoptosis pathways is proposed.
17390078	Gene expression signature of CHEMICALNOTIN-transformed human breast epithelial cells. Environmental substances seem to be involved in the etiology of breast cancers. Many studies have found an association between human cancer and exposure to agricultural pesticides such as the CHEMICALNOTIN pesticides. CHEMICALIN is a GENEIN inhibitor that induces the hydrolysis of body CHEMICALNOTIN, including CHEMICALNOTIN at cholinergic synapses. The primary target of action in insects is the nervous system whereby pesticides inhibit the release of the enzyme GENENOTIN at the synaptic junction. Atropine is a parasympatholytic alkaloid used as an antidote to GENENOTIN inhibitors. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on cell transformation of human breast epithelial cells in vitro. These studies showed that CHEMICALNOTIN alone was able to induce malignant transformation of an immortalized human breast epithelial cell line, MCF-10F as indicated by increased cell proliferation, anchorage independency and invasive capabilities. There was also an increase in GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENENOTIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and mutant GENEIN protein expression in the CHEMICALIN-treated cells. However, CHEMICALNOTIN significantly inhibited this increase. In a human cell cycle array of 96 genes, 13 of them were altered by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Among the genes affected were the GENENOTIN, such as GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) such as GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. It is suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN influences human breast epithelial cell transformation and is an initiator factor in the transformation process in breast cancer.
9722550	Purification and multimeric structure of bovine GENENOTIN. GENEIN (GENEIN; GENEIN) catalyzes the second step in the synthesis of the CHEMICALIN determinant required for efficient intracellular targeting of newly synthesized lysosomal hydrolases to the lysosome. A partially purified preparation of GENENOTIN from bovine pancreas was used to generate a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies. The anti-GENENOTIN monoclonal antibody UC1 was coupled to a solid support and used to immunopurify the bovine liver enzyme 670,000-fold in two steps to apparent homogeneity with an overall yield of 14%. The purified GENEIN has a specific activity of 498 micromol of CHEMICALIN cleaved per h per mg of protein using 0.5 mM CHEMICALIN as substrate. The subunit structure of the enzyme was determined using a combination of analytical gel filtration chromatography, CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN gel electrophoresis, and amino-terminal sequencing. The data indicate that bovine GENENOTIN is a 272,000-Da complex of four identical 68,000-Da glycoprotein subunits arranged as two CHEMICALNOTIN-linked homodimers. A soluble form of the enzyme, isolated from fetal bovine serum, showed the same subunit structure. Both forms of the enzyme reacted with a rabbit antibody raised to the CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal peptide of the liver enzyme, suggesting that GENEIN is a GENEIN with its CHEMICALIN terminus in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus.
23339678	Impact of ketorolac administration around ovarian stimulation on in vivo and in vitro fertilization and subsequent embryo development. Abstract We performed this study to investigate the effect of ketorolac (a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug) administration around ovarian stimulation on in vivo and in vitro fertilization process. Sixty-four female mice (ICR) were injected with ketorolac (0, 7.5, 15 and 30âÂµg/d) for 3âd starting from the day of eCG treatment. In experiment 1, 41 mice were triggered by hCG and then mated; two-cell embryos were obtained and in vitro development up to blastocyst was observed. In experiment 2, 23 mice were triggered by hCG and mature oocytes were collected; in vitro fertilization rate and subsequent embryo development up to blastocyst was recorded. In experiment 1, the blastocyst-forming rates per in vivo fertilized two-cell embryo showed an inverse relationship with a dosage of ketorolac (97.6%, 64.2%, 35.4% and 25.9%). In experiment 2, degenerated oocytes were frequently observed in a dose-dependent manner (4.3%, 22.9%, 22.4% and 75.0%). Lower fertilization rates were noted in all the three ketorolac-treating groups; blastocyst-forming rate was significantly lower in 30-Âµg-treating group when compared with the control group. Administration of ketorolac around ovarian stimulation significantly affects the development of in vivo fertilized embryo in a dose-dependent manner. High-dose ketorolac could result in a poor oocyte quality and decreased embryo developmental competence.
22776694	Passive stiffness of airway smooth muscle: the next target for improving airway distensibility and treatment for asthma? Reduced airway distensibility due to increased airway stiffness is a characteristic of asthma. Airway stiffness is determined by the property and structural organization of the various elements of the airway wall, and is often divided into active and passive components. Active stiffness is thought to be associated with activation of muscle cells in the airway wall. This component of stiffness can be inhibited when active force produced by the muscle is abolished. Passive stiffness, on the other hand, is thought to stem from non-muscle component of the airway wall, especially the collagen/elastin fibrous network of the extracellular matrix within which the muscle cells are embedded. In this brief review, the notion that passive stiffness is exclusively extracellular in origin is challenged. Recent evidence suggests that a substantial portion of the passive stiffness of an in vitro preparation of tracheal smooth muscle is calcium sensitive and is regulated by Rho-kinase, although the underlying mechanism and the details of regulation for the development of this intracellular passive stiffness are still largely unknown. To reduce airway stiffness different lines of attack must be tailored to different components of the stiffness. The regulatable passive stiffness is distinct from the relatively permanent stiffness of the extracellular matrix and the stiffness associated with active muscle contraction. To improve airway distensibility during asthma exacerbation, a comprehensive approach to reduce overall airway stiffness should therefore include a strategy for targeting the regulatable passive stiffness.
23500382	The vascular protective properties of CHEMICALNOTIN isolated from Anoectochilus roxburghii under high CHEMICALNOTIN condition. Anoectochilus roxburghii is a traditional Chinese herb used for the treatment of diabetes and some other diseases. The vascular protective effect of its major active ingredient, CHEMICALNOTIN, in high CHEMICALNOTIN conditions was investigated in in vivo and in vitro experiments. In in vivo tests, CHEMICALNOTIN (50 and 100mg/kg) efficiently lowered blood CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels and it enhanced the oxidation resistance of diabetic mice induced by CHEMICALNOTIN. In the in vitro assay, CHEMICALIN (20 and 50Î¼g/mL) markedly inhibited changes in various biochemical substances (CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), and GENEIN (GENEIN)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) damaged by high CHEMICALIN (35mM) and restored vascular endothelial structure by balancing the GENEIN-the GENEIN (GENEIN-GENEINP) system. The vascular protective effects of CHEMICALIN were speculated to be attributed to oxidative stress inhibition and the reduction of GENEIN (GENEIN) mRNA expression levels in high CHEMICALNOTIN conditions. Moreover, histological examination, including CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN (H&E) staining, masson trichrome (Masson) staining, and periodic Schiff-CHEMICALNOTIN (PASM) staining, greatly supported the morphological and functional amelioration of diabetes-related changes in mice aortas after CHEMICALNOTIN (20 and 50Î¼g/mL) treatment. These results indicated that CHEMICALNOTIN might be a promising agent for the treatment of diabetic vascular disease.
23337607	Prenatal exposure to bisphenol A impacts midbrain dopamine neurons and hippocampal spine synapses in non-human primates. Prevalent use of bisphenol-A (BPA) in the manufacture of resins, plastics and paper products has led to frequent exposure of most people to this endocrine disruptor. Some rodent studies have suggested that BPA can exert detrimental effects on brain development. However as rodent models cannot be relied on to predict consequences of human exposure to BPA during development, it is important to investigate the effects of BPA on non-human primate brain development. Previous research suggests that BPA preferentially targets dopamine neurons in ventral mesencephalon and glutamatergic neurons in hippocampus, so the present work examined the susceptibility of these systems to low dose BPA exposure at the fetal and juvenile stages of development in non-human primates. Exposure of pregnant rhesus monkeys to relatively low levels of BPA during the final 2 months of gestation, induced abnormalities in fetal ventral mesencephalon and hippocampus. Specifically, light microscopy revealed a decrease in tyrosine hydroxylase-expressing (dopamine) neurons in the midbrain of BPA-exposed fetuses and electron microscopy identified a reduction in spine synapses in the CA1 region of hippocampus. In contrast, administration of BPA to juvenile vervet monkeys (14-18 months of age) was without effect on these indices, or on dopamine and serotonin concentrations in striatum and prefrontal cortex, or on performance of a cognitive task that tests working memory capacity. These data indicate that BPA exerts an age-dependent detrimental impact on primate brain development, at blood levels within the range measured in humans having only environmental contact with BPA.
23071106	Potentiation of CHEMICALNOTIN action by an GENENOTIN-selective CHEMICALNOTIN analog in INS-1 cells: comparison of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and a potential role for GENENOTIN activation of a 2-APB-sensitive Ca2+ influx. CHEMICALIN and gliclazide block the GENEIN GENEIN/GENEIN, causing membrane depolarization and stimulating GENEIN secretion in pancreatic beta cells. We examined the ability of the GENEIN-selective CHEMICALIN analog CHEMICALIN to potentiate the action of these drugs and the mechanism that might account for it. GENEIN secretion stimulated by both 200 Î¼M CHEMICALIN and 20 Î¼M CHEMICALIN, concentrations that had equivalent effects on membrane potential, was inhibited by CHEMICALIN (1 Î¼M) or the GENEIN blocker CHEMICALIN (2 Î¼M) and was potentiated by CHEMICALIN at concentrations â¥2 Î¼M in INS-1 cells. CHEMICALNOTIN transients stimulated by either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN were inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN and were significantly potentiated by 8-pCPT-2'-O-Me-cAMP-AM at 5 Î¼M but not 1 Î¼M. Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN stimulated GENEIN activity; however, only CHEMICALIN did so independently of its activity at GENEIN, and this activity was partially inhibited by GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN alone (5 Î¼M) did not stimulate GENEIN secretion, but did increase intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentration significantly, and this activity was inhibited by 25 Î¼M CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) or the removal of extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN potentiation of GENEIN secretion stimulated by CHEMICALIN was markedly inhibited by CHEMICALIN (25 Î¼M) and enhanced by the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (1 Î¼M). Our data demonstrate that the actions of both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are strongly potentiated by CHEMICALNOTIN, that CHEMICALIN can stimulate GENEIN activity via a partially GENENOTIN-sensitive mechanism, and that CHEMICALNOTIN potentiation of tolbutamide action may involve activation of a CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN influx.
22972179	Energy depletion of bovine mammary epithelial cells activates GENENOTIN and suppresses protein synthesis through inhibition of GENENOTIN signaling. The molecular mechanisms by which cellular energy status regulates global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells have not been characterized. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation by CHEMICALNOTIN on protein synthesis and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) signaling pathway in bovine mammary epithelial cells. Phosphorylation of GENEIN at CHEMICALIN172 increased by 1.4-fold within 5 min, and remained elevated throughout a 30-min time course, in response to CHEMICALIN. Global rates of protein synthesis declined by 78% of control values. The decline in protein synthesis was associated with repression of GENENOTIN signaling, as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Phosphorylation of ER-stress marker GENEIN was also increased but only at 30 min of CHEMICALIN exposure. CHEMICALIN increased phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN) on GENEIN consensus sites but did not change the amount of GENEIN bound to GENEIN. Activation of GENENOTIN did not result in changes in the amount of raptor bound to GENENOTIN. The inhibitory effects of GENENOTIN activation on GENENOTIN signaling were associated with a marked increase in CHEMICALNOTIN792 phosphorylation on raptor. Collectively, the results suggest that activation of GENENOTIN represses global protein synthesis in mammary epithelial cells through inhibition of GENENOTIN signaling.
17919259	CHEMICALIN: a dual GENEIN antagonist [corrected]. Several fluid retentive states such as heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver, and syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion are associated with inappropriate elevation in plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a neuropeptide that is secreted by the hypothalamus and plays a critical role in the regulation of serum osmolality and in circulatory homeostasis. The actions of CHEMICALNOTIN are mediated by three receptor subtypes V1a, V2, and V1b. The GENENOTIN regulates vasodilation and cellular hypertrophy while the GENENOTIN regulates free water excretion. The GENENOTIN regulates GENENOTIN release. CHEMICALIN is a nonpeptide dual GENEIN antagonist. It binds with high affinity, competitively, and reversibly to the GENENOTIN subtypes; its antagonistic effect is concentration dependent. It inhibits GENENOTIN liver enzyme and elevates plasma levels of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. It is approved only for short-term intravenous use. Infusion site reaction is the most common reason for discontinuation of the drug. In animals conivaptan increased urine volume and free water clearance. In heart failure models it improved hemodynamic parameters and free water excretion. CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to correct hyponatremia in euvolemic or hypervolemic patients. Its efficacy and safety for short-term use have led to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of its intravenous form for the correction of hyponatremia in euvolemic and hypervolemic states. Despite its ability to block the action of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN, no demonstrable benefit from this action was noted in patients with chronic compensated heart failure and it is not approved for this indication. Consideration should be given to further evaluation of its potential benefits in patients with acute decompensated heart failure.
1977506	CHEMICALIN and asthma: an appraisal based on specific GENEIN antagonism. GENEIN antagonists have been utilized, following their initial chemical synthesis in 1933, both in the treatment of conditions in which CHEMICALIN is considered to be of pathogenic importance and conversely to help elucidate the role of CHEMICALIN in disease, through an evaluation of their influence on disease expression. While there is considerable indirect evidence to implicate CHEMICALIN in the pathogenesis of asthma, a critical evaluation of GENEIN antagonism in this condition has, until recently, proved difficult, as many of the early GENEIN antagonists possessed additional actions, such as anti-cholinergic, local anaesthetic, GENENOTIN antagonistic and anti-serotonin activity. In addition, GENENOTIN antagonists have been shown to have effects on mast cell function. In low concentrations in vitro, antihistamines have been found to inhibit immunologically stimulated mast cell mediator release, with the IC50 in the nanomolar to micromolar range, while at higher concentrations they induce CHEMICALNOTIN release. The potency of these drugs in producing such effects is unrelated to their GENENOTIN blocking activity. Furthermore the sedative effects of these therapeutic agents limit the tolerable administrable dose and thus the degree of GENENOTIN blockade achievable within the airways. The recent development of GENEIN antagonists devoid of clinical sedative effects has enabled the administration of doses of GENENOTIN-antihistamines which achieve a greater degree of GENEIN blockade within the airways, thus permitting a better appraisal of the role of CHEMICALIN in this condition. Furthermore, the receptor specificity of many of these agents has been focused such that CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are devoid of anticholinergic activity and exhibit little alpha-antagonistic or anti-CHEMICALNOTIN activity of clinical relevance. However, of these agents both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN possess additional actions likely to be of relevance to asthma. Pretreatment with CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to reduce the recovery of both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in nasal lavage fluid following nasal allergen challenge, a finding interpreted as indicative of in vivo mast cell stabilization, and CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown in vivo at therapeutic doses to inhibit allergen-induced eosinophil chemotaxis. Thus while both these agents offer the potential of an oral therapy for asthma based on an GENENOTIN antagonist, their additional actions do not make them ideally suited to the exploration of the role of CHEMICALNOTIN in asthma.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
23567961	Identification of novel FLT3 kinase inhibitors. FLT3 and PDGFR tyrosine kinases are important targets for therapy of different types of leukemia. Several FLT3/PDGFR inhibitors are currently under clinical investigation for combination with standard therapy for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), however these agents only induce partial remission and development of resistance has been reported. In this work we describe the identification of potent and novel dual FLT3/PDGFR inhibitors that resulted from our efforts to screen a library of 25,607 small molecules against the FLT3 dependent cell line MOLM-13 and the PDGFR dependent cell line EOL-1. This effort led to the identification of five compounds that were confirmed to be active on additional FLT3 dependent cell lines (cellular EC50 values between 35 and 700Â nM), while having no significant effect on 24 other tyrosine kinases.
23639738	Enzyme-responsive surface erosion of CHEMICALNOTIN for controlled drug release. GENEIN (GENEIN) induced surface erosion of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and drug release from CHEMICALNOTIN under mild physiological environment was investigated. The degradation process was monitored by changes of mass and molecular weight (MW) and surface morphology of polymer films. During the whole period of degradation, MW of CHEMICALNOTIN was unchanged. Water uptake of the polymer was only 2.8 and 0.2% for CHEMICALNOTIN with the MW of 200 kDa (CHEMICALNOTIN200) and CHEMICALNOTIN with the MW of 41 kDa (CHEMICALNOTIN41), respectively. Degradation of less hydrophilic CHEMICALNOTIN41 with higher density was slower than that of CHEMICALNOTIN200. By this mechanism, GENENOTIN-responsive drug in vitro release from CHEMICALNOTIN in situ forming depots (ISFD) was conducted successfully. As expected, less GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was released from CHEMICALNOTIN41 compared with that of CHEMICALNOTIN200 in the same time period. In conclusion, this work enabled the in vitro drug release evaluation of existing CHEMICALNOTIN devices and implied a new candidate for the development of enzyme-responsive systems.
23410126	Genome-wide integrated analyses of androgen receptor signaling in prostate cancer based on high-throughput technology. The androgen receptor (AR) is a steroid hormone receptor that functions as a ligand-dependent transcriptional factor, which plays a key role in the development and progression of prostate cancer. Recent advancement in high throughput technologies including microarrays and deep-sequencing provides unbiased genome-wide knowledge on the AR signaling including datasets for androgen-regulated gene expression and genomic binding sites for AR. In the present review, we will briefly summarize the main features of the AR signaling as well as the individual AR target genes identified by the integration of multiple datasets in prostate cancer. Cap analysis gene expression (CAGE) is also featured as a unique transcriptome method, which particularly determines the androgen-dependent transcription start points in prostate cancer.
17479245	GENENOTIN antagonism improves islet function in mice with GENENOTIN resistance induced by a high-fat diet. AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased GENENOTIN secretion predicts deterioration of CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance, and high GENENOTIN levels contribute to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of glucagon action may therefore be a potential novel target to reduce hyperglycaemia. Here, we investigated whether chronic treatment with a GENENOTIN antagonist (GRA) improves islet dysfunction in female mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of HFD, mice were treated with a small molecule GRA (300 mg/kg, gavage once daily) for up to 30 days. GENENOTIN secretion was studied after oral and intravenous administration of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN secretion after intravenous CHEMICALNOTIN. Islet morphology was examined and GENENOTIN secretion and CHEMICALNOTIN oxidation were measured in isolated islets. RESULTS: Fasting plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels were reduced by GRA (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.017). The acute GENEIN response to intravenous CHEMICALIN was augmented (1,300 +/- 110 vs 790 +/- 64 pmol/l; p < 0.001). The early GENEIN response to oral CHEMICALIN was reduced in mice on HFD + GRA (1,890 +/- 160 vs 3,040 +/- 420 pmol/l; p = 0.012), but CHEMICALNOTIN excursions were improved. Intravenous CHEMICALIN significantly increased the acute GENEIN response (129 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 6 ng/l in controls; p < 0.01), notably without affecting plasma CHEMICALNOTIN. GRA caused a modest increase in alpha cell mass, while beta cell mass was similar to that in mice on HFD + vehicle. Isolated islets displayed improved CHEMICALIN-stimulated GENEIN secretion after GRA treatment (0.061 +/- 0.007 vs 0.030 +/- 0.004 pmol islet(-1) h(-1) at 16.7 mmol/l CHEMICALNOTIN; p < 0.001), without affecting islet CHEMICALNOTIN oxidation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic GENENOTIN antagonism in HFD-fed mice improves islet sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN and increases GENENOTIN secretion, suggesting improvement of key defects underlying impaired CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance and type 2 diabetes.
23552101	Cis-silencing of GENENOTIN evidenced in Friedreich's ataxia patient cells results in cytoskeleton anomalies. Friedreich's ataxia (FRDA) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by ataxia, variously associating heart disease, diabetes mellitus and/or CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance. It results from intronic expansion of GENENOTIN at the GENENOTIN locus. Homozygous expansions cause silencing of the GENENOTIN gene and subsequent decreased expression of the encoded mitochondrial GENENOTIN. Detailed analyses in fibroblasts and neuronal tissues from FRDA patients have revealed profound cytoskeleton anomalies. So far, however, the molecular mechanism underlying these cytoskeleton defects remains unknown. We show here that gene silencing spreads in cis over the GENENOTIN gene in cells from FRDA patients (circulating lymphocytes and primary fibroblasts), correlating with expanded GAA repeat size. GENEIN encodes GENEIN (GENEIN), an enzyme functionally linked to GENENOTIN cytoskeleton dynamics that phosphorylates CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN] to generate CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN]. Accordingly, loss of GENEIN function in FRDA cells was accompanied by decreased CHEMICALIN levels and was shown instrumental for destabilization of the actin network and delayed cell spreading. Knockdown of GENENOTIN in control fibroblasts using shRNA reproduced abnormal GENENOTIN cytoskeleton remodeling, whereas over-expression of GENENOTIN, but not GENENOTIN, suppressed this phenotype in FRDA cells. In addition to provide new insights into the consequences of the GENENOTIN gene expansion, these findings raise the question whether GENENOTIN silencing may contribute to the variable manifestation of this complex disease.
23453039	Involvement of GENENOTIN in lipid metabolism and diabetes. GENEIN (GENEIN/GENEIN) was originally discovered in 1978 as a unique CHEMICALIN-binding protein that does not contain the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN gene (GENENOTIN) is localized on the X chromosome and is identified in over 15 species consisting the GENENOTIN family. GENENOTIN has been shown to play a multifunctional role in cell regulation; maintaining of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis and suppressing of signal transduction, translational protein synthesis, nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) synthesis, proliferation, and apoptosis in many cell types. Moreover, GENENOTIN may play a pathophysiological role in metabolic disorder. The expression of GENEIN is stimulated through the action of GENENOTIN in liver cells in vitro and in vivo and it is decreased in the liver of rats with type I diabetes induced by CHEMICALIN administration in vivo. Overexpression of endogenous GENENOTIN stimulates CHEMICALNOTIN utilization and lipid production in liver cells with CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation in vitro. GENENOTIN reveals GENENOTIN resistance in liver cells. Deficiency of GENENOTIN induces an impairment of CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance and lipid accumulation in the liver of mice in vivo. Overexpression of endogenous GENENOTIN has been shown to decrease CHEMICALNOTIN, total CHEMICALNOTIN and glycogen contents in the liver of rats, inducing hyperlipidemia. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA expressions in the liver tissues are decreased in GENENOTIN transgenic rats. Decrease in hepatic GENENOTIN is associated with the development and progression of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and fibrosis in human patients. Regucalcin may be a key molecule in lipid metabolic disorder and diabetes.
19428322	GENENOTIN-dependent and -independent mechanisms underlying in vitro antiglioma action of compound C. We investigated the effect of compound C, a well-known inhibitor of the intracellular energy sensor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), on proliferation and viability of human U251 and rat C6 glioma cell lines. Compound C caused G(2)/M cell cycle block, accompanied by apoptotic glioma cell death characterized by GENENOTIN activation, CHEMICALNOTIN exposure and DNA fragmentation. The mechanisms underlying the pro-apoptotic action of compound C involved induction of oxidative stress and downregulation of antiapoptotic molecule GENENOTIN, while no alteration of pro-apoptotic GENENOTIN was observed. Compound C diminished GENENOTIN phosphorylation and enzymatic activity, resulting in reduced phosphorylation of its target GENENOTIN. GENEIN activators CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN partly prevented the cell cycle block, oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by compound C. The small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting of GENENOTIN mimicked compound C-induced G(2)/M cell cycle arrest, but failed to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis in U251 glioma cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that GENENOTIN inhibition is required, but not sufficient for compound C-mediated apoptotic death of glioma cells.
15082029	Evidence that the granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) receptor plays a role in the pharmacokinetics of G-CSF and PegG-CSF using a G-CSF-R KO model. The covalent attachment of polyethylene glycol to filgrastim results in a new molecule pegfilgrastim, which has a significantly longer half-life than filgrastim. It is likely that the clearance of both filgrastim and pegfilgrastim involves granulocyte colony simulating factor (G-CSF) receptor binding, but the pharmacokinetics of these drugs have not been compared in mice with and without a functional G-CSF receptor. We sought to clarify the role of receptor-mediated clearance of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim using wild-type (WT) mice or mice with a non-functional G-CSF-R (knockout, KO). We administered single doses of filgrastim or pegfilgrastim (10 or 100 microg kg(-1)) intravenously to WT and KO mice. Plasma levels of protein were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) at preset time points, and AUC, MRT, CL, V(d), and T(1/2) were calculated. When compared with WT mice, the G-CSF-R KO mice had significantly greater AUC, longer MRT, longer T(1/2), and lower clearance. This was the case whether animals received 10 or 100 microg kg(-1) and whether they received filgrastim or pegfilgrastim. The volume of protein distribution was identical among WT and KO mice. However, the V(d) was larger after pegfilgrastim dosing than after filgrastim dosing. In both WT and KO mice, increasing the dose of figrastim or pegfilgrastim resulted in a proportional increase in the AUC. A functional G-CSF-R is an important mechanism in the plasma clearance of both filgrastim and pegfilgrastim.
16199241	Duloxetine hydrochloride: a new dual-acting medication for the treatment of major depressive disorder. BACKGROUND: Duloxetine hydrochloride has recently been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Duloxetine is a potent inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake, with weak effects on dopamine reuptake. OBJECTIVE: This article reviews the literature on duloxetine with regard to its pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, and tolerability. METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE was performed using the terms duloxetine, Cymbalta, and major depressive disorder, with no restriction on year. The Eli Lilly and Company clinical trial registry, and abstracts and posters from recent American Psychiatric Association meetings were also reviewed. RESULTS: Duloxetine exhibits linear, dose-dependent pharmacokinetics across the approved oral dosage range of 40 to 60 mg/d. No dose adjustment appears to be needed based on age. Duloxetine has shown efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo, and duloxetine recipients have shown significant improvements in global functioning compared with placebo (both, P < 0.05). Response and remission rates have been comparable to or greater than those seen with fluoxetine or paroxetine. Duloxetine is generally well tolerated, with nausea, dry mouth, and fatigue being the most common treatment-emergent adverse effects. Cardiovascular adverse effects do not appear to result in sustained blood pressure elevations, QTc-interval prolongation, or other electrocardiographic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the available evidence, duloxetine is a well-tolerated and effective treatment for MDD in adults. Randomized head-to-head comparisons against established antidepressants are needed to determine the relative safety and efficacy of duloxetine.
17391279	In vivo effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant defence systems. Comparison with non-selective and GENENOTIN selective NSAIDs. 1. The in vivo effects of the non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) CHEMICALNOTIN, a pro-drug of the NSAID CHEMICALNOTIN, on lipid peroxidation, CHEMICALNOTIN levels and activity of antioxidant enzymes (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) in rat gastric mucosa, colon mucosa and liver, were compared with the effects of non-selective (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENEIN selective (CHEMICALIN) NSAIDs. 2. CHEMICALIN treatment led to an increase in lipid peroxidation, GENEIN and GENEIN activities and to a decrease in GENEIN activity and CHEMICALNOTIN levels in gastric mucosa. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN treatment was without effects in gastric and colon mucosa, or liver from control animals. Like CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN had no effect on the lipid peroxidation, or on enzyme and non-enzyme antioxidant defence systems in gastric mucosa. 3. It is suggested that the lack of pro-oxidant effects in vivo associated with CHEMICALNOTIN treatment contribute improved gastric tolerability.
23386702	Reversible inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. GENEIN hydrolyze CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN to produce CHEMICALIN and resulting CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, respectively. GENEIN are colocalized with GENEIN and have the potential to further metabolize CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN, but it is currently unknown if CHEMICALIN, being CHEMICALNOTIN, also interact with GENENOTIN. Objective: This study explores the ability of CHEMICALIN to act as substrates or inhibitors of GENEIN (GENEIN) and 2 (GENEIN). Methods: The stability of six CHEMICALIN in the presence of GENEIN, GENEIN, and buffer alone (100 mM CHEMICALNOTIN, pH 7.4, 37Â°C) were investigated. Reversible inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis by the CHEMICALNOTIN was also studied. CHEMICALNOTIN was used to explore potential time-dependent inactivation. Results: The chemical stability half-life values for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN were found to be 0.252, 0.537, 0.996, 1.77, 3.67, 5.02, and 15.2 hours, respectively. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN selectively inhibited GENEIN, with Ki values of 4.32 Â± 0.47, 24.8 Â± 4.2, 355 Â± 38, 468 Â± 21, 707 Â± 64 ÂµM, respectively, but did not significantly inhibit GENEIN. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN did not inhibit either GENEIN. Time-dependent inactivation of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN was not observed. Lastly, both GENEIN and GENEIN were shown not to catalyze the hydrolysis of the CHEMICALIN studied. Conclusion: Drug-drug interaction studies may be warranted for drugs that metabolize to CHEMICALIN due to the potential inhibition of GENEIN.
23274771	GENEIN-associated mechanisms underlying the response of embryonic cells to CHEMICALIN. The involvement of GENENOTIN in the regulation of teratogen-induced apoptosis has not been established yet. Therefore, we tried to assess the involvement of the GENENOTIN subunit of GENENOTIN in the embryonic response to the anti-cancer drug CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). Thus, exposure of GENENOTIN knockout (GENENOTIN(-/-)) or wild type (WT) mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to CHEMICALNOTIN resulted in a decrease in cell survival, culture density and cell proliferation, which was found to be more prominent in GENENOTIN(-/-) MEFs. Those phenomena were accompanied by a CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increase in the proportion of apoptotic cells, which was demonstrated only in GENENOTIN(-/-) cells and a G2/M arrest, which was found to be more prominent in WT cells. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN-treated WT and GENENOTIN(-/-) MEFs differed in their expression of various apoptosis-associated molecules, when the former demonstrated a decrease in the percentage of GENEIN-positive and a more prominent decrease in the percentage of GENENOTIN-positive cells, while a decreased percentage of GENENOTIN-positive and a more prominent decrease in the percentage of GENENOTIN-positive cells was detected among the latter. The fact that the response of the cells to the teratogen was clearly GENENOTIN-dependent implicates this molecule to be involved in the response of the embryonic cells to CHEMICALNOTIN.
23523949	Protective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN induced cardiotoxicity in rats in subchronic exposure. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of CHEMICALNOTIN, main component of Crocus sativus L. (Saffron) against subchronic CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) induced cardiotoxicity in rats. METHODS: Rats were divided into 7 groups; control (corn oil, gavage), DZN (15mg/kg/day, gavage,), CHEMICALNOTIN (12.5, 25 or 50mg/kg/day, i.p) plus CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (200IU/kg, i.p, three times per week) plus CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (50mg/kg/day, i.p) groups. Treatments were continued for 4weeks. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels were evaluated in heart tissue at the end of treatments. Levels of apoptotic proteins (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN were analyzed by Western blotting. Transcript levels of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were also determined using qRT PCR. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN induced histophatological damages and elevated the level of cardiac marker GENEIN. These effects were associated with increased CHEMICALNOTIN level, lower level of reduced CHEMICALNOTIN and induction of apoptosis through elevation of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ratio (both protein and mRNA levels), GENENOTIN release to the cytosol and activation GENENOTIN in cardiac tissue. CHEMICALIN (25 and 50mg/kg) or CHEMICALIN improved histopathological damages, decreased CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN, increased CHEMICALNOTIN content and attenuated the increase of GENEIN/GENEIN ratio, activation of GENEIN and release of GENEIN to the cytosol induced by CHEMICALIN. In summary, CHEMICALNOTIN induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis in heart tissue of rat following subchronic exposure. CHEMICALNOTIN, as an antioxidant, showed protective effects against CHEMICALNOTIN cardiotoxicity by reducing lipid peroxidation and alleviating apoptosis.
23601399	Nutrients and bioactive compounds of Thai indigenous fruits. This study determined the nutritional potential of Thai indigenous fruits in terms of nutrients, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activities. Three indigenous fruits were collected at two conservation areas in Kanchanaburi province, Thailand. The results showed that Phyllanthus emblica L. exhibited the highest levels of vitamin C (575Â±452mg/100g), total phenolics (TP) (3703Â±1244mGAE/100g), and antioxidant activities, as measured by DPPH, FRAP and ORAC assays. Compared to the other two fruits, Antidesma velutinosum Blume contained higher levels of most nutrients and dietary fibre (15.6Â±5.9g/100g), as well as carotenoids (335Â±98Î¼g/100g) and phytosterols (22.1Â±3.9mg/100g). Spondias pinnata (L.f.) Kurz was high in total phenolics (3178Â±887mGAE/100g) and antioxidant activity. Moreover, high correlations were found between TP and antioxidant activities (r>0.9). These Thai indigenous fruits are potentially good sources of nutrients, bioactive compounds, and antioxidant activities. Conservation and utilisation should be promoted for food security and consumption as part of a healthy diet.
23415228	A genetic program promotes C. elegans longevity at cold temperatures via a thermosensitive GENENOTIN. Both poikilotherms and homeotherms live longer at lower body temperatures, highlighting a general role of temperature reduction in lifespan extension. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. One prominent model is that cold temperatures reduce the rate of chemical reactions, thereby slowing the rate of aging. This view suggests that cold-dependent lifespan extension is simply a passive thermodynamic process. Here, we challenge this view in C. elegans by showing that genetic programs actively promote longevity at cold temperatures. We find that GENENOTIN, a cold-sensitive GENENOTIN, detects temperature drop in the environment to extend lifespan. This effect requires cold-induced, GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN influx and a CHEMICALIN-sensitive GENEIN that signals to the transcription factor GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN can functionally substitute for GENENOTIN in promoting longevity. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized function for GENENOTIN, link CHEMICALNOTIN signaling to longevity, and, importantly, demonstrate that genetic programs contribute to lifespan extension at cold temperatures.
11730729	Effect of CHEMICALIN-induced constitutive GENEIN activity on contractile receptor function in airway smooth muscle. In the present study, we investigated the effect of CHEMICALIN-induced constitutive GENEIN activity on GENENOTIN agonist- and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced bovine tracheal smooth muscle contractions. Bovine tracheal smooth muscle strips were incubated with 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN or vehicle for various periods of time (5, 30 min, 18 h) at 37 degrees C. After extensive washout (3 h, 37 degrees C), isometric contractions were measured to the full GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN, the partial GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN treatment significantly reduced the sensitivity (pEC(50)) to CHEMICALNOTIN in a time-dependent manner, without affecting maximal contraction (E(max)). CHEMICALNOTIN treatment similarly reduced the pEC(50) of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN; however, E(max) values were also reduced, to approximately 70% of control after 18-h treatment. The inverse agonist CHEMICALNOTIN, having no effect on control preparations, consistently restored the reduced pEC(50) and E(max) values of the contractile agonists. Remarkably, in the presence of timolol the pEC(50) values of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated airways were significantly enhanced compared to controls. In conclusion, CHEMICALIN-induced constitutive GENEIN activity reduces GENENOTIN agonist- and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contractions of bovine tracheal smooth muscle, which can be reversed by the inverse agonist CHEMICALIN. Moreover, after GENENOTIN agonist treatment, inverse agonism by GENENOTIN antagonists may cause enhanced airway reactivity to contractile mediators.
23247009	CHEMICALIN reduces the expression of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory markers by inhibition of GENEIN in murine macrophages and ocular tissues. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyzes the reduction of toxic lipid CHEMICALIN to their CHEMICALIN products and mediates inflammatory signals triggered by lipopolysaccharide (LPS). CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a recently described GENEIN inhibitor, was purified from extracts of the Indian gooseberry (Emblica officinalis). In this study, we found that CHEMICALIN showed low cytotoxicity in Raw264.7 murine macrophages and effectively inhibited GENEIN activity as measured by a decrease in CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation. In addition, CHEMICALIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN prevented LPS-induced activation of GENEIN and GENEIN and lowered ROS levels, which could inhibit LPS-induced apoptosis. Uveitis is a disease of the eye associated with chronic inflammation. In this study, we also demonstrated that treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN decreased the number of inflammatory cells that infiltrate the ocular media of mice with experimental uveitis. Accordingly, these results suggest CHEMICALNOTIN is a potential therapy for inflammatory diseases.
23459167	Differential phosphoproteome of the striatum from GENENOTIN knockout and GENENOTIN knockout mice treated with CHEMICALNOTIN: Correlations with CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxicity. The neurotrophic factors GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) have been shown to modulate CHEMICALIN-induced neurotoxicity. Accordingly, GENENOTIN-/- and GENENOTIN-/- mice show an increased vulnerability to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxic effects. In an effort to uncover new pharmacological targets to prevent CHEMICALNOTIN neurotoxic effects, we have now used a proteomic approach to study protein phosphorylation, in which we combined phosphoprotein enrichment, by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC), with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, in order to identify the phosphoproteins regulated in the striatum of GENENOTIN-/-, GENENOTIN-/- and wild type (WT) mice treated with CHEMICALNOTIN. We identified 13 differentially expressed phosphoproteins that are judged to be relevant in the neuroprotective roles of GENEIN and GENEIN against CHEMICALIN-induced neurotoxicity. It is very interesting to note that 4 of these phosphoproteins, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), are known to be involved in Parkinson's disease, a result of significant importance since GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN have been also demonstrated to limit Parkinson's disease (PD) progress and have been suggested to be among the important genetic factors possibly preventing the development of PD in CHEMICALNOTIN abusers. The data identify phosphoproteins differentially regulated by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment and/or the presence of endogenous GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN which may be relevant mediators of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN neuroprotective effects against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxicity. The data support further studies to validate the phosphoproteins here identified as possible new pharmacological targets to prevent CHEMICALNOTIN neurotoxic effects.
23530006	Universal rule on chirality-dependent bandgaps in graphene antidot lattices. Graphene with periodically patterned antidots has attracted intense research attention as it represents a facile route to open a bandgap for graphene electronics. However, not all graphene antidot lattices (GALs) can open a bandgap and a guiding rule is missing. Here, through systematic first-principles calculations, it is found that bandgaps in triangular GALs are surprisingly well defined by a chirality vector R = n a1 + ma2 connecting two neighboring antidots, where a1 and a2 are the basis vectors of graphene. The bandgap opens in the GALs with (n-m)mod3 = 0 but remains closed in those with (n-m)mod3 = Â±1, reminiscent of the gap-chirality rule in carbon nanotubes. Remarkably, the gap value in GALs allows ample modulation by adjusting the length of chirality vectors, shape and size of the antidots. The gap-chirality relation in GALs stems from the chirality-dependent atomic structures of GALs as revealed by a super-atom model as well as Clar sextet analyses. This chirality-dependent bandgap is further shown to be a generic behavior in any parallelogram GAL and thus serves as an essential stepping stone for experimenters to realize graphene devices by antidot engineering.
9480923	Exogenous CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN via GENEIN-dependent signalling pathway. CHEMICALNOTIN is an important regulatory molecule implicated in a variety of biological processes in response to stress and GENENOTIN. To understand the signal transduction pathway of CHEMICALNOTIN to the nucleus, in the present study, we examined whether CHEMICALNOTIN, a cell permeable CHEMICALNOTIN, activates GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Treatment of Rat-2 fibroblast cells with CHEMICALIN caused the stimulation of GENEIN-dependent reporter gene activity in a dose- and time-dependent manner by transient transfection analysis. Next, we examined the role of GENENOTIN family GENENOTIN in the CHEMICALIN-induced signalling to GENEIN activation. By reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN activation was shown to be selectively repressed by pEXV-RacN17 encoding a dominant negative mutant of GENENOTIN, suggesting that GENEIN activity is essential for the signalling cascade of CHEMICALIN to the nucleus. In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of GENENOTIN in the CHEMICALNOTIN-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with CHEMICALNOTIN, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) oligonucleotide repressed the CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN activation selectively, implying a critical role of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN-induced signalling to nucleus. Consistent with these results, the translocation of GENEIN protein as well as the release of CHEMICALIN, a principal product of GENEIN, was rapidly induced by the addition of CHEMICALIN in a GENEIN-dependent manner. Together, our findings suggest the critical role of 'GENEIN and subsequent activation of GENEIN' in CHEMICALIN-signalling to nucleus.
16730121	Effect of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a selective GENEIN agonist, on motor performance in mice. Effect of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), a selective GENEIN agonist, on motor coordination was studied using rota-rod performance in mice. CHEMICALNOTIN did not impair rota-rod performance at doses of 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg, p.o. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a ligand of GENEIN biding site, also had no impairment on the performance, per se. However, in combination with a low dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (3mg/kg, p.o.), treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN exacerbated the impairment by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN had no significant effect on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced impairment of motor coordination.
23514378	The role of platelet/lymphocyte GENENOTIN in depression and beyond. A large amount of the data gathered in the last 50 years support the hypothesis that alterations of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) neurotransmission play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of not only major depression (MD), but also of different neuropsychiatric disorders. Research in this field has been substantially promoted by the evidence that the reuptake protein (GENENOTIN), present in presynaptic neurons, is a key element in terminating the activity of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. For this reason, it was specifically targeted for the development of second-generation antidepressants, in particular of selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), with the aim of increasing the intrasynaptic CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations. Moreover, since a lot of studies showed that circulating platelets and, more recently, lymphocytes possess functional GENENOTIN proteins, they have been widely used as peripheral mirrors of the same structures located in the central nervous system. The presence of functional GENENOTIN in blood cells suggests strict relationships between the nervous and the immune system that need to be better clarified in MD, as well as the possibility of reciprocal modulation of the two systems by different drugs. This paper aims to review briefly the literature on the CHEMICALIN hypothesis of depression with a major focus on the possible role of GENEIN in this disorder, while highlighting how recent data are more oriented on dimensional rather than nosological involvement of this structure in different conditions spanning from normality to pathology.
23410005	Synthesis and cancer stem cell-based activity of substituted CHEMICALIN designed as next generation GENEIN inhibitors. Dysregulation of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathway in a wide range of tumors has made GENENOTIN a consensus target to inhibit as illustrated by more than 15 inhibitors now in clinical trials. Our previous work, built on the early pioneering multikinase inhibitor CHEMICALIN, resulted in the only GENEIN vascular-targeted GENEIN inhibitor prodrug, CHEMICALIN, which has now completed Phase I clinical trials. This inhibitor has properties that impart more in vivo activity than should be warranted by its enzymatic potency, which in general is much lower than other clinical stage GENENOTIN inhibitors. We embarked on the exploration of scaffolds that retained such properties while simultaneously exhibiting an increased potency toward GENENOTIN. This work resulted in the discovery of the CHEMICALIN system as the foundation of a new compound class of potential GENEIN inhibitors having improved potency toward GENEIN. The synthesis and cancer stem cell-based activity of these compounds are reported herein.
23265893	Heterobivalent dual-target probe for targeting GRP and Y1 receptors on tumor cells. Receptor targeting ligands for imaging and/or therapy of cancer are limited by heterogeneity of receptor expression by tumor cells, both inter-patient and intra-patient. It is often more important for imaging agents to identify local and distant spread of disease than it is to identify a specific receptor presence. Two natural hormone peptide receptors, GRPR and Y1, are specifically interesting because expression of GRPR, Y1 or both is up-regulated in most breast cancers. We describe here the design and development of a new heterobivalent peptide ligand, truncated bombesin (t-BBN)/BVD15-DO3A, for dual-targeting of GRPR and Y1, and validation of its dual binding capability. Such a probe should be useful in imaging cells, tissues and tumors that are GRPR and/or Y1 positive and should target radioisotopes, for example, (68)Ga and/or (177)Lu, to more tumors cells than single GRPR or Y1 targeted probes. A GRP targeting ligand, J-G-Abz4-QWAVGHLM-NH(2) (J-G-Abz4-t-BBN), and an Y1 targeting ligand, INP-K[Îµ-J-(Î±-DO3A-Îµ-DGa)-K]-YRLRY-NH(2)([Îµ-J-(Î±-DO3A-Îµ-DGa)-K]-BVD-15), were synthesized and coupled to produce the heterobivalent ligand, t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A. Competitive displacement binding assays using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against (125)I-Tyr(4)-BBN yielded an IC(50) value of 18 Â± 0.7 nM for GRPR in T-47D cells, a human breast cancer cell line. A similar assay using t-BBN/BVD15-DO3A against porcine (125)I-NPY showed IC(50) values of 80 Â± 11 nM for Y1 receptor in MCF7 cells, another human breast cancer cell line. In conclusion, it is possible to construct a single DO3A chelate containing probe that can target both GRPR and Y1 on human tumor cells.
23584857	Induction of the metabolic regulator Txnip in fasting-induced and natural torpor. Torpor is a physiological state characterised by controlled lowering of metabolic rate and core body temperature, allowing substantial energy savings during periods of reduced food availability or harsh environmental conditions. The hypothalamus coordinates energy homeostasis and thermoregulation, and plays a key role in directing torpor. We recently showed that mice lacking the orphan G protein coupled receptor Gpr50 readily enter torpor in response to fasting, and have now used these mice to conduct a microarray analysis of hypothalamic gene expression changes related to the torpor state. This revealed a strong induction of thioredoxin interacting protein (Txnip) in the hypothalamus of torpid mice, which was confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses. In situ hybridisation identified the ependyma lining the third ventricle as the principal site of torpor-related expression of Txnip. To characterise further the relationship between Txnip and torpor, we profiled Txnip expression in mice during prolonged fasting, cold exposure, and 2-deoxyglucose-induced hypometabolism, as well as in naturally occurring torpor bouts in the Siberian hamster. Strikingly, pronounced upregulation of Txnip expression was only observed in WT mice when driven into torpor, and during torpor in the Siberian hamster. Increase of Txnip was not limited to the hypothalamus, with exaggerated expression in white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue, and liver also demonstrated in torpid mice. Given the recent identification of Txnip as a molecular nutrient sensor important in the regulation of energy metabolism, our data suggest that elevated Txnip expression is critical to regulating energy expenditure and fuel utilisation during the extreme hypometabolic state of torpor.
23567959	Design, synthesis and antiproliferative properties of some new 5-substituted-2-iminobenzimidazole derivatives. Some new 1,3,5-substituted-2,3-dihydro-2-imino-benzimidazoles were synthesized under solid-liquid phase transfer catalysis conditions using 5-substituted-2-aminobenzimidazoles as precursors in order to assess their cytotoxicity respectively proliferative activity. The structures of the compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. Compounds 9-10, 12 and 16-17 were evaluated for their cytotoxical effect on four cancer cell lines: HT-29, breast cancer cells MDA-MB-231, HeLa, HepG2 and as well as human diploid cell line Lep-3. Significant cytotoxicity of hydrazone 16 against MDA-MB-231 was established by biologically study, the IC50 was 6.2Â nM while the EC50 value to Lep 3 is 0.21Â nM. Relative high antiproliferative effects ofÂ theÂ acetate 12 and compound 16 against HT-29 were ascertained and the calculated IC50 values were IC50 - 0.85Â nM and IC50 - 2.83Â nM respectively. Cytotoxic activity against HeLa and HepG2 cells was demonstrated by hydrazone 17, IC50 was 7.2Â nM and 117Â nM respectively. All tested compounds revealed proliferative activities to human diploid cell line Lep-3. The EC50 values were in the range from 0.05 to 16.91Â nM. The obtained results prove the selective cytotoxicity of the tested compounds and are promising for further evaluation of the investigated compounds inÂ vivo experiments using experimentally induced tumors in laboratory animals.
23266719	Immunomodulatory properties of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy subjects and allergic patients. In the present study, we investigated the immunomodulatory activity of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy donors and mite-allergic subjects. Freshly prepared PBMCs, stimulated or not with Toll-like receptor (TLR)1-9 agonists, a T cell mitogen (phytohemagglutinin A) or mite allergen extract were cultured in the presence or absence of MWCNTs. Secretion of TNF-Î±, IL-2, IL-5, IL-6, IL-12/23p40 or IFN-Î³ was quantified in the culture supernatants by ELISA. Basal secretion of all the cytokines was not altered by MWCNTs in PBMCs from both healthy donors and allergic subjects. In PBMCs from healthy donors, TNF-Î±, IL-6 and IL-12/23p40 secretion in response to the TLR4 agonist, lipopolysaccharide was however increased in a dose-dependent manner by MWCNTs. Significant increases in the release of these cytokines were also observed in PBMCs stimulated with a TLR2 or TLR3 agonist. MWCNTs also increased the release of IL-2 and IFN-Î³ by PBMCs stimulated with a T cell mitogen. In contrast, MWCNTs inhibited allergen-induced IL-5 secretion by PBMCs from mite-allergic subjects. As well, MWCNTs altered the capacity of PBMC-derived monocytes to differentiate into functional dendritic cells. All together, our data suggest that according to its immune cell target, MWCNTs may either promote or suppress immune responses in humans. Further investigations are necessary to fully understand the complexity behind interactions of engineered nanoparticles with the immune system.
23509039	2-aminothiazoles with improved pharmacotherapeutic properties for treatment of prion disease. Recently, we described the aminothiazole lead (4-biphenyl-4-ylthiazol-2-yl)-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-amine (1), which exhibits many desirable properties, including excellent stability in liver microsomes, oral bioavailability of â¼40â%, and high exposure in the brains of mice. Despite its good pharmacokinetic properties, compound 1 exhibited only modest potency in mouse neuroblastoma cells overexpressing the disease-causing prion protein PrP(Sc) . Accordingly, we sought to identify analogues of 1 with improved antiprion potency in ScN2a-cl3 cells while retaining similar or superior properties. Herein we report the discovery of improved lead compounds such as (6-methylpyridin-2-yl)-[4-(4-pyridin-3-yl-phenyl)thiazol-2-yl]amine and cyclopropanecarboxylic acid (4-biphenylthiazol-2-yl)amide, which exhibit brain exposure/EC50 ratios at least tenfold greater than that of compound 1.
16978033	Immunotherapy for De Novo renal transplantation: what's in the pipeline? Immunosuppressive drugs have been traditionally developed to prevent acute rejection and to improve short-term kidney transplant outcomes. There is still a medical need to improve outcomes among subgroups of patients at higher risk for graft loss and to reduce cardiovascular, infectious and malignancy-associated morbidity and mortality, and improve long-term adherence. Several new immunosuppressive agents and formulations are undergoing clinical investigation and are discussed in this review.A modified release CHEMICALNOTIN formulation (MR4) for once-daily administration is undergoing phase III trials. It has been developed to be administered de novo or for maintenance using the same therapeutic target CHEMICALNOTIN trough concentrations as for the original formulation. Belatacept (LEA29Y), a second generation GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN), blocks the interaction between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN costimulatory pathways. In phase II trials, belatacept was as effective as CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) when administered in combination with basiliximab, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and corticosteroids. Currently, belatacept is undergoing phase III trials including one study in recipients of organs from expanded criteria donors. Inhibitors of the GENENOTIN show some selectivity for cells of the lymphoid lineage and have been shown to be effective in late preclinical transplant models. The most frequent adverse effects have been related to nonspecific binding to GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor is currently in phase II clinical trials.CHEMICALIN, is a synthetic CHEMICALIN that targets the critical enzyme of the de novo CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis, GENEIN, and GENEIN has completed phase II trials. CHEMICALNOTIN also shows antiviral activities that have been tested in patients with polyomavirus nephropathy. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a synthetic GENEIN modulator that reduces the recirculation of lymphocytes to blood and peripheral tissues including inflammatory lesions and graft sites is undergoing phase III trials. Although the efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN is similar to CHEMICALNOTIN in patients receiving full doses of CHEMICALNOTIN, safety issues such as a negative chronotropic effect, macular oedema, pulmonary adverse reactions and graft function resulted in premature discontinuation of the development programme for kidney transplantation. Because there was no clear clinical benefit over treatment options, the clinical development programme of CHEMICALNOTIN was discontinued.Finally, a new evolving strategy with powerful induction-induced prolonged T-cell depletion followed by low-dose immunosuppressive monotherapy is showing promising results.
15686475	Effect of GENENOTIN on recombinant GENENOTIN. In this work, we report that the recombinant GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) isoforms, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) (GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN) fusion protein or free truncated GENENOTIN, were activated by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) to an extent of 60%. Both truncated forms of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, were markedly activated by GENENOTIN to an extent of 141 and 85%, respectively, while GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN was not significantly affected. The activation appears to be due to an increase of GENEIN affinity for its cofactor, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). This conclusion is based on the following observations. Firstly, the V(max) of GENEIN was increased when GENENOTIN was present whereas the affinity for the substrate, CHEMICALIN, was not affected. Secondly, the affinity of GENEIN for CHEMICALIN was increased in the presence of GENENOTIN. Thirdly, results from GENENOTIN-agarose affinity column chromatography studies indicated a direct interaction or binding between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Fourthly, GENENOTIN was found to be copurified with GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN by anti-GENENOTIN immunoaffinity column using rat brain extract. Hence, it is proposed that a conformational change is induced when GENENOTIN interacts with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, resulting in an increase of GENEIN affinity for CHEMICALIN and the activation of GENENOTIN. The physiological significance of the interaction between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN is discussed.
17488480	CHEMICALNOTIN acts as a mediator of inflammation in acute pancreatitis: in vitro studies using isolated mouse pancreatic acinar cells. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is synthesized from CHEMICALIN via the action of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). We have earlier shown that CHEMICALNOTIN acts as a mediator of inflammation. However the mechanism remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and the expression of CHEMICALIN synthesizing enzymes, GENEIN and GENEIN, in isolated mouse pancreatic acini. Pancreatic acinar cells from mice were incubated with or without CHEMICALNOTIN (10(-7) M for 30 and 60 min). CHEMICALIN increased the levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN mRNA expression while GENEIN mRNA expression was decreased. In addition, cells pre-treated with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, 3 mM), a GENEIN inhibitor, reduced the formation of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN treated cells, suggesting that GENEIN may be the main enzyme involved in CHEMICALIN formation in mouse acinar cells. Furthermore, GENEIN (GENEIN) concentration in the acini and expression of GENEIN gene (GENEIN, GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN), the primary receptor for CHEMICALNOTIN, are increased in secretagogue CHEMICALIN-treated acinar cells. Inhibition of endogenous production of CHEMICALIN by CHEMICALNOTIN significantly suppressed GENEIN concentration, GENEIN expression and GENEIN expression in the acini. To determine whether CHEMICALNOTIN itself provoked inflammation in acinar cells, the cells were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN donor drug, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), (10, 50 and 100 muM), that resulted in a significant increase in GENEIN concentration and expression of GENEIN and GENEIN in acinar cells. These results suggest that the pro-inflammatory effect of CHEMICALIN may be mediated by GENEIN-GENEIN related pathway in mouse pancreatic acinar cells.
17618628	Thermodynamic determination of the binding constants of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors by a displacement method. Somatic angiotensin I-converting enzyme (s-ACE) plays a central role in blood pressure regulation and has been the target of most antihypertensive drugs. A displacement isothermal titration calorimetry method has been used to accurately determine the binding constant of three strong s-ACE inhibitors. Under the experimental conditions studied in this work, the relative potency of the inhibitors was determined to be enalaprilat>lisinopril>captopril. We analyze the thermodynamic behaviour of the binding process using the new structural information provided by the ACE structures, as well as the conformational changes that occur upon binding.
23624810	Antiaggressive activity of central oxytocin in male rats. RATIONALE: A substantial body of research suggests that the neuropeptide oxytocin promotes social affiliative behaviors in a wide range of animals including humans. However, its antiaggressive action has not been unequivocally demonstrated in male laboratory rodents. OBJECTIVE: Our primary goal was to examine the putative serenic effect of oxytocin in a feral strain (wild type Groningen, WTG) of rats that generally show a much broader variation and higher levels of intermale aggression than commonly used laboratory strains of rats. METHODS: Resident animals were intracerebroventricularly (icv) administered with different doses of synthetic oxytocin and oxytocin receptor antagonist, alone and in combination, in order to manipulate brain oxytocin functioning and to assess their behavioral response to an intruder. RESULTS: Our data clearly demonstrate that acute icv administered oxytocin produces dose-dependent and receptor-selective changes in social behavior, reducing aggression and potentiating social exploration. These antiaggressive effects are stronger in the more offensive rats. On the other hand, administration of an oxytocin receptor antagonist tends to increase (nonsignificantly) aggression only in low-medium aggressive animals. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that transiently enhancing brain oxytocin function has potent antiaggressive effects, whereas its attenuation tends to enhance aggressiveness. In addition, a possible inverse relationship between trait aggression and endogenous oxytocinergic signaling is revealed. Overall, this study emphasizes the importance of brain oxytocinergic signaling for regulating intermale offensive aggression. This study supports the suggestion that oxytocin receptor agonists could clinically be useful for curbing heightened aggression seen in a range of neuropsychiatric disorders like antisocial personality disorder, autism, and addiction.
23631499	Possible Therapeutic Uses of Salvia triloba and Piper nigrum in Alzheimer's Disease-Induced Rats. Abstract This study aimed to investigate the role of Salvia triloba L. and Piper nigrum extracts in ameliorating neuroinflammatory insults characteristic of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in an experimentally induced rat model. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were classified into Group 1 (n=10): normal healthy animals serving as the negative control group; Group 2 (n=60): the AD-induced group. After AD induction, animals in the AD-induced group were divided randomly and equally into 6 subgroups. The first subgroup served as AD control; the second one, which served as positive control, was treated orally with the conventional therapy for AD (CHEMICALNOTIN) at a dose of 0.3âmg/kg body weight (b.w.) daily for 3 months. The third and fourth subgroups were, respectively, treated orally with the S. triloba extract at a dose of 750 and 375âmg/kg b.w. daily for 3 months. The fifth and sixth subgroups were, respectively, treated orally with the P. nigrum extract at a dose of 187.5 and 93.75âmg/kg b.w. daily for 3 months. Levels of brain CHEMICALNOTIN (Ach), serum and brain GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), total GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were estimated. The results showed that administration of CHEMICALIN resulted in a significant elevation in the levels of GENEIN activity, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN accompanied with a significant depletion in the Ach level. Treatment of AD rats with each of the selected medicinal plant extracts caused marked improvement in the measured biochemical parameters. In conclusion, S. triloba and P. nigrum methanolic extracts have potent anti-inflammatory effects against neuroinflammation characterizing AD.
23578607	CHEMICALNOTIN conjugation attenuates biological activities of CHEMICALNOTIN from ginger. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a bioactive CHEMICALNOTIN compound isolated from fresh ginger with anti-inflammatory and phase II enzyme inducing activities. Here we describe the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-dependent metabolism and the effect of this metabolic transformation on the biological activities of CHEMICALNOTIN. Compared with other ginger compounds, such as CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN showed the most potent anti-inflammatory effect in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. The biological activities of CHEMICALNOTIN were attenuated by CHEMICALNOTIN antioxidants such as CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), but not CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALIN was metabolised by CHEMICALNOTIN to form a CHEMICALNOTIN conjugate (CHEMICALIN) in RAW 264.7 cells, via a potential mechanism involving the catalytic activity of GENEIN (GENEIN). CHEMICALNOTIN showed reduced biological activities compared with CHEMICALNOTIN in multiple biological assays. Together, these results indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN conjugation attenuates the biological activities of CHEMICALNOTIN and other CHEMICALNOTIN compounds.
23115325	CHEMICALIN as an allosteric modulator of GENEIN in colonic inflammation. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in mouse colonic smooth muscle cell is a complex containing a pore-forming subunit (GENENOTIN) and a GENENOTIN subunit (GENENOTIN). These channels contribute to the cellular excitability of smooth muscle cells and hence regulate the motility patterns in the colon. Whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to study the alterations in GENENOTIN in smooth muscle cells in experimental colitis. Colonic inflammation was induced in BALB/C mice after intracolonic administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN(CHEMICALNOTIN) currents were measured at a holding potential of -60 mV in high CHEMICALNOTIN external solution. The concentration response to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a GENEIN opener, was significantly shifted to the left in the inflamed smooth-muscle cells. Both the potency and maximal currents induced by CHEMICALNOTIN were enhanced in inflammation. The EC(50) values in control were 6259 nM (n = 10) and 422 nM (n = 8) in inflamed colon, and the maximal currents were 9.9 Â± 0.71 pA/pF (60 Î¼M) in control and 39.7 Â± 8.8 pA/pF (3 Î¼M) after inflammation. As was seen with CHEMICALNOTIN, the potency and efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) (10-1000 Î¼M) on CHEMICALNOTIN(CHEMICALNOTIN) currents were significantly greater in inflamed colon compared with controls. In control cells, pretreatment with 100 ÂµM CHEMICALNOTIN shifted the EC(50) for LEV-induced currents from 2838 (n = 6) to 154 (n = 8) nM. Sulfhydration of GENEIN (GENEIN) was induced by CHEMICALIN and colonic inflammation. These data suggest that sulfhydration of GENENOTIN induces allosteric modulation of CHEMICALNOTIN(CHEMICALNOTIN) currents in colonic inflammation.
17497253	[Short QT syndrome]. Short QT syndrome is a new genetic disorder associated with familial atrial fibrillation and/or sudden death or syncope. To date, different mutations in genes encoding for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) have been identified to cause the short QT syndrome. The mutations lead to a gain of function of the affected current (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN). The phenotype is characterized by a shortened QT interval<335 ms after correction for heart rate at rates<80 beats/min. Furthermore, the QT interval poorly adapts to heart rate. Patients exhibit shortened atrial and ventricular effective refractory periods and, in the majority, inducibility of ventricular fibrillation. Death occurs already in newborns. Therapy of choice seems to be the implantable cardioverter defibrillator because of the high incidence of sudden death. Pharmacological treatment has been studied and it could be demonstrated, that some mutant currents may be insufficiently suppressed by drugs targeted to block the specific current such as, e.g., CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN in patients with a mutation in the GENEIN-coding gene GENEIN (GENEIN). CHEMICALNOTIN proved to be efficient in prolonging the QT interval and normalizing the effective refractory periods in some patients.
6374639	The pure antiandrogen CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a candidate of choice for the combined antihormonal treatment of prostatic cancer: a review. The nonsteroidal antiandrogen CHEMICALIN ( CHEMICALIN ) weakly interacts with the prostatic cytosolic GENEIN and shows a fast dissociation rate. When administered to immature castrated rats up to the daily dose of 100 mg/kg, it is devoid of any androgenic activity but efficiently blocks the growth-promoting activity of CHEMICALNOTIN on ventral prostate and seminal vesicle weight, thus showing the characteristics of a pure antiandrogen. In intact animals, on the other hand, the antiandrogen administered alone exerts only a partial inhibition of prostate and seminal vesicle weight. This is due to the property of the pure antiandrogen to neutralize the inhibitory feedback effect of CHEMICALNOTIN at the pituitary level on the GENENOTIN responsiveness to GENENOTIN, as illustrated in vitro in rat anterior pituitary cells in culture as well as in vivo in intact and castrated animals. In intact animals, neutralization of the inhibitory feedback action of endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN leads to an increased GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN secretion, which partly overcomes the direct action of the antiandrogen at the level of the prostate and seminal vesicles. In fact, the plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentration is more than doubled 6 hr after the administration of 10 mg of CHEMICALNOTIN while plasma GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels are increased by 7- and 17-fold, respectively, after 14 days of similar daily treatment. Efficient neutralization of the androgenic action at the prostatic level in intact animals thus requires prevention of this escape phenomenon through inhibition of GENENOTIN secretion. Although inhibition of GENEIN release can be achieved by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, an optimal inhibitory effect on the prostate is obtained by the combined administration of the antiandrogen with an GENENOTIN agonist that causes a specific blockage of testicular CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis as well as an inhibition of the GENENOTIN responsiveness to GENENOTIN.
23104244	Cytochrome P450-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of Galgeun-tang. We evaluated the herb-drug interaction potential of Galgeun-tang (GGT) extracts, mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibition/induction. Further, the effects of fermentation on the CYP-mediated herb-drug interaction potential of GGT extracts were determined. As measured by LC-ESI/MS/MS, GGT extracts (0-300Î¼g/mL) showed no inhibitory activity toward eight CYP isoforms (1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, and 3A4) in pooled human liver microsomes, suggesting that GGT may have low potential for herb-drug interactions mediated by CYP inhibition. Hepatic CYP expression and activity in rats treated with GGT extracts twice per day for 1week was examined. Among the tested CYP isoforms (1A1, 1A2, 1B1, 2B1, 2C11, 2E1, 3A1, 3A2, and 4A1), CYP1B1 and 4A1 were increased by GGT extracts. Hepatic activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase, but not midazolam hydroxylase were also elevated. These results raise the possibility that GGT extracts may increase the toxicity of environmental toxicants through the elevating CYP-dependent metabolic activation. Interestingly, the increases in CYP1B1 and CYP4A1 levels, and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase, 7-pentoxyresorufin-O-depentylase, and chlorzoxazone 6-hydroxylase activities were attenuated by fermentation of GGT extract using Lactobacillus plantarum KFRI 402, but not 144. Further studies are needed to identify the CYP regulatory component(s) from GGT and determination its metabolism.
14600253	Mechanisms of CHEMICALIN uptake in the choroid plexus: studies in wild-type and GENEIN knockout mice. The choroid plexus uptake of CHEMICALIN was studied in GENEIN (GENEIN) wild-type and null mice as a function of temperature, transport inhibitors, pH, and saturability. At normal pH (7.4) and temperature (37 degrees C), the uptake of 1 microM CHEMICALIN was reduced by 83% in GENEIN(-/-) mice as compared with GENEIN(+/+) mice (p < 0.001). A further reduction was achieved in null animals by reducing the temperature to 4 degrees C, or by adding saturating concentrations of unlabeled CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (p < 0.05). CHEMICALIN coadministration could inhibit the uptake of CHEMICALIN in GENEIN(+/+) mice (p < 0.01) but not GENEIN(-/-) mice. Although a proton-stimulated uptake of CHEMICALIN was demonstrated in GENEIN(+/+) mice (pH 6.5 versus pH 7.4; p < 0.01), no pH dependence was observed in GENEIN(-/-) mice. Kinetic parameters for CHEMICALNOTIN (without CHEMICALNOTIN) in wild-type mice were: V(max) = 5.4 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 34 microM, and K(d) = 0.0069 microl/mg/min; in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, the parameters were: V(max) = 4.1 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 27 microM, and K(d) = 0.0064 microl/mg/min. In null animals, the kinetic parameters of CHEMICALNOTIN (without CHEMICALNOTIN) were: V(max) = 2.7 pmol/mg/min, K(m) = 110 microM, and K(d) = 0.0084 microl/mg/min; in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, only a K(d) = 0.010 microl/mg/min was observed. Based on kinetic and inhibitor analyses, it was determined that (under linear conditions), 80 to 85% of cefadroxil's uptake in choroid plexus is mediated by GENENOTIN, 10 to 15% by GENENOTIN, and 5% by nonspecific mechanisms. These findings demonstrate that GENEIN is the primary transporter responsible for CHEMICALIN uptake in the choroid plexus. Moreover, the data suggest a role for GENENOTIN in the clearance of peptidomimetics from cerebrospinal fluid.
16674097	Comparative proteomics of ovarian epithelial tumors. We analyzed 12 ovarian epithelial tumors using 2D PAGE-based comparative proteomics to construct intra- and inter-tumoral distance map trees and to discover surrogate biomarkers indicative of an ovarian tumor. The analysis was performed after laser microdissection of 12 fresh-frozen tissue samples, including 4 serous, 5 mucinous, and 3 endometrioid tumors, with correlation with their histopathological characteristics. Ovarian epithelial tumors and normal tissues showed an apparent separation on the distance map tree. Mucinous carcinomas were closest to the normal group, whereas serous carcinomas were located furthest from the normal group. All mucinous tumors with aggressive histology were separated from the low malignant potential (LMP) group. The benign-looking cysts adjacent to the intraepithelial carcinoma (IEC) showed an expression pattern identical to that of the IEC area. The extent of change on the lineages leading to the mucinous and serous carcinoma was 1.98-fold different. The overall gene expression profiles of serous or endometrioid carcinomas appeared to be less affected by grade or stage than by histologic type. The potential candidate biomarkers screened in ovarian tumors and found to be significantly up-regulated in comparison to normal tissues were as follows: NM23, annexin-1, protein phosphatase-1, ferritin light chain, proteasome alpha-6, and NAGK (N-acetyl glucosamine kinase). In conclusion, ovarian mucinous tumors are distinct from other ovarian epithelial tumors. LMP mucinous tumors showing histologically aggressive features belong to mucinous carcinoma on the proteomic basis.
23625750	The effects of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced experimental acute pancreatitis. The role of GENENOTIN and their distribution in the gastrointestinal tract have been widely investigated. Most of the reports discuss their role in intestinal inflammations. However, the role of GENENOTIN agonist in pancreatitis has not been well established. The aim of this study is (Ed note: Purpose statements should be in present tense) to evaluate the effects of the GENENOTIN agonist on the course of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced experimental acute pancreatitis (EAP). The experiments were performed on 80 male Wistar rats, 58 of which survived, subdivided into 3 groups: C-control rats, I-EAP group, and II-EAP group treated with the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN at a dose of 0.75Â mg/kg b.w. i.p. at 48, 24, 12 and 1Â h before and 1Â h after the injection of 5Â % CHEMICALNOTIN solution into the biliary-pancreatic duct. Serum for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN determinations and tissue samples for morphological examinations were collected at 2, 6, and 24Â h of the experiment. In the CHEMICALIN group, GENEIN activity was decreased with statistically high significance compared to group I. The activity of GENENOTIN was not significantly different among the experimental groups but higher than in the control group. The administration of CHEMICALNOTIN attenuated the histological parameters of inflammation as compared to untreated animals. The use of GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN attenuates EAP. Our findings suggest that stimulation of GENENOTIN plays a positive role in the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced EAP in rats.
23350847	CHEMICALIN as Selective GENEIN Inhibitors. We describe the discovery of several CHEMICALIN as potent and selective GENEIN inhibitors and the efforts that eventually led to the desired improvements in physicochemical properties and human whole blood potencies. Ultimately, our mouse model revealed unexpected toxicity that precluded us from further advancing this series.
23354393	Bioactive microconstituents and antioxidant properties of wild edible mushrooms from the island of Lesvos, Greece. Crude composition, fatty acids, sterols, total phenolic content (TPC), individual polyphenols and terpenic acids were determined in five wild edible mushrooms species (Lactarius deliciosus, Lactarius sanguifluus, Lactarius semisanguifluus, Russula delica, Suillus bellinii) from Lesvos Island, Greece. In addition, the DPPH scavenging capacity, the ferric ion reducing power (FRAP) and the ferrous ion chelating activity of mushroom methanolic extracts were assessed. Among sterols, ergosterol predominated at concentrations 9.2-18.0mg/100g fw. Total phenolic content of mushroom extracts ranged from 6.0 to 20.8mg GAE/100g fw. Up to 19 simple polyphenols were determined in mushrooms extracts, the more abundant being p-OH-benzoic acid, p-OH-phenylacetic acid, o-coumaric acid, ferulic acid and chrysin. In addition, the triterpenic acids oleanolic and ursolic were detected for the first time in mushrooms. All species exerted antioxidant activity and ferrous ion chelating capacity. Principal component analysis revealed good correlations between TPC, DPPH and FRAP but not with metal chelating activity. It seems that mushrooms polyphenols exert antiradical and reducing activities, but they are not strong metal chelators, the observed chelating ability being probably due to other classes of compounds. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the bioactive microconstituents and antioxidant activity of wild Greek edible mushrooms.
18559268	Optimization of CHEMICALIN binding to GENEIN: binding affinity dissection and incremental construction of a high-affinity analog of CHEMICALIN. The GENEIN binding affinities of a series of synthetic CHEMICALIN have been measured with the aims of dissecting individual group contributions and obtaining a rationale for the design of novel compounds with the ability to overcome drug resistance. As previously observed for CHEMICALNOTIN, the positive and negative contributions of the different substituents to the binding free energies are cumulative. By combining the most favorable substitutions we increased the binding affinity of CHEMICALNOTIN 500-fold. Insight into the structural basis for this improvement was gained with molecular modeling and NMR data obtained for GENEIN-bound CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN with affinities for GENEIN well above their affinities for GENEIN are shown not to be affected by multidrug resistance. This finding strongly indicates that optimization of the ligand-target interaction is a good strategy to overcome multidrug resistance mediated by GENENOTIN.
23182954	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and fine particulate matter (PM(2.5)) on rat system inflammation and cardiac function. In order to understand the toxic mechanisms of cardiovascular system injuries induced by ambient PM(2.5) and/or CHEMICALNOTIN, a subacute toxicological animal experiment was designed with exposure twice a week for 3 continuous weeks. Wistar rats were randomly categorized into 8 groups (n=6): 1 control group, 3 groups exposed to fine particulate matters (PM(2.5)) alone at 3 doses (0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mg/rat), 1 group to CHEMICALNOTIN (0.81 ppm) alone and 3 groups to CHEMICALNOTIN plus PM(2.5) at 3 doses (0.2, 0.8, or 3.2 mg/rat). Heart rate (HR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) was monitored at approximately 24-h both after the 3rd exposure and the last (6th) exposure, and systolic blood pressure (SBP) was monitored at approximately 24-h after the 6th exposure. Biomarkers of systemic inflammation and injuries (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN), heart oxidative stress (CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN) and endothelial function (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) were analyzed after the 6th exposure. Additionally, myocardial ultrastructural alterations were observed under transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for histopathological analyses. Results showed that PM(2.5) alone exposure could trigger the significant increase of GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and SBP and decrease of heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of cardiac autonomic nervous system (ANS) function. CHEMICALNOTIN alone exposure in rats did not show significant alterations in any indicators. CHEMICALIN plus PM(2.5) exposure, however, induced GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and CHEMICALNOTIN increase, GENEIN and HRV decrease significantly in a dose-response way. Meanwhile, abnormal ECG types were monitored in rats exposed to PM(2.5) with and without CHEMICALNOTIN and obvious myocardial ultrastructural changes were observed by TEM. In conclusion, PM(2.5) alone exposure could cause inflammation, endothelial function and ANS injuries, and CHEMICALNOTIN potentiated these effects induced by PM(2.5).
18465538	CHEMICALNOTIN Hoechst AG. Hoechst is developing CHEMICALNOTIN, a synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN based on an extract from an Indian plant, for the potential treatment of cancer. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor, arrests cell division and causes apoptosis in non-small lung cancer cells [283660]. A phase II trial, in collaboration with the National Cancer Institute, has commenced at the University of Chicago Medical Center, which involves patients with high or intermediate-grade lymphoma or multiple myeloma [272937], [277372]. In ex vivo experiments with tumor cells from refractory chronic lymphoblastic leukemia, dose-dependent GENEIN inhibition associated with apoptotic changes was seen at concentrations greater than 100 nM of CHEMICALIN. In vitro pharmacokinetic studies have shown that CHEMICALNOTIN undergoes hepatic biotransformation to its corresponding CHEMICALNOTIN by CHEMICALNOTIN glucoronosyltransferases [283791]. CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN with an IC50 value of 0.4 mM [285707]. Preclinical toxicology studies in rats and dogs demonstrated dose-related leukopenia and drug-related lesions in the thymus, spleen and bone marrow. The gastrointestinal and bone marrow toxicity was dose-limiting [178579]. Hoechst Marion Roussel expects to launch CHEMICALNOTIN in the year 2001, with potential sales in excess of DM 750 million [288651].
15110853	GENEIN inhibitors: CHEMICALIN incorporating CHEMICALIN moieties with strong anticonvulsant activity. A series of CHEMICALNOTIN incorporating CHEMICALNOTIN moieties were prepared by reaction of CHEMICALNOTIN with the CHEMICALNOTIN derived from CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Related derivatives were obtained from the above-mentioned CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. Some of these derivatives showed good inhibitory potency against two GENEIN isozymes involved in important physiological processes, GENEIN, and GENEIN, of the same order of magnitude as the clinically used drugs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. The lipophilicity of the best GENENOTIN inhibitors was determined and expressed as their experimental log k' IAM and theoretical ClogP value. Their lipophilicity was propitious with the crossing of the blood-brain barrier (log k' > IAM > 1.35). The anticonvulsant activity of some of the best GENENOTIN inhibitors reported here has been evaluated in a MES test in mice. After intraperitoneal injection (30 mg kg(-1)), compounds A8 and A9 exhibited a high protection against electrically induced convulsions (> 90%). Their ED50 was 3.5 and 2.6 mg kg(-1), respectively.
12067524	Enzymatic characterization of a recombinant isoform hybrid of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expressed in yeast. BACKGROUND AND AIMS: GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN) catalyses the conversion of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). The 65 kDa isoform, GENENOTIN is a potent autoantigen in type 1 diabetes, whereas GENENOTIN is not. A hybrid cDNA was created by fusing a human cDNA for CHEMICALIN 1-101 of GENEIN to a human cDNA for CHEMICALIN 96-585 of GENEIN; the recombinant (r) protein was expressed in yeast and was shown to have equivalent immunoreactivity to GENENOTIN with diabetes sera. We here report on enzymatic and molecular properties of GENENOTIN. METHODS: Studies were performed on enzymatic activity of GENENOTIN by production of CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALNOTIN, enzyme kinetics, binding to the enzyme cofactor CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), stability according to differences in pH, temperature and duration of storage, and antigenic reactivity with various GENENOTIN-specific antisera. RESULTS: The properties of GENENOTIN were compared with published data for GENENOTIN (brackets). These included a specific enzyme activity of 22.7 (16.7) nKat, optimal pH for enzymatic activity 7.4 (6.8), K(m) of 1.3 (1.3) mM, efficient non-covalent binding to the cofactor CHEMICALNOTIN, and high autoantigenic potency. The stability of GENENOTIN was optimal over 3 months at -80 degrees C, or in lyophilized form at -20 degrees C. CONCLUSIONS: Hybrid GENENOTIN has enzymatic and other properties similar to those of the mixed isoforms of GENENOTIN in preparations from mammalian brain as described elsewhere, in addition to its previously described similar immunoreactivity.
23421930	Bioactive phenolics from Seriphidium stenocephalum. Chromatographic separation of the ethyl acetate soluble part of the methanolic extract from Seriphidium stenocephalum yielded three new compounds: stenocepflavone (1), stenocepflavan (2), and stenocephol (3), together with cirsimaritin (4), 5,7,5'-trihydroxy-3',4',6-trimethoxyflavone (5), 5,6,7,5'-tetrahydroxy-4'-methoxyflavone (6), and axillaroside (7). All isolates were characterized with the help of spectroscopic data including 1D, 2D NMR, and high resolution mass spectrometry and/or in comparison with the related compounds in literature. All compounds were tested for in vitro enzyme inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase, butyrylcholinesterase, and lipoxygenase. Compounds 1 and 4-7 exhibited significant activity against all the tested enzymes, whereas compounds 2 and 3 were found inactive.
23541436	Anti-inflammatory effect of essential oil and its constituents from fingered citron (Citrus medica L. var. sarcodactylis) through blocking GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN signaling pathways in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells. We investigated the composition of essential oil from fingered citron (Citrus medica L. var. sarcodactylis) (FCEO) peels by GC-MS and its anti-inflammatory effects on lipopolysaccharide (LPS) - stimulated mouse macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells. Fifteen compounds, representing 98.97% of the essential oil, were tentatively identified; the main constituents were CHEMICALNOTIN (52.44%) and CHEMICALNOTIN (28.41%). FCEO significantly inhibited CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) by suppressing the protein expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN, respectively. Additionally, FCEO suppressed the production of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. FCEO attenuated LPS-induced GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation via inhibition of GENENOTIN phosphorylation. Furthermore, FCEO blocked activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) but not that of GENENOTIN. These results indicate that FCEO inhibits LPS-stimulated inflammation by blocking the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN pathways in macrophages, and demonstrate that FCEO possesses anti-inflammatory properties.
11969359	Modulation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN release from dispersed human nasal polyp cells and human whole blood by inhibitors of different GENENOTIN isoenzymes and glucocorticoids. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the inhibitors of different GENENOTIN isoenzymes (GENENOTIN) on the production of two pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of GENENOTIN inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on GENENOTIN release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced GENENOTIN release was most potently suppressed by selective GENENOTIN inhibitors. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, selective GENEIN inhibitors, suppressed GENEIN secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of CHEMICALIN (unspecific GENEIN inhibitor), CHEMICALIN (GENEIN inhibitor), EHNA (GENENOTIN inhibitor) and the GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were weak. In human blood, the tested glucocorticoids CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited the LPS induced GENEIN release potently in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids on allergically induced GENEIN release, with the exception of CHEMICALIN, was much less pronounced. Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GENENOTIN release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the GENENOTIN. The selective GENEIN inhibitors, and to a certain extent the GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, reduced the GENEIN release in a concentration dependent manner. In all investigations selective GENENOTIN inhibitors reduced GENENOTIN release to a much higher degree (4-10 fold) than GENENOTIN release.
23538162	Activating GENEIN-GENEIN signaling pathway contributes to CHEMICALIN protection against GENEIN-induced human endothelial cells apoptosis. The deposition of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in neurons and vascular cells of the brain has been characterized in Alzheimer's disease. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an active components in Panax ginseng, a famous traditional Chinese medicines recorded in Compendium of Materia Medica. Present study attempted to evaluate the potential mechanisms of GENENOTIN-mediated insult and the protective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on human endothelial cells. CHEMICALIN attenuated the GENEIN-associated mitochondrial apoptotic events, accompanied by inhibiting GENEIN expression followed by intracellular reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species generation, and protein nitrotyrosination. These protective effects were abolished by GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonist CHEMICALIN or GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN rather than GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN. Taken together, our results suggested that CHEMICALIN protected against GENEIN-induced apoptosis at least in part by two complementary GENEIN-dependent GENEIN phosphorylation pathways: (1) down-regulating GENEIN initiated protein nitrotyrosination, and (2) inhibiting mitochondrial apoptotic cascades. These data provided a novel insight to the mechanisms of CHEMICALINprotective effects on GENEIN-induced endothelial cells apoptosis, suggesting that GENEIN-GENEIN signaling pathway might play an important role in it.
23232123	Aberrant transcription of the LHCGR gene caused by a mutation in exon 6A leads to Leydig cell hypoplasia type II. The luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LHCGR) is essential for normal male sex differentiation. Recently, the additional primate-specific exon 6A of the LHCGR was discovered and it was shown to act as regulatory element at the transcriptional level. Compound heterozygous mutations in exon 6A (c.580 A>G) and exon 11 (c.1244T>C) were identified in the LHCGR of a male 46,XY patient with genital malformation. Analysis revealed that mutation c.580A>G in exon 6A affects the splicing pattern resulting in an increase of transcripts containing the internal variants of exon 6A prone to nonsense-mediated decay. In contrast, mutation c.1244T>C results in an amino acid substitution (Ile415Thr), which abolishes signal transduction due to structural changes. When inherited in a compound heterozygous fashion these mutations result in Leydig cell hypoplasia (LCH) type II. Thus this study provides proof that mutations causing aberrant transcription can impair receptor function and thereby be causative of LCH.
1386491	Effectiveness of GENEIN inhibition (CHEMICALIN) in congestive heart failure. CHEMICALIN is a novel, orally active inhibitor of GENEIN GENEIN, the enzyme that degrades GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The acute and chronic (10 days treatment) hemodynamic and hormonal effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (150 mg twice daily) in 12 patients with moderately severe congestive heart failure were investigated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. On study day 1, CHEMICALIN acutely increased plasma GENEIN levels, suppressed CHEMICALNOTIN and decreased right atrial and pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. After 10 days of treatment, basal GENENOTIN was increased and basal CHEMICALNOTIN was decreased. Body weight was reduced, most likely reflecting chronic natriuretic or diuretic effects, or both, and there was a trend toward increased cardiac index and reduced preload values. On study day 10, the acute effects of CHEMICALIN were similar to those on day 1 (i.e., GENEIN was further increased, CHEMICALNOTIN was suppressed, and right and left ventricular filling pressures were decreased). Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN may offer a new and effective therapeutic approach in the treatment of heart failure.
23357976	Longer GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in impaired CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance and type 2 diabetes. GENEIN encoded by the GENEIN gene converts CHEMICALIN to inactive CHEMICALIN, and alteration in this enzymatic activity might affect CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis by affecting circulating levels or tissue availability of glucocorticoids. We investigated the association of GENEIN variant with CHEMICALIN homeostasis. Subjects with normal CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance (n=585), impaired CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance (n=202) and type 2 diabetes (n=355) were genotyped for a highly polymorphic GENENOTIN polymorphism in the first intron of GENENOTIN. Allele and genotype frequencies differed between normal and impaired CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance (P = 0.0014 and 0.0407, respectively; 4DF) or type 2 diabetes (P = 0.0053 and 0.0078), with significant linear trends between the repeat length and the phenotype fraction. In normal subjects, total GENENOTIN length was negatively correlated with fasting GENENOTIN and HOMA-Î². Thus, subjects having more GENENOTIN are susceptible to developing abnormal CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance, whereas normal subjects carrying more GENENOTIN appeared to have frugal characteristics in GENENOTIN secretion.
14680444	Efficacy and safety of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of urological diseases. The GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, is selective for GENEIN. Both placebo-controlled and comparative studies with other agents have demonstrated CHEMICALNOTIN to be an effective treatment for patients with lower urinary symptoms suggestive of benign prostatic hyperplasia. Its effectiveness appears to be maintained over many years. CHEMICALNOTIN may also effectively reduce lower urinary tract symptoms in other urological diseases. A dose of CHEMICALNOTIN 0.4 mg/day has a tolerability close to that of placebo and has little, if any, blood pressure lowering effects. Tolerability and lack of blood pressure lowering are maintained even in high-risk patients such as those with cardiovascular comorbidity and/or comedication. Apart from GENENOTIN subtype-selectivity, a smooth pharmacokinetic profile of its modified-release formulation and a selective accumulation in target tissues may contribute to an excellent efficacy:tolerability ratio.
22989705	CHEMICALNOTIN protects against CHEMICALNOTIN induced nephrotoxicity in rats and potentiates its anticancer activity against human renal adenocarcinoma cell lines. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced nephrotoxicity is a serious problem that limits its use in cancer treatment. The present study aimed to investigate the renal protective capacity of CHEMICALNOTIN to reduce the CHEMICALNOTIN- induced nephrotoxicity. The underlying suggested mechanism(s) and whether this nephroprotective effect (if any) interferes with the cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on cancer cells were also investigated. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, IP injected (GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) antagonist), or their combination were administered to rats one hour before CHEMICALNOTIN injection. Moreover, their effects on the cell viability of human renal adenocarcinoma cell models (ACHN) were studied. The obtained results showed that CHEMICALIN improved the renal function, structural changes, renal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN) genes expression in CHEMICALIN injected rats. It increased both renal reduced CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) content and GENENOTIN gene expression. In contrast to the data obtained by prior administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN also potentiated the cytotoxic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on human renal adenocarcinoma cells and this effect was abolished by CHEMICALNOTIN co administration. In conclusion, these results suggested that CHEMICALIN protected against CHEMICALNOTIN- induced nephrotoxicity through its interaction with GENEIN receptors and antioxidant effects. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN did not interfere but rather potentiated the cytotoxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on human renal adenocarcinoma cells.
20801130	A structural and functional perspective into the mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitizers that target the cardiac GENENOTIN. The CHEMICALIN dependent interaction between GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) triggers contraction in heart muscle. Heart failure is characterized by a decrease in cardiac output, and compounds that increase the sensitivity of cardiac muscle to CHEMICALNOTIN have therapeutic potential. The CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitizer, CHEMICALNOTIN, targets cTnC; however, detailed understanding of its mechanism has been obscured by its instability. In order to understand how this class of positive inotropes function, we investigated the mode of action of two CHEMICALNOTIN containing novel analogs of CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). The affinities of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN for the regulatory domain of GENEIN were measured in the absence and presence of cTnI by NMR spectroscopy, and CHEMICALIN was found to bind more strongly than CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN also increased the affinity of GENEIN for GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN increased the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitivity of demembranated cardiac trabeculae in a manner similar to CHEMICALNOTIN. The high resolution NMR solution structure of the GENEIN-GENEIN-CHEMICALIN ternary complex showed that CHEMICALIN bound at the hydrophobic interface formed by GENEIN and GENEIN making critical interactions with residues such as Arg147 of GENEIN. In the absence of GENENOTIN, docking localized CHEMICALIN to the same position in the hydrophobic groove of GENEIN. The structural and functional data reveal that the CHEMICALIN class of CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitizers work by binding to the regulatory domain of GENEIN and stabilizing the pivotal GENEIN-GENEIN regulatory unit via a network of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions, in contrast to the destabilizing effects of antagonists such as W7 at the same interface.
17327465	Induction of GENENOTIN is a nonspecific biomarker of GENENOTIN activation: results of large scale screening of pharmaceuticals and toxicants in vivo and in vitro. Expression of GENENOTIN and its related enzyme activity have long been used as a biomarker for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activation and a warning of CHEMICALNOTIN-like toxicity. As a result, induction of GENENOTIN by pharmaceutical drug candidates or environmental contaminants raises significant concern in risk assessment. The current study evaluates the specificity of GENENOTIN induction as a marker for GENENOTIN affinity and activation and provides context to assess the relevancy of GENENOTIN activation to risk assessment. In vivo experiments examined the expression of GENENOTIN and other GENENOTIN-regulated genes in liver, kidney, and heart in response to 596 compounds. From this data set, a subset of 147 compounds was then evaluated for their ability to activate or bind to the GENENOTIN using a combination of gel shift, reporter gene, and competitive receptor binding assays. Whereas in vivo GENENOTIN mRNA expression is a sensitive marker for GENENOTIN activation, it lacks specificity, because 81 (59%) of 137 compounds were found to significantly induce GENENOTIN in vivo but were not verified to bind or activate the GENENOTIN in vitro. Combining in vivo and in vitro findings, we identified nine GENEIN agonists, six of which are marketed therapeutics and have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, including CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN. These drugs do not produce CHEMICALNOTIN-like toxicity in rats or in humans. These data demonstrate that induction of GENENOTIN is a nonspecific biomarker of direct GENENOTIN affinity and activation and lend further support to the hypothesis that GENENOTIN induction and/or GENENOTIN activation is not synonymous with CHEMICALNOTIN-like toxicity.
23563356	No mutations in the CHEMICALIN related GENEIN and GENENOTIN genes in patients with monogenic sclerosing bone disorders. Since the identification of GENENOTIN as the causative gene for the osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome (OPPG) as well as the high bone mass (HBM) phenotype, GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling have been extensively studied for their role in the differentiation and proliferation of osteoblasts, in the apoptosis of osteoblasts and osteocytes and in the response of bone to mechanical loading. However, more recently the direct effect of GENENOTIN on osteoblasts and bone formation has been questioned. Gene expression studies showed that mice lacking GENENOTIN have increased expression of GENENOTIN, the rate limiting enzyme for the production of CHEMICALNOTIN in the gut. Furthermore mice lacking either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN, the receptor for CHEMICALNOTIN on the osteoblasts, were reported to have an increased bone mass due to increased bone formation. This led to the still controversial hypothesis that GENENOTIN influences bone formation indirectly by regulating the expression of GENENOTIN and as a consequence influencing the production of CHEMICALNOTIN in the gut. Based on these data we decided to evaluate the role of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in the development of craniotubular hyperostoses, a group of monogenic sclerosing bone dysplasias. We screened the coding regions of both genes in 53 patients lacking a mutation in the known causative genes GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. We could not find disease-causing coding variants in neither of the tested genes and therefore, we cannot provide support for an important function of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in the pathogenesis of sclerosing bone dysplasias in our tested patient cohort.
23614367	Grb10-mediated Negative Regulation of IGF1R-Activated Signalling Pathway Results in Cognitive Disorder in Diabetic Rats. Growth factor receptor-bound protein 10(Grb10)is a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing protein and one of the binding partners for several trans-membrane tyrosine-kinase receptors, including insulin receptor (IR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R). The hippocampus, which is critical for cognitive functions, is one of the main distribution areas of Grb10 in the central nervous system. In recent years, diabetic encephalopathy has been defined as a third type of diabetes and the IGF1-IR pathway has been shown to be critical for the neuropathogenic process of cognitive disorder in diabetes. However, the role of endogenous Grb10 in regulating the IGF1-IR pathway and neurobehavioral changes is not explicit. The objective of this study was to determine the in vivo function of endogenous Grb10 in diabetic encephalopathy and the underlying mechanisms. Using stereotaxic surgical techniques and lentiviral vectors expressing specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we could steadily knock down Grb10 expression in the hippocampus. More importantly, we demonstrated that hippocampus-specific modulation of Grb10 protein levels led to a prominent remission of cognitive disorder, including improvements in both ultrastructural pathology and abnormal neurobehavioural changes. Our findings indicate that endogenous overexpression of Grb10 functions as a suppressor of the IGF1-IR pathway, which may represent an important mechanism that regulates cognitive disorder in diabetes.

23401474	Drug cocktail interaction study on the effect of the orally administered lavender oil preparation silexan on cytochrome p450 enzymes in healthy volunteers. This cocktail study evaluated the interaction potential of the oral lavender oil preparation silexan with major P450 (cytochrome P450) enzymes. Subjects and Methods: Sixteen healthy male or female Caucasians completed this double-blind, randomized, 2-fold crossover study. Silexan (160 mg) or placebo were administered once daily for 11 days. Additionally, on day 11 of both study periods, 150 mg caffeine (CYP1A2), 125 mg tolbutamide (CYP2C9), 20 mg omeprazole (CYP2C19), 30 mg dextromethorphan-HBr (CYP2D6), and 2 mg midazolam (CYP3A4) were administered orally. Formal interaction was excluded if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the silexan over placebo ratios for phenotyping metrics (primary: AUC0-t) was within a 0.70-1.43 range. Results: According to the AUC0-t comparisons, silexan had no relevant effect on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, and 3A4 activity. Secondary phenotyping metrics confirmed this result. Mean ratios for all omeprazole-derived metrics were close to unity. The 90% CI for the AUC0-t ratio of omeprazole but not for omeprazole/5-OH-omeprazole plasma ratio 3 hours post-dose or omeprazole/5-OH-omeprazole AUC0-t ratio (secondary CYP2C19 metrics) was above the predefined threshold of 1.43, probably caused by the inherent high variability of omeprazole pharmacokinetics. Silexan and the phenotyping drugs were well tolerated. Repeated silexan (160 mg/day) administration has no clinically relevant inhibitory or inducing effects on the CYP1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4 enzymes in vivo.
16546990	CHEMICALIN independently modulates GENENOTIN and GENEIN signaling pathways. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States. Substantial human and animal data support the ability of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to cause regression of existing colon tumors and prevent new tumor formation. The mechanism by which the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug CHEMICALNOTIN prevents tumor growth is poorly understood and seems complex as CHEMICALNOTIN can modulate several growth-related signaling pathways. CHEMICALIN metabolites simultaneously (a) increase cellular CHEMICALNOTIN and subsequently activate GENEIN (GENEIN); (b) activate GENEIN (GENEIN); (c) inhibit GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN); and (d) decrease GENEIN protein expression at times and doses consistent with apoptosis. The purpose of this study was to determine if GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN are independent targets for CHEMICALNOTIN in vitro. Pharmacologic activation of GENENOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN increases GENENOTIN phosphorylation and induces apoptosis in colon cancer cells without modulating GENENOTIN phosphorylation or GENENOTIN protein expression. Inhibition of GENENOTIN with CHEMICALIN induces apoptosis but fails to activate GENEIN phosphorylation or down-regulate GENEIN protein expression. Cotreatment with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN synergistically increases apoptosis in colorectal cancer cells and recapitulates the effects of CHEMICALIN treatment on GENENOTIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN metabolites modulate GENENOTIN and GENEIN pathways independently in colon cancer cells and suggest that the full apoptotic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN is mediated by more than one pathway. Using similar combinatorial approaches in vivo may provide more effective, less toxic chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic strategies. Such therapies could dramatically reduce the incidence and death rate from colorectal cancer.
10530931	Synthesis and antagonistic activity at GENEIN subtypes of some CHEMICALIN derivatives of CHEMICALIN. A series of CHEMICALNOTIN analogues of the muscarinic antagonist CHEMICALIN bearing 1-substituents of different lipophilic, electronic, and steric properties was synthesized and their affinity for the GENEIN subtypes was evaluated by functional tests. Two derivatives (2g and 2d) showed an GENENOTIN-selective profile which was confirmed by functional tests on the GENENOTIN. A possible relationship between GENENOTIN selectivity and lipophilicity of the 1-substituent was suggested by structure-activity analysis. This work showed that appropriate structural modification of CHEMICALIN can lead to GENEIN-selective muscarinic antagonists of possible interest in the field of Alzheimer's disease.
23266505	Activation of an apoptotic signal transduction pathway involved in the upregulation of GENEIN and GENEIN in CHEMICALIN-induced primary cultured cardiomyocytes. In this study, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-induced apoptosis of cardiomyocyte was evaluated based on the previous studies, and the roles of GENEIN signaling were clarified. Primary cultured rat cardiomyocytes were injured by CHEMICALNOTIN (0.01-10 Î¼M) for varying time periods. Then, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) (0.5 mM), CHEMICALNOTIN (2.5 Î¼M), and CHEMICALNOTIN (10 Î¼M) were evaluated on cardiomyocytes activated by CHEMICALNOTIN. Cardiomyocytes that were injured by CHEMICALNOTIN were assayed by the CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN leakage ratio. Apoptosis was evaluated by a TUNEL assay, annexin V/PI staining, and GENENOTIN activity. The expression of cleavage of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was evaluated by western blot analysis. CHEMICALIN increased GENEIN expression and GENEIN activity and promoted Bid cleavage. It also induced the release of GENENOTIN from mitochondria into the cytosol. The upregulation of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN activity were further inhibited by treatment with CHEMICALIN in the presence of CHEMICALIN. Additionally, GENEIN levels in the cytosol decreased due to CHEMICALIN but not due to CHEMICALIN. This was also accompanied by a significant decrease in apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with CHEMICALIN not only attenuated the pro-apoptotic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN but reversed the CHEMICALIN-induced increase of GENEIN and GENEIN levels.
2855105	CHEMICALIN, an opiate analog, differently modifies the GENEIN responses to GENEIN and GENEIN in patients with Addison's disease. CHEMICALIN is a peripheral opiate agonist able to inhibit GENEIN secretion. In this work, the interactions between CHEMICALNOTIN and two GENENOTIN secretagogues, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), were investigated in patients with Addison's disease. After CHEMICALNOTIN (16 mg orally) or placebo administration, 5 patients received CHEMICALNOTIN (0.06 IU/kg i.v. over 1 h) and 6 patients received GENENOTIN (1 micrograms/kg i.v. as bolus). In all patients CHEMICALIN induced a significant fall in plasma GENEIN levels. CHEMICALNOTIN increased GENENOTIN levels after both CHEMICALNOTIN (from 48 +/- 17.3 to a peak of 95 +/- 21 pmol/l) and placebo (from 231 +/- 59.5 to 365 +/- 86.6 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was not significant. GENENOTIN caused a rise in plasma GENENOTIN after both CHEMICALNOTIN (from 30 +/- 16.6 to a peak of 108 +/- 31 pmol/l) and placebo (from 98.5 +/- 47 to 211 +/- 61.7 pmol/l): the interaction between treatments and time was significant, and the first phase of GENEIN-induced GENEIN secretion was significantly lower after CHEMICALIN. These data demonstrate that CHEMICALIN differently modifies the stimulatory action of GENEIN and GENEIN on GENEIN secretion: namely, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN act in an additive manner, while GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN interact in a non additive way. Although these findings might be explained by the involvement of different intracellular GENENOTIN-secreting mechanisms, an influence of CHEMICALIN on some suprapituitary factors modulating the GENEIN response is suggested.
8103526	Comparisons of beta-adrenergic blocking properties of CHEMICALNOTIN in humans. In animals, the CHEMICALIN causes a significant reduction in intraocular pressure but had only 1/80 the activity of the S-enantiomer at GENEIN. The GENENOTIN blocking properties of orally administered CHEMICALNOTIN were compared in a double-blind placebo controlled trial in two groups of healthy men. Each subject in group A (n = 6) received placebo, 1 and 3 mg CHEMICALNOTIN and 25 and 75 mg CHEMICALNOTIN in random order, group B (n = 5) received placebo, 0.5, and 1 mg CHEMICALNOTIN and 3 and 10 mg CHEMICALNOTIN. In both groups, CHEMICALNOTIN comparably inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increases in heart rate (P < .05), forearm blood flow (P < .05, except at 3 micrograms/minute of CHEMICALNOTIN after the R-doses in group B), and finger tremor (P < .05) in comparison with placebo. The findings for the R-enantiomer in this study were unexpected based on the animal studies and previous studies that demonstrated marked differences in beta blocking effects of other beta-blockers in which the R-enantiomers were less inhibitory.
23116643	CHEMICALNOTIN ameliorates acute liver damage and fibrogenesis in CHEMICALNOTIN-intoxicated mice. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of CHEMICALNOTIN (RA), a natural phenolic, in the treatment of acute liver toxicity. RA at 10, 25 and 50mg/kg was administered by gavage once daily for 2 consecutive days, 6h after CHEMICALNOTIN intoxication. CHEMICALIN intoxication caused hepatic necrosis and increased serum GENEIN activity. In the livers, oxidative/nitrosative stress was evidenced by increased CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN reactive substances (TBARS) formation and a significant decrease in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity. CHEMICALIN administration triggered inflammatory response in mice livers by activating GENEIN (GENEIN), which coincided with the induction of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). RA improved histological and serum markers of liver damage and significantly ameliorated oxidative/nitrosative stress and inflammatory response in liver tissue. Additionally, RA prevented GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression, suggesting suppression of profibrotic response. Furthermore, RA significantly inhibited the CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis, which was evident from decreased cleavage of GENEIN. The hepatoprotective activity of RA coincided with enhanced GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression. The results of this study indicates that RA possesses antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiapoptotic and antifibrotic activity against acute liver toxicity.
9399012	Pre-clinical pharmacology of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALIN), a centrally and peripherally acting GENEIN agonist for migraine. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALIN) is a novel GENEIN receptor agonist with proven efficacy in the acute treatment of migraine with or without preceding aura. The drug differs from presently available members of this drug class in that it combines GENENOTIN receptor partial agonist activity with robust oral pharmacokinetics and an ability to inhibit trigeminovascular activation centrally as well as peripherally in preclinical studies. Consistent with its selectivity for GENEIN receptors, CHEMICALIN produces constriction of various isolated blood vessels, most notably cranial arteries. In anaesthetized animals, these vascular effects manifest as a selective constriction of cranial arterio-venous anastomoses resulting in a redistribution of carotid arterial blood flow. This effect is produced without significant effects on heart rate, blood pressure or blood flow to the brain, heart or lungs. CHEMICALNOTIN also inhibits trigeminal-evoked increases in cerebral blood flow in anaesthetized cats and blocks trigeminal-evoked plasma protein extravasation in the dura of guinea-pigs. These actions are consistent with a pre-junctional inhibition of neuropeptide release from perivascular afferents of the trigeminal nerve, as confirmed by independent studies showing that CHEMICALIN blocks elevations of GENEIN in jugular venous blood during electrical stimulation of the trigeminal ganglion. In all of these effects, CHEMICALNOTIN is three to four times more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN, but produces the same maximum response. CHEMICALNOTIN crosses the intact blood-brain barrier to inhibit trigeminovascular activation in the brainstem. This was shown initially by the ability of the drug to block a brainstem reflex provoking vasoactive intestinal peptide release from the VIIth cranial (facial) nerve during trigeminal stimulation. Subsequent ex vivo autoradiography confirmed that intravenously injected CHEMICALNOTIN labels a discrete population of cells in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis (TNC) and nucleus tractus solitarius. Direct evidence for a central neuromodulatory effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was provided by electrophysiological experiments which clearly demonstrated that the drug inhibits the excitability of cells in the TNC after systemic administration. This novel pre-clinical profile not only distinguishes CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALNOTIN, but raises intriguing questions about the clinical relevance of a dual action. Studies to date show that CHEMICALNOTIN indeed modulates cranial sensory processing in humans, yet central side-effects are no different from CHEMICALNOTIN. This property may account for the remarkable consistency in clinical efficacy observed in clinical trials.
23411272	Oligomeric CHEMICALNOTIN of lotus seedpod inhibits the formation of advanced glycation end-products by scavenging reactive CHEMICALNOTIN. It has been reported that oligomeric CHEMICALIN of lotus seedpod (LSOPC) is effective in the alleviation of Alzheimer's disease and diabetes through its antioxidant and GENEIN-potentiating activities. This study investigated the anti-glycative activity of LSOPC in a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-CHEMICALNOTIN model. The level of glycation and conformational alterations were assessed by specific fluorescence, Congo red binding assay and circular dichroism. The results show that LSOPC has a significant anti-glycative activity in vitro and it can also effectively protect the secondary structure of GENENOTIN during glycation. LSOPC or CHEMICALNOTIN (a major constituent unit of LSOPC), were used to react with CHEMICALNOTIN. The structures of their CHEMICALNOTIN adducts were tentatively identified using HPLC-MS(2). Their capacity to scavenge CHEMICALNOTIN suggested CHEMICALNOTIN scavenging as a major mechanism of antiglycation. Therefore, LSOPC could be helpful to prevent AGEs-associated diseases, and with the potential to be used as functional food ingredients.
17210712	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-peg5,000mw) inhibits the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of human hepatocellular carcinoma through CHEMICALNOTIN depletion. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is believed to be auxotrophic for CHEMICALNOTIN through the lack of expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The successful use of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) to treat GENENOTIN-deficient tumors has opened up new possibilities for effective cancer therapy. Nevertheless, many GENENOTIN-positive HCC cell lines are found to be resistant to GENENOTIN treatment, although most require CHEMICALNOTIN for proliferation. Thus far, an GENENOTIN for killing GENENOTIN-positive tumors has not been reported. Here, we provide direct evidence that recombinant GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibits GENENOTIN-positive HCCs. All the five human HCC cell lines we used were sensitive to GENENOTIN but GENENOTIN had virtually no effect on these cells. They all expressed GENENOTIN, but not GENEIN (GENEIN), the enzyme that converts CHEMICALIN, the product of degradation of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN, to CHEMICALIN, which is converted back to CHEMICALIN via GENEIN. Transfection of HCC cells with GENENOTIN resulted in resistance to GENENOTIN. Thus, GENENOTIN expression alone may be sufficient to induce GENENOTIN resistance in GENENOTIN-positive HCC cells. This surprising correlation between the lack of GENENOTIN expression and sensitivity of GENENOTIN-positive HCC cells shows that GENENOTIN-deficient HCCs are sensitive to GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN depletion. Therefore, pretreatment tumor gene expression profiling of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN could aid in predicting tumor response to CHEMICALIN depletion with GENEIN. We have also shown that the GENENOTIN native enzyme and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-peg(5,000mw)) gave similar anticancer efficacy in vitro. Furthermore, the growth of the GENENOTIN-deficient Hep3B tumor cells (GENENOTIN-positive and GENENOTIN-resistant) in mice was inhibited by treatment with GENENOTIN-peg(5,000mw), which is active alone and is synergistic in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, our data suggest that GENENOTIN-peg(5,000mw) is a novel agent for effective cancer therapy.
23259841	Visualization and virtual screening of the chemical universe database GDB-17. The chemical universe database GDB-17 contains 166.4 billion molecules of up to 17 atoms of C, N, O, S, and halogens obeying rules for chemical stability, synthetic feasibility, and medicinal chemistry. GDB-17 was analyzed using 42 integer value descriptors of molecular structure which we term "Molecular Quantum Numbers" (MQN). Principal component analysis and representation of the (PC1, PC2)-plane provided a graphical overview of the GDB-17 chemical space. Rapid ligand-based virtual screening (LBVS) of GDB-17 using the city-block distance CBD(MQN) as a similarity search measure was enabled by a hashed MQN-fingerprint. LBVS of the entire GDB-17 and of selected subsets identified shape similar, scaffold hopping analogs (ROCS > 1.6 and T(SF) < 0.5) of 15 drugs. Over 97% of these analogs occurred within CBD(MQN) â¤ 12 from each drug, a constraint which might help focus advanced virtual screening. An MQN-searchable 50 million subset of GDB-17 is publicly available at www.gdb.unibe.ch .
10225363	Both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors modulate GENENOTIN expression within rat trigeminal nucleus caudalis. A possible mechanism of action of antimigraine drugs such as CHEMICALNOTIN is inhibition of the trigeminovascular pathway. Sumatriptan's effects might be mediated by GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN receptors. To establish the relative importance of these subtypes, we compared the effects of CHEMICALIN with those of a selective GENEIN receptor agonist (CHEMICALIN) on GENEIN protein expression in the trigeminal nucleus caudalis. GENEIN expression was induced in CHEMICALNOTIN-anaesthetized rats by intracisternal CHEMICALIN administration. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN decreased the number of CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN-like immunoreactive cells within trigeminal nucleus caudalis (ID50 = 0.04 and 0.6 mg kg(-1)). The effect of CHEMICALIN, but not of CHEMICALIN, was prevented by pretreatment with the antagonist CHEMICALIN, which displays high affinity for GENEIN receptors. CHEMICALIN appears to attenuate c-fos-like immunoreactivity via GENEIN receptors, while CHEMICALIN acts via GENEIN receptors. The fact that activation of GENENOTIN receptors is sufficient to modulate the activity of the trigeminal system suggests that this receptor may be a target for antimigraine drugs with improved safety profile.
23349485	Disruption of the cereblon gene enhances hepatic AMPK activity and prevents high fat diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in mice. A nonsense mutation in cereblon (CRBN) causes a mild type of mental retardation in humans. An earlier study showed that CRBN negatively regulates the functional activity of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vitro by binding directly to the Î±1 subunit of the AMPK complex. However, the in vivo role of CRBN was not studied. To elucidate the physiological functions of Crbn, a mouse strain was generated in which the Crbn gene was deleted throughout the whole body. In Crbn-deficient mice fed a normal diet, AMPK in the liver showed hyper-phosphorylation, which indicated the constitutive activation of AMPK. Since Crbn-deficient mice showed significantly less weight gain when fed a high fat diet and their insulin sensitivity was considerably improved, the functions of Crbn in the liver were primarily investigated. These results provide the first in vivo evidence that Crbn is a negative modulator of AMPK, which suggests that Crbn may be a potential target for metabolic disorders of the liver.
16516814	Involvement of GENEIN and GENEIN in the regulation of the GENEIN by CHEMICALIN in MDCK cells. CHEMICALNOTIN are key regulators of ion transport in the kidney. In MDCK cells, which model distal tubule cells, the transcription of the GENENOTIN subunit is regulated by PGE1 and PGE2. To identify the GENENOTIN that mediate transcriptional regulation, transient transfection studies are conducted using the human beta1promoter/luciferase construct, pHbeta1-1141 Luc. The involvement of GENEIN and GENEIN is indicated by studies with the GENEIN selective agonist CHEMICALIN, and the GENEIN selective agonist CHEMICALIN (which stimulate), as well as by studies with the antagonists CHEMICALIN (EP1 specific) and CHEMICALIN (GENEIN and GENEIN specific). Consistent with the involvement of GENENOTIN coupled GENENOTIN, is that the CHEMICALNOTIN stimulation is inhibited by the GENENOTIN expression vector (encoding the GENENOTIN), as well as by the GENENOTIN PKI. In addition to this evidence (for the involvement of GENENOTIN), evidence for the involvement of GENEIN in the CHEMICALIN mediated stimulation of GENEIN subunit gene transcription includes the stimulatory effect of CHEMICALIN, as well as the inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN. Also consistent with the involvement of GENENOTIN coupled GENEIN, the CHEMICALIN stimulation is inhibited by the GENENOTIN vector (encoding the GENENOTIN), the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, as well as the GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN.
21272013	GENENOTIN: a dynamic regulator of brain monoaminergic neuronal function interacting with drugs of abuse. The monoaminergic neuron, in particular the dopaminergic neuron, is central to mediating the hedonic and addictive properties of drugs of abuse. The effects of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), for example, depend on the ability to increase CHEMICALNOTIN in the synapse, by effects on either the plasma membrane transporter GENEIN or the vesicular transporter for CHEMICALNOTIN storage, GENEIN. The potential role of GENEIN as a target for CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN has been reviewed extensively. Here, we present GENENOTIN as a target that enables the rewarding and addictive actions of these drugs, based on imaging, neurochemical, biochemical, cell biological, genetic, and immunohistochemical evidence. The presence of GENENOTIN in noradrenergic, serotoninergic, histaminergic, and potentially trace aminergic neurons invites consideration of a wider role for aminergic neurotransmission in CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN abuse and addiction.
23410798	Spiro heterocycles as potential inhibitors of GENEIN: CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated synthesis of novel CHEMICALIN. Novel CHEMICALIN were designed as potential inhibitiors of GENEIN. These compounds were synthesized in good yields by using CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN mediated coupling-cyclization strategy as a key step involving the reaction of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN. Some of the compounds synthesized have shown encouraging inhibition of GENENOTIN protein (a yeast homologue of GENENOTIN) in vitro and three of them showed dose dependent inhibition of GENENOTIN. The docking results suggested that the CHEMICALNOTIN ring of CHEMICALNOTIN ring system of these molecules occupied the deep hydrophobic pocket of the protein and one of the CHEMICALNOTIN along with the CHEMICALNOTIN group participated in strong CHEMICALNOTIN-bonding interaction with the CHEMICALNOTIN residues.
10200320	CHEMICALIN suppress activation of microglia: down-regulation of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. Mechanisms leading to down-regulation of activated microglia and astrocytes are poorly understood, in spite of the potentially detrimental role of activated glia in neurodegeneration. CHEMICALNOTIN, produced both by neurons and glia, may serve as mediators of glial and neuronal functions. We examined the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN and their precursors on activated glia. As models of glial activation, production of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was studied in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated rat microglia, a murine microglial cell line BV-2, and GENENOTIN-stimulated rat astrocytes. CHEMICALIN were potent inhibitors of GENEIN induction and were more effective than their precursors, CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) was the most potent CHEMICALNOTIN among those tested. In activated microglia, CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN activity, GENEIN mRNA, and protein levels. The action of CHEMICALIN does not appear to involve its nuclear receptor GENEIN (GENEIN) because CHEMICALIN, a specific ligand of GENEIN, was unable to inhibit GENEIN induction, and neither CHEMICALIN nor CHEMICALIN could stimulate the activity of a GENEIN-dependent promoter in the absence of cotransfected GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN did not block nuclear translocation or DNA-binding activity of the transcription factor GENEIN, but it did inhibit the activity of an GENEIN reporter construct, suggesting that the mechanism of suppression of microglial GENEIN by CHEMICALIN may involve interference with GENEIN transcriptional activity in the nucleus. Thus, our data suggest the existence of a novel pathway mediated by CHEMICALNOTIN, which may represent part of a feedback mechanism leading to the cessation of inflammatory glial responses in the brain.
3828735	Mechanism of the haemostatic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in the injection sclerotherapy for oesophageal varices. Changes in coagulation and fibrinolysis were investigated in 20 patients with oesophageal varices, who underwent endoscopic injection sclerotherapy (EIS) with 5 per cent CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), by means of serial determination of plasma GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). One hour after the completion of EIS, the value of GENENOTIN was significantly increased to 38.1 +/- 11.1 ng/ml (mean +/- s.e.m.) from a pre-EIS value of 7.1 +/- 1.4 ng/ml (P less than 0.01) and it gradually returned to normal range by 48 h after EIS. A very similar change was observed in the value of GENENOTIN (P less than 0.01). These observations indicated that EIS provokes transient activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis. In vitro studies, however, revealed that CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN clot formation because of the CHEMICALNOTIN-chelating ability of its constituent CHEMICALNOTIN, although CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN exhibited procoagulant activity in GENEIN formation in vitro. Nevertheless, an external application of CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN over decapsulized kidney of rat resulted in a significant accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN-labelled GENENOTIN. From these results it was suggested that intravascular injection of CHEMICALNOTIN, which exerts an inhibitory effect on coagulation in vitro, activates the local coagulation system. The activation may be accelerated by an acute inflammatory process provoked by CHEMICALIN, which is supported by such clinical manifestations as mild fever, retrosternal pain leukocytosis and an increase in plasma GENEIN level which was observed in all during the period.
12093311	Renal failure associated with the use of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. OBJECTIVE: CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are two relatively new nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that selectively inhibit the GENEIN (GENEIN) isoenzyme at therapeutic concentrations. The nephrotoxic potential of selective GENENOTIN inhibitors has not been clearly established. This study was conducted in order to understand the association between acute renal failure and the two GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. METHODS: A search was performed in the US Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) to identify cases of renal failure submitted to the FDA. A MEDLINE search of the English language literature was also performed to identify published cases of renal failure associated with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-two and 142 domestic US cases of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-associated renal failure, respectively, were identified in the AERS database. The literature search identified 19 cases of acute renal impairment in association with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. In addition, drug regulatory authorities in the UK, Canada, and Australia have received about 50 reports of renal failure with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Descriptive statistics of the AERS cases have been summarised in this report. CONCLUSIONS: Data from AERS and published case reports suggest that use of both these drugs is associated with renal effects similar to that of conventional nonselective NSAIDs. Physicians should be aware that serious or life-threatening renal failure has been reported in patients with normal or impaired renal function after short-term therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Patients at greatest risk for renal injury are those with pre-existing renal impairment, heart failure, liver dysfunction, those taking diuretics and/or GENENOTIN inhibitors, and the elderly. Kidney function should be monitored closely for any signs of potential renal injuries soon after initiating treatment with these agents, especially in high-risk populations. In addition, healthcare practitioners should adequately warn patients of the signs and symptoms of serious renal toxicity, and of the need for them to see their physician promptly if they occur. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are not recommended for use in patients with advanced renal disease.
8799556	Evaluation of the pharmacological selectivity profile of GENENOTIN antagonists at prostatic GENENOTIN: binding, functional and in vivo studies. 1. The profile of a range of GENENOTIN antagonists was determined in vitro against cloned GENENOTIN and against CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of rat aorta and human prostate. The in vivo profile of compounds was determined in an anaesthetized dog model which allowed the simultaneous assessment of antagonist potency against CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated increases in blood pressure and prostatic pressure. 2. The CHEMICALIN antagonists, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN displayed high affinity but were non selective for the three cloned GENEIN. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN showed selectivity for GENENOTIN relative to the GENEIN. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN showed selectivity for GENENOTIN relative to the GENEIN. CHEMICALIN showed high affinity and selectivity for GENEIN (pKi 8.6) relative to GENEIN (pKi = 7.3) and GENEIN (pKi = 7.1) subtypes. 3. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN appeared to act as competitive antagonists of CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of rat aorta yielding pA2 affinity estimates which were similar to binding affinities at cloned GENEIN. The following rank order was obtained: CHEMICALNOTIN = CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN = CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN = CHEMICALNOTIN. 4. CHEMICALNOTIN was a very potent, insurmountable antagonist of CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of human prostate, yielding an approximate pA2 estimate of 9.8 at 1 nM. The corresponding (+)-enantiomer was 30 fold weaker. SL 89,0591, SNAP 1069 and Rec 15/2739 yielded pA2 estimates which compared well with their GENENOTIN binding affinities. The affinity estimate for CHEMICALIN on human prostate was lower than the corresponding binding affinity determined at GENEIN and CHEMICALIN was a very weak antagonist on human prostate (pA2 = 6.0) relative to the high affinity (pKi = 8.6) determined at cloned GENEIN. 5. In the anaesthetized dog, in vivo pseudo "pA2' values showed that CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increases in prostatic and blood pressure with similar affinity, implying that these agents show little or no selectivity for prostatic responses in this model. SL 89,0591 and SNAP 1069 were moderately selective (3 and 6 fold respectively) for prostatic pressure relative to blood pressure. CHEMICALNOTIN was a more potent antagonist of CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated increases in prostatic pressure ("pA2' = 8.74) compared to blood pressure ("pA2' = 7.51). 6. Data in this study suggest that the GENEIN mediating CHEMICALIN-induced contractions of human prostate, whilst having some of the characteristics of an GENENOTIN, cannot be satisfactorily aligned with cloned GENENOTIN. In addition, studies in the anaesthetized dog have shown that agents having high affinity and selectivity for prostatic GENENOTIN, particularly over the GENENOTIN, appear to inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increases in prostatic pressure selectively compared to blood pressure.
8925876	In functional experiments, CHEMICALIN is selective, not for the B, but for the A subtype of GENEIN. The potency of the antipsychotic drug, CHEMICALIN, to antagonize GENEIN-mediated contraction in rat vas deferens and vasoconstriction in rat perfused kidney, and GENEIN-mediated contractions in spleen from guinea-pig and mouse was evaluated and compared to that of GENEIN subtype-discriminating antagonists. CHEMICALIN was found to be unselective; CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were confirmed as selective for the GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN was weakly alpha 1B-selective. CHEMICALIN was equipotent to CHEMICALIN at GENEIN in rat vas deferens and kidney. However, at GENEIN, the affinity values of CHEMICALIN were 10-fold lower than those of CHEMICALIN. Thus, in functional experiments the presumed high selectivity of CHEMICALIN for the B subtype of GENEIN could not be confirmed, the drug instead appears to be moderately selective (10-fold) for the A subtype.
16497876	New assignments for multitasking signal transduction inhibitors. An article presented in this issue of Molecular Pharmacology (p. 1527) provides an intriguing example of how GENENOTIN inhibitors can be put to many uses. In this article, the action of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is contrasted with that of CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor that is currently being used to treat chronic myelogenous leukemia and other disorders. Both pharmacologic inhibitors target several GENENOTIN, including GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Up to this point, the GENENOTIN has not been a primary therapeutic target for this class of agents. The work of Chen and colleagues shows that CHEMICALIN is a particularly potent inhibitor of GENEIN and that the compound also targets GENEIN. The authors suggest that this combination of activities could be useful in the treatment of vascular obstructive diseases. Although a lack of absolute specificity has typically been regarded as a pharmacologic drawback, this study exemplifies how drugs with multiple molecular targets can potentially provide a very beneficial spectrum of therapeutic activities in multiple disease states.
9928259	GENENOTIN function in vivo: assessment by chronoamperometry. Local application of selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, prolonged the clearance of exogenously administered CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in both the dentate gyrus and CA3 region of the dorsal hippocampus, as measured using in vivo chronoamperometry. These effects were abolished in rats pretreated with CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN uptake inhibitors, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, did not alter the CHEMICALNOTIN signal in the CA3 region, but prolonged the clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN in the dentate gyrus; this effect was absent in rats pretreated with CHEMICALNOTIN. From these data, it is inferred that both the GENEIN and GENEIN contribute to the active clearance of exogenously applied CHEMICALIN in the dentate gyrus. In another experiment, CHEMICALIN, an antagonist of the GENEIN, also prolonged the clearance of CHEMICALNOTIN from the CA3 region. These and other data have generated a working hypothesis that activation of the terminal GENEIN enhances the kinetics of CHEMICALIN uptake through an effect on the GENEIN.
2530096	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced amnesia in mice. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced amnesia were investigated in a step-down passive avoidance task in mice. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly improved CHEMICALNOTIN-induced amnesia. This effect was inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN, but was potentiated by CHEMICALNOTIN. The anti-amnesic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced memory impairment was also antagonized by a CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) releaser, CHEMICALNOTIN, and by a CHEMICALNOTIN precursor, CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas a GENEIN-selective agonist, CHEMICALIN, was inactive. The memory-improving effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced amnesia was potentiated by a selective GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that the beneficial effect of CHEMICALIN on CHEMICALIN-induced amnesia may be related not only to cholinergic but also serotonergic neuronal systems (GENEIN).
22532505	Extracts of Scutellaria baicalensis reduced body weight and blood triglyceride in db/db Mice. Scutellaria baicalensis has been extensively employed for the clinical treatment of hyperlipidemia, atherosclerosis, hypertension, dysentery, inflammatory diseases, and the common cold. The present study was performed to investigate the anti-obesity and anti-dyslipidemia effect of Scutellaria baicalensis extracts (SBE) in type 2 diabetic db/db mice. Male db/db mice were divided into three groups (nâ=â5) and orally administrated vehicle (control), SBE 10, and 100âmg/kg body weight/day for 4âweeks everyday. Administration of SBE improves weight gain, hypertriglyceridemia, and hyperinsulinemia in db/db mice. In obese db/db mice, SBE treatment also reduced plasma alanine aminotransferase levels. In the livers of db/db mice, SBE promoted 5' AMP-activated protein kinase activity and restored metabolic process and insulin signaling pathways. Our data demonstrate that SBE exerts potent anti-obesity and anti-hypertriglyceride effects suggesting its useful potential function as adjuvant therapeutic agent for the treatment of weight gain and hypertriglyceridemia.
12742526	Altered CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism in long living Ames dwarf mice. Ames dwarf mice (df/df) are deficient in GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN and live significantly longer than their normal siblings. In the current study, we found that the hormone deficiencies affect CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism. We previously reported that the dwarf mice exhibit enzyme activities and levels that combat oxidative stress more efficiently than those of normal mice. Moreover, CHEMICALNOTIN or metabolites of CHEMICALNOTIN are involved in antioxidative processes. Thus, we performed an experiment that compared various parameters of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism between 18-month old male dwarf (N=6) and wild type (N=5) mice. The specific activity of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was significantly elevated (205%, p<0.0001) in the dwarf mice, as were GENENOTIN (50%, p<0.01), GENENOTIN (83%, p<0.001), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, 91%, p<0.001) activities. Even though the activities of GENEIN and GENEIN were elevated, the concentration of liver CHEMICALIN was decreased (24%, p<0.001) and CHEMICALIN increased (113%, p<0.001) in the dwarf mice. These data indicate that dwarf mice, compared to wild type mice, have a markedly different metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN. Altered CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism may partially explain earlier reports indicating less oxidative damage to proteins in dwarf mice. Taken together, the data suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism may play a role in oxidative defense in the dwarf mouse and should be studied as a potential mechanism of extended lifespan.
22705396	The potential of nicotinic enhancement of cognitive remediation training in schizophrenia. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are critically important predictors of long-term psychosocial outcome and are not significantly ameliorated by currently available medications. Cognitive remediation training has shown promise for alleviating cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, but the clinical significance has often been limited by small effect sizes. Approaches that achieve larger improvement involve time requirements that can be cost-prohibitive within the current clinical care system. This mini-review evaluates the theoretical potential of a pharmacological enhancement strategy of cognitive remediation training with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonists. nAChR agonists can facilitate sensory processing, alertness, attention, learning and memory. While these effects may be too subtle and short-lasting to be of clinical relevance as a primary treatment of cognitive deficits, they constitute an ideal effects profile for enhancing training benefits. Several mechanisms are described through which repeated coupling of cognitive training challenges with nAChR stimulation may enhance and accelerate cognitive remediation training effects, advancing such interventions into more effective and practicable treatments of some of the most debilitating symptoms of schizophrenia. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Cognitive Enhancers'.
14508322	Activation of GENEIN mediates the cardiovascular effects of CHEMICALIN. BACKGROUND: The intravenous anesthetic CHEMICALNOTIN exhibits structural similarities to specific GENEIN agonists of the type such as CHEMICALIN. The current study was performed to elucidate the possible interaction of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN in mice lacking individual GENEIN subtypes (alpha2-KO). METHODS: Sedative and cardiovascular responses to CHEMICALIN and the alpha2-agonist, CHEMICALIN, were determined in mice deficient in GENEIN subtypes. Inhibition of binding of the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN to recombinant GENEIN by CHEMICALIN was tested in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells in vitro. RESULTS: In vivo, loss and recovery of the righting reflex required similar times after intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICALIN in wild-type and in GENEIN-deficient mice, indicating that the hypnotic effect of CHEMICALIN in mice does not require the GENEIN subtype. Intravenous injection of CHEMICALNOTIN resulted in a transient increase (duration 2.4 +/- 0.2 min) in arterial blood pressure in wild-type mice (17 +/- 3 mmHg). CHEMICALNOTIN did not affect blood pressure in alpha2B-KO or alpha2AB-KO mice. In membranes from HEK293 cells transfected with GENEIN, CHEMICALIN inhibited binding of the alpha2-antagonist, CHEMICALIN, with higher potency from GENEIN than from GENEIN (Ki alpha2A 208 microm, alpha2B 26 microm, alpha2C 56 microm). In GENEIN-expressing HEK293 cells, CHEMICALIN rapidly increased phosphorylation of the GENEIN GENEIN. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that CHEMICALIN acts as an agonist at GENEIN, which appears in vivo primarily as an GENEIN-mediated increase in blood pressure. This effect of CHEMICALNOTIN may contribute to the cardiovascular stability of patients after induction of anesthesia with CHEMICALNOTIN.
23315277	CHEMICALNOTIN nanoparticles-induced cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis in cultured A431 and A549 cells. In medicine, the use of CHEMICALNOTIN nanoparticles (CHEMICALNOTIN NPs) offers new perspectives in biosensor, drug delivery and cancer therapy. However, questions about potential toxic and deleterious effects of CHEMICALNOTIN NPs have also been raised. The aim of this study was to investigate the induction of cytotoxicity, oxidative stress and apoptosis by CHEMICALNOTIN NPs (size 15Â nm) in human skin epithelial (A431) and human lung epithelial (A549) cells. CHEMICALNOTIN NPs (concentration range 25-200Â Âµg/ml) induced dose-dependent cytotoxicity in both types of cells, which was demonstrated by cell viability (CHEMICALNOTIN) and GENENOTIN leakage assays. CHEMICALNOTIN NPs were also found to induce oxidative stress in a dose-dependent manner, indicated by depletion of CHEMICALNOTIN and induction of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) generation and lipid peroxidation. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that following the exposure of cells to CHEMICALIN NPs, the messenger RNA level of apoptotic genes (GENEIN and GENEIN) were upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, activities of GENEIN and GENEIN enzymes were also significantly higher in both kinds of cells exposed to CHEMICALIN NPs. This study suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN NPs induce cytotoxicity and apoptosis in A431 and A549 cells, which is likely to be mediated through ROS generation and oxidative stress.
23550066	The GENEIN Allele Significantly Alters the N-demethylation of CHEMICALIN Enantiomers In Vitro. CHEMICALIN is primarily metabolized to CHEMICALNOTIN by hepatic GENEIN and GENEIN-mediated N-demethylation. However, the relative contribution from each enzyme remains controversial. The GENEIN allele is associated with reduced enzyme expression and activity that may lead to interindividual variability in CHEMICALIN metabolism. We examined the N-demethylation of individual CHEMICALIN enantiomers using human liver microsomes (HLMs) genotyped for the GENEIN allele, insect cell expressed recombinant GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN enzymes and COS-1 cell expressed recombinant GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein variant. Effects of GENENOTIN-selective inhibitors on CHEMICALNOTIN formation were also determined in HLMs. The two-enzyme Michaelis-Menten model best fitted the HLM kinetic data. The Km value for the high affinity enzyme and the low affinity enzyme were similar to those for the expressed GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively. The intrinsic clearance for both CHEMICALIN enantiomers by the high affinity enzyme in HLMs with GENEIN/*1 genotype were at least 2-fold and 6-fold higher, respectively, than those for GENENOTIN/*6 genotype and GENENOTIN/*6 genotype. The Vmax and Km values for GENENOTIN were approximately 160% and 70% of those for GENENOTIN, respectively. CHEMICALIN (GENEIN inhibitor, 25 Î¼M) and the monoclonal antibody against GENENOTIN but not CHEMICALIN (GENEIN inhibitor, 25 Î¼M) or the monoclonal antibody against GENENOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN N-demethylation at clinically relevant concentrations. The degree of inhibition was significantly reduced in HLMs with the GENENOTIN allele (gene-dose P<0.05). These results indicate a major role of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN N-demethylation in vitro and a significant impact of the GENEIN allele on enzyme-CHEMICALIN binding and catalytic activity.
23572528	A Role for GENENOTIN in the Activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN Recruitment. Membrane traffic requires the specific concentration of GENENOTIN and exclusion of other proteins into nascent carriers. Critical components of this selectivity are the GENENOTIN that bind to short, linear motifs in the cytoplasmic tails of transmembrane GENENOTIN and sequester them into nascent carriers. The recruitment of the adaptors is mediated by activated GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN complexes mark sites of carrier formation. However, the nature of the signal(s) that initiate carrier biogenesis remains unknown. We examined the specificity and initial sites of recruitment of GENENOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) in response to the Golgi or endosomal localization of specific GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN lacking a CHEMICALIN-terminal domain GENEIN). We find that GENENOTIN promotes the recruitment of specific GENENOTIN, suggesting that it is part of an upstream signaling event. GENENOTIN do not promote GENENOTIN recruitment to all compartments in which they reside and thus additional factors regulate the GENENOTIN ability to promote GENENOTIN activation and GENENOTIN recruitment. We document that within a given compartment different GENENOTIN recruit different GENENOTIN suggesting that there is little or no free, activated GENENOTIN at the membrane and that GENENOTIN activation is spatially and temporally coupled to the GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN. Using temperature block, CHEMICALNOTIN, and recovery from each, we found that the cytoplasmic tail of GENENOTIN causes the recruitment of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN to recycling endosomes and not at the Golgi, as predicted by steady state staining profiles. These results are discussed with respect to the generation of novel models for GENENOTIN-dependent regulation of membrane traffic.
11792932	GENENOTIN inhibitors for male infertility. PURPOSE: CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratio levels in infertile men improve during treatment with the GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, and resulting changes in semen parameters. We evaluated the effect of CHEMICALIN, a more selective GENEIN inhibitor, on the hormonal and semen profiles of infertile men with abnormal baseline CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 140 subfertile men with abnormal CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios were treated with 100 to 200 mg. CHEMICALNOTIN daily or 1 mg. CHEMICALNOTIN daily. Changes in CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios and semen parameters were evaluated during therapy. The effect of obesity, diagnosis of the Klinefelter syndrome, and presence of varicocele and/or history of varicocele repair on treatment results was studied. RESULTS: Men treated with CHEMICALNOTIN had an increase in CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios during therapy (mean plus or minus standard error of the mean 5.3 +/- 0.2 versus 12.4 +/- 1.1, p <0.001). This change was confirmed in subgroups of men with the Klinefelter syndrome, a history of varicocele repair and those with varicocele. A total of 12 oligospermic men had semen analysis before and during CHEMICALNOTIN treatment with an increase in sperm concentration (5.5 versus 11.2 million sperm per ml., p <0.01), motility (14.7% versus 21.0%, p <0.05), morphology (6.5% versus 12.8%, p = 0.05), and motility index (606.3 versus 1685.2 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.05) appreciated. During CHEMICALNOTIN treatment, similar changes in the CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios were seen (7.2 +/- 0.3 versus 18.1 +/- 1.0, respectively, p <0.001). This improvement of hormonal parameters was noted for all subgroups except those patients with the Klinefelter syndrome. A total of 25 oligospermic men with semen analysis before and during CHEMICALNOTIN treatment had an increase in semen volume (2.9 versus 3.5 ml., p <0.05), sperm concentration (5.5 versus 15.6 million sperm per ml., p <0.001) and motility index (832.8 versus 2930.8 million motile sperm per ejaculate, respectively, p <0.005). These changes were similar to those observed in men treated with CHEMICALNOTIN. No significant difference in serum CHEMICALNOTIN levels during treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was observed. However, the CHEMICALNOTIN treatment group did have a statistically better improvement of serum CHEMICALNOTIN concentration and CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios (p <0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Men who are infertile with a low serum CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratio can be treated with an GENENOTIN inhibitor. With treatment, an increase in CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratio occurred in association with increased semen parameters. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN have similar effects on hormonal profiles and semen analysis. CHEMICALNOTIN appears to be at least as effective as CHEMICALNOTIN for treating men with abnormal CHEMICALNOTIN-to-CHEMICALNOTIN ratios, except for the subset with the Klinefelter syndrome, who appeared to be more effectively treated with CHEMICALNOTIN.
23043184	Interactions between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN: effects on affinity for GENENOTIN and substrate metabolism. Studies in microsomal and reconstituted systems have shown that the presence of one GENENOTIN isoform can significantly influence the catalytic activity of another isoform. In this study, we assessed whether GENENOTIN could influence the catalytic activity of GENENOTIN under steady-state turnover conditions. The results show that GENENOTIN inhibits GENEIN-mediated metabolism of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) with a K(i) of 0.04 ÂµM. However, GENENOTIN is not an inhibitor of GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN hydroxylation. When these inhibition studies were performed with the artificial oxidant CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN did not significantly inhibit GENENOTIN activity. Determinations of the apparent K(M) and k(cat) of GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN in the presence of increasing concentrations of GENENOTIN revealed a mixed inhibition of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN. At low concentrations of GENENOTIN, the apparent K(M) of GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN increased up to 23-fold with virtually no change in the k(cat) for the reaction, however, at higher concentrations of GENENOTIN1, the apparent K(M) of GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN decreased to levels similar to those observed in the absence of GENENOTIN and the k(cat) also decreased by 11-fold. Additionally, GENENOTIN increased the apparent K(M) of GENEIN for CHEMICALIN by 8-fold and the apparent K(M) did not decrease to its original value when saturating concentrations of GENENOTIN were used. While the individual apparent K(M) values of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN are similar, the apparent K(M) of GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN in the presence of GENENOTIN decreased significantly, thus suggesting that GENENOTIN enhances the affinity of GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN and this may allow GENENOTIN to out-compete GENENOTIN for GENENOTIN.
23643748	Prosocial effects of oxytocin in two mouse models of autism spectrum disorders. Clinical evidence suggests that oxytocin treatment improves social deficits and repetitive behavior in autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, the neuropeptide has a short plasma half-life and poor ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. In order to facilitate the development of more bioavailable oxytocinergic compounds as therapeutics to treat core ASD symptoms, small animal models must be validated for preclinical screens. This study examined the preclinical utility of two inbred mouse strains, BALB/cByJ and C58/J, that exhibit phenotypes relevant to core ASD symptoms. Mice from both strains were intraperitoneally administered oxytocin, using either acute or sub-chronic regimens. Acute oxytocin did not increase sociability in BALB/cByJ; however, sub-chronic oxytocin had significant prosocial effects in both BALB/cByJ and C58/J. Increased sociability was observed 24 hours following the final oxytocin dose in BALB/cByJ, while prosocial effects of oxytocin emerged 1-2 weeks post-treatment in C58/J. Furthermore, acute oxytocin decreased motor stereotypy in C58/J and did not induce hypoactivity or anxiolytic-like effects in an open field test. This study demonstrates that oxytocin administration can attenuate social deficits and repetitive behavior in mouse models of ASD, dependent on dose regimen and genotype. These findings provide validation of the BALB/cByJ and C58/J models as useful platforms for screening novel drugs for intervention in ASDs and for elucidating the mechanisms contributing to the prosocial effects of oxytocin.
15336276	Probing for a hydrophobic a binding register in GENEIN with CHEMICALIN. To explore for the existence of an auxiliary hydrophobic binding register remote from the active site of GENENOTIN a series of CHEMICALIN derivatives of CHEMICALIN were synthesized and evaluated for their inhibitory potencies against GENEIN. Both the CHEMICALNOTIN (1a and 1b) exhibited only modest inhibitory potency against. The CHEMICALNOTIN analog 1c was intermediate in inhibitory potency while inhibitors possessing a longer CHEMICALNOTIN tether from the phenyl ring, resulted in markedly improved K(i) values. The greatest inhibitory potency was obtained for the inhibitors in which the phenyl ring was extended furthest from the central CHEMICALNOTIN (1f, n=5 and 1g, n=6). The slightly serrated pattern that emerged as the CHEMICALNOTIN tether increased from three to six methylene units suggests that inhibitory potency is not simply correlated to increased hydrophobicity imparted by the CHEMICALNOTIN chain, but rather that one or more hydrophobic binding registers may exist remote from the substrate recognition architecture in the active site of GENENOTIN.
23174754	Deficits in male sexual behavior in adulthood after social instability stress in adolescence in rats. There is increasing evidence that exposure to stressors in adolescence has long-lasting effects on emotional and cognitive behavior, but little is known as to whether reproductive functions are affected. We investigated appetitive and consummatory aspects of sexual behavior in male rats that were exposed to chronic social instability stress (SS, n=24) for 16 days in mid-adolescence compared to control rats (CTL, n=24). Over five sexual behavior test sessions with a receptive female, SS rats made fewer ejaculations (p=0.02) and had longer latencies to ejaculation (p=0.03). When only data from rats that ejaculated in the fifth session were analyzed, SS rats (n=18) had reduced copulatory efficiency (more mounts and intromissions before ejaculation) compared to CTL rats (n=19) (p=0.004), and CTL rats were twice as likely as SS rats to make more than one ejaculation in the fifth session (p=0.05). Further, more CTL (14/24) than SS (5/25) rats ejaculated in four or more sessions (p=0.05). SS rats had lower plasma testosterone concentrations than CTL rats (p=0.05), but did not differ in androgen receptor, estrogen receptor alpha, or Fos immunoreactive cell counts in the medial preoptic area. The groups did not differ in a partner preference test administered between the fourth and fifth sexual behavior session. The results suggest that developmental history contributes to individual differences in reproductive behavior, and that stress exposures in adolescence may be a factor in sexual sluggishness.
23551329	Low-Dose CHEMICALNOTIN Treatment Promotes Pro-Survival Signalling Pathway In Adult Rat Prefrontal Cortex. Synthetic glucocorticoid CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a highly potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent, is widely used in treatments of brain cancer, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The objective of the current study was to determine whether a low-dose subchronic CHEMICALNOTIN treatment (100 Î¼g/kg for 8 consecutive days) exerts long-term effects on apoptosis in the adult rat prefrontal cortex (PFC) by examining the expression of cell death-promoting molecules (GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, cleaved GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) and cell-survival molecules (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN). Our results revealed that body, thymus and adrenal weight as well CHEMICALNOTIN level in the serum and PFC were reduced a day following last CHEMICALNOTIN injection. In PFC, CHEMICALIN caused activation of GENEIN, augmentation of pro-survival GENEIN protein and enhanced GENEIN/GENEIN protein ratio, as well GENEIN translocation to mitochondria. The unaltered profile in the protein expression of apoptotic molecules GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN was detected, while the GENENOTIN protein was decreased. Results of RT-PCR analysis showed decrease of GENEIN mRNA level and no significant difference in GENEIN and GENEIN mRNA expressions in CHEMICALIN-treated rats. Finally, the DNA fragmentation assay and Fluoro-Jade staining demonstrated no considerable changes in the apoptosis in rat PFC. Our findings support the concept that a low-dose CHEMICALNOTIN creates the hypocorticoid state in the brain and indicate that subchronic CHEMICALNOTIN treatment activates pro-survival signalling pathway but does not change apoptotic markers in rat PFC.

16477002	Crystal structure of the GENENOTIN signaling complex: paradigm for a heterotrimeric GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is a GENENOTIN that functions as a growth factor and central regulator in the immune system and mediates its effects through ligand-induced hetero-trimerization of the receptor subunits GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN. Here, we describe the crystal structure of the trimeric assembly of the GENENOTIN ectodomains in complex with GENENOTIN at 3.0 A resolution. The quaternary structure is consistent with a stepwise assembly from GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN subunit forms the largest of the three GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interfaces, which, together with the high abundance of charge-charge interactions, correlates well with the rapid association rate and high-affinity interaction of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN at the cell surface. Surprisingly, GENENOTIN makes no contacts with GENENOTIN, and only minor changes are observed in the GENENOTIN structure in response to receptor binding. These findings support the principal role of GENENOTIN to deliver GENENOTIN to the signaling complex and act as regulator of signal transduction. Cooperativity in assembly of the final quaternary complex is easily explained by the extraordinarily extensive set of interfaces found within the fully assembled GENENOTIN signaling complex, which nearly span the entire length of the GENENOTIN subunits. Helix A of GENENOTIN wedges tightly between GENENOTIN to form a three-way junction that coalesces into a composite binding site for the final gamma(c) recruitment. The GENEIN/gamma(c) interface itself exhibits the smallest buried surface and the fewest CHEMICALIN bonds in the complex, which is consistent with its promiscuous use in other GENENOTIN complexes.
17205056	Antitumor activity of CHEMICALIN in GENEIN-driven leukemic cells. Activating internal tandem duplication (ITD) insertions in the GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN are found in about one fourth of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and have been shown to be an independent negative prognostic factor for survival. We show that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) potently inhibits GENEIN enzymatic and signaling activities. In HEK293 cells stably transfected with GENENOTIN-WT or GENENOTIN-ITD, CHEMICALIN blocked basal and ligand dependent GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN autophosphorylation as well as GENEIN and GENEIN phosphorylation. In leukemia cell lines MV4-11 and EOL-1, CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in decreased cell proliferation and inhibition of GENEIN signaling. The growth of the GENEIN-independent RS4-11 cell line was only weakly inhibited by CHEMICALIN. Cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis were observed upon treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN in MV4-11 and EOL-1 cells. The antitumor efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN was evaluated against the MV4-11 leukemia grown subcutaneously in NCr nu/nu mice. Doses of 3 and 10 mg/kg administered orally for 14 days resulted in six and nine out of 10 animals with complete responses, respectively. The demonstration that CHEMICALIN exhibits potent target inhibition and efficacy in GENEIN-driven models suggests that this compound may have a therapeutic benefit for patients with GENEIN-driven leukemias.
23041257	Apoptosis induced neurotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN via mitochondria-mediated pathway in PC12 cells. The severe toxicity of antitumor CHEMICALNOTIN compounds limits their application in clinic, however, the toxic mechanism is still unclear. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), an antitumor agent with high activity and obvious neurotoxicity was chosen as a typical CHEMICALNOTIN compound to investigate its neurotoxic mechanism using PC12 cells and comprehensive methods. Treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN resulted in a dose- and time-dependent growth inhibition of PC12 cells. The changes in cell morphology were observed using light microscopy, fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. PC12 cell apoptosis induced by CHEMICALIN was confirmed by annexin V/CHEMICALNOTIN staining, and characterized by cleavage of GENEIN and GENEIN proteins. CHEMICALIN induced the release of GENEIN from the mitochondria to the cytosol and the generation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species. CHEMICALIN up-regulated the expression of GENEIN, down-regulated the expression of GENEIN, and significantly increased the ratio of GENEIN/GENEIN. CHEMICALIN also caused the phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN(GENEIN). In rats exposed to CHEMICALIN, apoptosis was also observed in brain, as shown by the detection of cleaved GENEIN and GENEIN proteins and increased TUNEL positive staining. In conclusion, the results demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN caused the neurotoxicity by inducing apoptosis via mitochondria-mediated pathway.
12927775	Structure-based design of CHEMICALIN, a novel orally effective GENEIN inhibitor. Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure, the leading causes of death in the Western world. Inhibitors of the GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN system (RAS) have proven to be successful treatments for hypertension. As GENENOTIN specifically catalyses the rate-limiting step of the RAS, it represents the optimal target for RAS inhibition. Several peptide-like GENENOTIN inhibitors have been synthesized previously, but poor pharmacokinetic properties meant that these compounds were not clinically useful. We employed a combination of molecular modelling and crystallographic structure analysis to design GENENOTIN inhibitors lacking the extended peptide-like backbone of earlier inhibitors, for improved pharmacokinetic properties. This led to the discovery of CHEMICALIN, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of GENEIN in vitro, and in vivo; once-daily oral doses of CHEMICALIN inhibit GENEIN and lower blood pressure in CHEMICALNOTIN-depleted marmosets and hypertensive human patients. CHEMICALIN represents the first in a novel class of GENEIN inhibitors with the potential for treatment of hypertension and related cardiovascular diseases.
16774921	Functional divergence of a unique CHEMICALIN-terminal domain of GENEIN to accommodate its splicing and aminoacylation roles. GENEIN (GENENOTIN) performs dual essential roles in group I intron RNA splicing as well as protein synthesis within the yeast mitochondria. Deletions of the CHEMICALNOTIN terminus differentially impact the two functions of the enzyme in splicing and aminoacylation in vivo. Herein, we determined that a CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALIN-terminal deletion of GENEIN, which does not complement a null strain, can form a ternary complex with the bI4 intron and its maturase splicing partner. However, the complex fails to stimulate splicing activity. The x-ray co-crystal structure of GENENOTIN showed that a CHEMICALIN-terminal extension of about 60 CHEMICALIN forms a discrete domain, which is unique among the GENEIN and interacts with the corner of the L-shaped tRNALeu. Interestingly, deletion of the entire GENEIN CHEMICALIN-terminal domain enhanced its aminoacylation and CHEMICALIN editing activities. In striking contrast, deletion of the corresponding CHEMICALIN-terminal domain of GENEIN abolished aminoacylation of tRNALeu and also CHEMICALIN editing of mischarged tRNA molecules. These results suggest that the role of the CHEMICALNOTIN-specific CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal domain in tRNA recognition for aminoacylation and CHEMICALNOTIN editing has adapted differentially and with surprisingly opposite effects. We propose that the secondary role of GENEIN in RNA splicing has impacted the functional evolution of this critical CHEMICALIN-terminal domain.
20531964	CHEMICALNOTIN: the first approved product for patients with advanced renal cell cancer after CHEMICALNOTIN and/or CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is the first oral inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN) to reach the oncology clinic. CHEMICALNOTIN 10 mg daily achieves complete inhibition of its target at below the maximum tolerable dose for most patients. A phase III randomized placebo-controlled trial has examined the impact of CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with clear cell renal cancers and progressive disease on or within 6 months of the GENEIN GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and/or CHEMICALIN. The primary endpoint of progression-free survival was increased from median 1.9 to 4.9 months (hazard ratio 0.33, P < 0.001) and 25% were still progression-free after 10 months of CHEMICALNOTIN therapy. There was a delay in time to decline of performance status and trends to improvement in quality of life, disease-related symptoms, and overall survival despite crossover of the majority of patients assigned to placebo. In 2009, CHEMICALNOTIN was approved in the US and Europe as the only validated option for this indication. Toxicities are usually mild to moderate and can be managed with dose reduction or interruption if necessary. Opportunistic infections and non-infectious pneumonitis are seen as a class effect. Management of common practical management issues are discussed. Clinical trials are in progress to examine additional roles for CHEMICALNOTIN in renal cancer, alone and in combination with other agents.
23361587	Anti-aging molecule, Sirt1: a novel therapeutic target for diabetic nephropathy. Caloric restriction prolongs the lifespan of many species. Therefore, investigators have researched the usefulness of caloric restriction for healthy lifespan extension. Sirt1, an NAD(+)-dependent deacetylase, was identified as a molecule necessary for caloric restriction-related anti-aging strategies. Sirt1 functions as an intracellular energy sensor to detect the concentration of NAD(+), and controls in vivo metabolic changes under caloric restriction and starvation through its deacetylase activity to many targets including histones, nuclear transcriptional factors, and enzymes. During the past decade, investigators have reported the relationship between disturbance of Sirt1 activation and the onset of aging- and obesity-associated diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Consequently, a calorie restriction-mimetic action of Sirt1 is now expected as a new therapy for these diseases. In addition, recent studies have gradually clarified the role of Sirt1 in the onset of kidney disease. Its activation may also become a new target of treatment in the patients with chronic kidney disease including diabetic nephropathy. In this article, we would like to review the role of Sirt1 in the onset of kidney disease based on previous studies, and discuss its possibility as the target of treatment in diabetic nephropathy.
7948825	CHEMICALNOTIN: the Bangkok review. CHEMICALNOTIN is a site-protective ulcer healing drug with a remarkable range of mechanisms of action. Recent studies highlight the capacity of CHEMICALIN to bind GENEIN (GENEIN) and deliver it in high concentration to the ulcer. GENENOTIN stimulates the production of granulation tissue, angiogenesis and re-epithelization, thus improving the quality of ulcer healing. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in reducing parietal cell sensitivity may be another factor important in the lower relapse rate demonstrated after duodenal ulcer healing. CHEMICALNOTIN has been demonstrated to be efficacious in healing both duodenal and gastric ulcers together with mild oesophagitis, and it is safe for both short-term use and maintenance. In stress ulcer prophylaxis it is as effective as acid suppression or neutralization and has the advantage of lesser rates of nosocomial pneumonia than are demonstrated with antacids or H2 antagonists. The potential advantages of CHEMICALNOTIN lie in the better quality of ulcer healing associated with longer duration of remission.
23535327	Synthesis and structure-activity relationship of CHEMICALIN derivatives as potent and selective GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors: Part 2. Synthesis and structure-activity relationships of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives with modification at C1 and 11 are described. Regioselective mono-deprotection of CHEMICALNOTIN was critical in their synthesis.
1680855	Involvement of GENENOTIN-sensitive GENENOTIN in the hormonal inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN currents in an GENENOTIN-secreting cell line (RINm5F). CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN secretion via pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanisms. Since voltage-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN currents play a key role in GENENOTIN secretion, we examined whether CHEMICALNOTIN modulates voltage-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN currents of the rat insulinoma cell line, RINm5F. In the whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique, CHEMICALNOTIN- but not omega-conotoxin-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN currents were identified. CHEMICALIN via GENEIN inhibited the CHEMICALNOTIN currents by about 50%. CHEMICALIN which also inhibits GENEIN secretion was less efficient (inhibition by 20%). The hormonal inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN currents was not affected by intracellularly applied CHEMICALNOTIN but blocked by the intracellularly applied CHEMICALNOTIN analog CHEMICALNOTIN and by pretreatment of cells with GENENOTIN. In contrast to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, GENENOTIN, another inhibitor of GENEIN secretion, reduced CHEMICALNOTIN currents by about 40% in a GENENOTIN-insensitive manner. Immunoblot experiments performed with antibodies generated against synthetic peptides revealed that membranes of RINm5F cells possess four GENENOTIN-sensitive GENENOTIN including GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and another GENENOTIN subtype, most likely representing GENENOTIN. In membranes of control but not of GENENOTIN-treated cells, CHEMICALIN via GENEIN stimulated incorporation of the photo-reactive CHEMICALNOTIN analog CHEMICALNOTIN into pertussis toxin substrates comigrating with the alpha-subunits of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and the not further identified GENENOTIN subtype. The present findings indicate that activated GENENOTIN of RINm5F cells interact with multiple GENENOTIN, i.e. two forms of GENENOTIN and with GENENOTIN. These GENEIN are likely to be involved in the CHEMICALIN-induced inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive CHEMICALNOTIN currents and in other signal transduction pathways contributing to the CHEMICALIN-induced inhibition of GENEIN secretion.
23532918	Synthesis and in Vitro Characterisation of CHEMICALIN-Based CHEMICALIN Conjugates as GENEIN/GENEIN GENEIN Antagonists. GENENOTIN-containing GENENOTIN are involved in many important physiological functions and play a pivotal role in mediating pain as well as in several neurodegenerative disorders. We aimed to develop fluorescent probes to target the GENENOTIN subunit selectively in order to allow better understanding of the relationships between receptor localisation and physiological importance. CHEMICALIN, known as the GENEIN antagonist of reference, was chosen as the template for the elaboration of probes. We had previously reported a CHEMICALIN conjugate that was shown (by confocal microscopy imaging of DS-red-labelled cortical neurons) to bind specifically to GENEIN. To elaborate this probe, we explored the influence of both the nature and the attachment point of the spacer between the fluorophore and the parent compound, CHEMICALNOTIN. We performed chemical modifications of CHEMICALNOTIN at the CHEMICALNOTIN position and on the CHEMICALNOTIN ring by introducing CHEMICALNOTIN functions and evaluated alkyl chains from two to 20 bonds either including or not including CHEMICALNOTIN functions as spacers. The previously developed probe was found to display the greatest activity in the inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced CHEMICALNOTIN influx by CHEMICALNOTIN imaging experiments on HEK293 cells transfected with the cDNA encoding for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Further investigations revealed that this probe had a neuroprotective effect equivalent to that of CHEMICALNOTIN in a standard test for neurotoxicity. Despite effects of lesser amplitude with these probes relative to CHEMICALNOTIN, we demonstrated that they displaced CHEMICALNOTIN in mouse brain slices in a similar manner.
11034389	Conformational epitopes on the diabetes autoantigen GENENOTIN identified by peptide phage display and molecular modeling. The GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), contains a region of sequence similarity, including six identical residues CHEMICALNOTIN, to the GENENOTIN of coxsackie B virus, suggesting that cross-reactivity between coxsackie B virus and GENENOTIN can initiate autoimmune diabetes. We used the human islet cell mAbs MICA3 and MICA4 to identify the Ab epitopes of GENENOTIN by screening phage-displayed random peptide libraries. The identified peptide sequences could be mapped to a homology model of the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN. For MICA3, a surface loop containing the sequence CHEMICALNOTIN and two adjacent exposed helixes were identified in the GENENOTIN as well as a region of the CHEMICALIN terminus of GENEIN that has previously been identified as critical for MICA3 binding. To confirm that the loop containing the CHEMICALNOTIN sequence contributes to the MICA3 epitope, this loop was deleted by mutagenesis. This reduced binding of MICA3 by 70%. Peptide sequences selected using MICA4 were rich in basic or CHEMICALNOTIN-containing CHEMICALIN, and the surface of the GENEIN surrounding Lys358, which is known to be critical for MICA4 binding, was likewise rich in these CHEMICALIN. Also, the two phage most reactive with MICA4 encoded the motif GENENOTIN, and the reverse of this sequence, CHEMICALNOTIN, was located in this same region. Thus, we have defined the MICA3 and MICA4 epitopes on GENENOTIN using the combination of phage display, molecular modeling, and mutagenesis and have provided compelling evidence for the involvement of the CHEMICALNOTIN loop in the MICA3 epitope.
17434872	Molecular determinants for the selective inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN is the first example of a marketed GENEIN inhibitor of the CHEMICALIN class, and it is reported to be the most selective COXIB in vivo. However, the molecular basis of its GENENOTIN inhibition has not been completely defined. Using standard assays, CHEMICALIN was found to be a poor inhibitor of purified GENEIN and a relatively weak inhibitor of purified GENEIN. The extent of GENENOTIN inhibition plateaued at around 50% and suggested that the inhibitor may be reversibly bound to the enzyme. Kinetic studies with CHEMICALIN demonstrated that it was a time-dependent and slowly reversible inhibitor of GENEIN that exhibited at least two binding steps during inhibition. Derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN were synthesized with or without the CHEMICALNOTIN group on the CHEMICALNOTIN ring and with various substitutions on the lower CHEMICALNOTIN ring. Inhibition studies demonstrated that the CHEMICALIN group on the CHEMICALIN ring is required for GENEIN selectivity. The chemical identity and position of the substituents on the lower CHEMICALIN ring were important in determining the potency and extent of GENEIN inhibition as well as GENEIN selectivity. Mutation of GENEIN or GENEIN abolished the potent inhibition observed with wild-type GENEIN and key CHEMICALIN analogs. Interestingly, a GENEIN mutant was inhibited with equal potency to GENEIN with CHEMICALIN-, CHEMICALIN-, or CHEMICALIN-substituted inhibitors and, in the case of CHEMICALIN, actually showed an increase in potency. Taken together with a recent crystal structure of a CHEMICALIN-GENEIN complex, the kinetic analyses presented herein of the inhibition of mutant GENEIN by CHEMICALIN allows the definition of the molecular basis of GENENOTIN inhibition.
15358979	Cerebral GENENOTIN occupancy in Schizophrenic patients treated with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. We report the results of a double-blind, randomized prospective trial on GENENOTIN occupancy and the clinical effects of CHEMICALNOTIN versus CHEMICALNOTIN in a sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic patients. Receptor occupancy was evaluated in different cortical areas and in basal ganglia using CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and positron emission tomography (PET). A total of 15 neuroleptic-free patients completed the study undergoing a baseline and a post-treatment PET scan (CHEMICALNOTIN, nine patients, one female; CHEMICALNOTIN, six patients, three female) 8 weeks after starting treatment. PET data were analysed both by regions of interest and on a voxel-by-voxel basis using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM96). CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN induced a similar and significant inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN binding index in the cortex. In the basal ganglia, receptor occupancy was significantly higher with CHEMICALNOTIN than with CHEMICALNOTIN (p=0.0018). By contrast, no differences in receptor occupancy were detected at the level of the pituitary gland. Clinical outcomes, in particular a full extra pyramidal tolerability, were similar. In this sample of neuroleptic-refractory schizophrenic patients, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN showed a different pattern of occupancy of GENEIN despite a common lack of extrapyramidal side-effects.
19429089	Inhibitory effect of selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors on the GENENOTIN. The GENEIN (GENEIN) is the target molecule of action of some psychostimulants, such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). The present study examined the effect of antidepressants, such as selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), on GENEIN activity by measuring CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALIN uptake into synaptic vesicles prepared from rat striatum. SSRIs, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, inhibited vesicular CHEMICALNOTIN uptake in vitro. The rank order of potency was CHEMICALNOTIN>>CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN>CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN>CHEMICALNOTIN. Moreover, kinetic analysis revealed that inhibition by CHEMICALIN, a typical GENEIN inhibitor, was uncompetitive, decreasing maximum velocity and affinity for CHEMICALIN. Inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN was noncompetitive, only decreasing maximum velocity for CHEMICALNOTIN. These results suggest that CHEMICALIN inhibited the activity of GENEIN by a mechanism different from that of CHEMICALIN and did not directly interact with the active site of GENEIN.
23411171	Anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous extract of Welsh onion green leaves in mice. The anti-inflammatory effects of an aqueous extract of Welsh onion green leaves (WOE) in mice was investigated. Administration of WOE, in the range of 0.25-1g/kg, showed a concentration dependent inhibition on paw edema development after carrageenan treatment in mice. The anti-inflammatory effects of WOE were closely attributed to decreased levels of tissue NO and tumor necrosis factor-Î± (TNF-Î±). Further evidence for WOE's protection is shown in the reduction of lipid oxidation and the increase of antioxidant enzyme activities, including catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in vivo. Further, WOE also decreased the number of acetic acid-induced writhing responses and formalin-induced pain in the late phase in mice. Overall, the results showed that WOE might serve as a natural source of anti-inflammatory compounds.
17408310	Application of the bradford hill criteria to assess the causality of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced arrhythmia: a model for assessing causal association in pharmacovigilance. INTRODUCTION: The Bradford Hill criteria are a widely used, useful tool for the assessment of biomedical causation. We have examined their application to pharmacovigilance using the example of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Reactions Weekly and regulatory websites to identify evidence for the association between CHEMICALNOTIN and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia that had been published in the English language. Two hundred and five publications were identified as being potentially suitable for the study. After excluding irrelevant articles, studies on high-risk populations and review articles, 70 publications were assessed using the Bradford Hill criteria. These included 24 case reports, case series or spontaneous report summaries; eight epidemiological studies; 22 clinical studies; and 16 experimental (in vivo and in vitro) publications. RESULTS: The most compelling evidence for an association between CHEMICALNOTIN use and QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia came from case/spontaneous reports and biological plausibility. Considering the rare incidence of serious cardiac events, these criteria formed the basis for the strength of the association. The number of reports from different populations showed consistency. Specificity was supported by clinical and cardiographic characterisation of the events. There were temporal relationships between the events and the initiation of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment, increases in the dosage and the receipt of interacting medications. The relationships between the adverse events and the latter two factors exhibited biological gradients. Experimental evidence could be found from biological models, as well as reports of positive dechallenge and/or rechallenge found in individual patients. CHEMICALIN was found to bind the GENEIN, which provides a plausible mechanism for QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia. Other QTc interval-prolonging/arrhythmic drugs that also bind to GENEIN provided an analogy for CHEMICALIN causing QTc interval prolongation/arrhythmia via this mechanism. The evidence provided by clinical studies was inconsistent, and epidemiological studies failed to demonstrate an association. Nevertheless, this did not prevent the assessment of causation. DISCUSSION: This study showed how different types of evidence found in pharmacovigilance can be evaluated using the Bradford Hill criteria. Further work is required to examine how the criteria can be applied to different types of adverse events and how they may be applied to pharmacovigilance.
10864881	CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist, reduces CHEMICALNOTIN influx into cortical synaptosomes by direct interaction with GENEIN: comparison with other GENEIN antagonists. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist used for the treatment of glaucoma, is known to be neuroprotective in paradigms of ischaemia/excitotoxicity. In this study, we examined whether CHEMICALIN and other GENEIN antagonists interact directly with neurotoxin binding to sites 1 and 2 of the GENEIN (GENEIN) in rat cerebrocortical synaptosomes. CHEMICALIN inhibited specific CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binding to GENEIN in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC(50) value of 9.8 microM. Comparison of all the GENEIN antagonists tested revealed a potency order of CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN approximately CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN approximately CHEMICALIN>/=CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN. None of the drugs caused a significant inhibition of CHEMICALIN binding to GENEIN, even at concentrations as high as 250 microM. Saturation experiments showed that CHEMICALNOTIN increased the K(D) of CHEMICALNOTIN binding but had no effect on the B(max). The association kinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN were unaffected by CHEMICALNOTIN, but the drug significantly accelerated the dissociation rate of the radioligand. These findings argue for a competitive, indirect, allosteric mode of inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN binding by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN influx in rat cortical synaptosomes with an IC(50) value of 28. 3 microM. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were significantly less effective than CHEMICALNOTIN at reducing CHEMICALNOTIN-evoked CHEMICALNOTIN influx. The ability of CHEMICALIN to interact with neurotoxin site 2 of the GENEIN and inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN influx may have a role in its neuroprotective action in paradigms of excitotoxicity/ischaemia and in its therapeutic effect in glaucoma.
23567953	Synthesis of novel 1,3,4-trisubstituted pyrazoles as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agents. Some novel 1,3,4-trisubstituted pyrazoles were synthesized and screened for their anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities as well as their ulcerogenic liability. They showed anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities with better GIT tolerance than the standard drug phenylbutazone. In addition, IC50 values for 5e and 8e were recorded. Compound 5e was found to be the most active one as anti-inflammatory and analgesic agent. On the other hand, COX-1/COX-2 isozyme selectivity was also done which showed equal inhibition to both isoforms.
22982445	CHEMICALIN induces cognitive impairment through enhancement of GENEIN-mediated GENEIN generation in mice. GENENOTIN plaques in the extracellular parenchyma mainly consist of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), one of the pathological hallmarks in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study, we examined neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, and memory performance following intracerebral infusions of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in mice. The results demonstrated that intracerebral infusions of CHEMICALIN (1 ng/mouse) produced memory impairment as determined by Morris water maze test and Y-maze test in mice, and caused the accumulation of GENEIN and GENEIN in the hippocampus and cortex through increased activity of Î²- and Î³-secretases accompanied with increased expression of GENEIN (GENEIN). CHEMICALIN also induced expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN GENEIN in the hippocampus and cortex. Pretreatment with CHEMICALIN (1.5 ng/mouse, intracerebroventricularly), a GENEIN antagonist, blocked CHEMICALIN-induced amyloidogenesis, memory deficits. CHEMICALNOTIN (0.6 Î¼M) also prevented CHEMICALNOTIN (20 nM)-induced amyloidogenesis in the cultured neurons in vitro. Moreover, CHEMICALIN-induced increases in GENEIN and GENEIN GENEIN in the brain were also attenuated by CHEMICALIN. These results suggest that CHEMICALIN increases GENEIN burden via activation of GENEIN, which further affects GENEIN levels and activity of Î²- and Î³-secretases via the GENEIN pathway. Our findings identify GENENOTIN signaling as a novel proinflammatory and proamyloidogenic pathway, and suggest a rationale for development of therapeutics targeting the GENENOTIN in neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.
20566645	Predicting cardiomyopathic phenotypes by altering CHEMICALIN affinity of GENEIN. Cardiac diseases associated with mutations in GENENOTIN subunits include hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). Altered calcium handling in these diseases is evidenced by changes in the CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity of contraction. Mutations in the CHEMICALIN sensor, GENEIN (GENEIN), were generated to increase/decrease the CHEMICALIN sensitivity of cardiac skinned fibers to create the characteristic effects of DCM, HCM, and RCM. We also used a reconstituted assay to determine the mutation effects on GENENOTIN activation and inhibition. One mutant (GENENOTIN) was found with HCM-like properties (increased CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity of force and normal levels of GENENOTIN inhibition). Three mutants (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) were identified with RCM-like properties (a large increase in CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity, partial loss of GENENOTIN inhibition, and increased basal force). Two mutations were identified (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) with DCM properties (decreased CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity, maximal force recovery, and activation of the GENENOTIN at high [CHEMICALNOTIN]). Steady-state fluorescence was utilized to assess CHEMICALIN affinity in isolated GENEIN containing GENEIN and did not necessarily mirror the fiber CHEMICALIN sensitivity. Circular dichroism of mutant GENEIN revealed a trend where increased alpha-helical content correlated with increased CHEMICALIN sensitivity in skinned fibers and vice versa. The main findings from this study were as follows: 1) GENEIN mutants demonstrated distinct functional phenotypes reminiscent of bona fide HCM, RCM, and DCM mutations; 2) a region in GENEIN associated with increased CHEMICALIN sensitivity in skinned fibers was identified; and 3) the GENENOTIN reporter mutation affected CHEMICALIN sensitivity, maximal force, and GENENOTIN activation of some mutants.
23033256	DNA methylation and histone modification profiles of mouse organic anion transporting polypeptides. Organic anion transporting polypeptides (rodents, Oatps; human, OATPs) are primarily involved in the transmembrane transportation of a wide range of endogenous and exogenous compounds. Multiple mouse Oatp1 isoforms are closely located on chromosome 6, where each isoform shows distinct tissue distribution; Oatp1b2, Oatp1a6, and Oatp1c1 are expressed exclusively in the liver, kidney, and cerebrum, respectively; Oatp1a1 in the liver and kidney; and Oatp1a4 in the liver and cerebrum. We have identified tissue-dependent differentially methylated region (T-DMR) around the transcriptional start site (TSS) of Oatp1b2, which correlates with its liver-specific expression. Bisulfite sequencing also demonstrated the presence of T-DMRs around the TSS in other Oatp1 genes: CpG dinucleotides at +149 relative to the TSS for Oatp1c1; -48, +101, and +356 for Oatp1a4; -572 and -550 for Oatp1a1; and -122 and +216 for Oatp1a6 were differentially methylated among the liver, kidney, and cerebrum. These methylation profiles were largely consistent with the tissue distribution of Oatp1 mRNAs. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay revealed that the mRNA expression of Oatp1 genes was accompanied by acetylated histone H3. Human OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 are located on chromosome 12p12 in the OATP1 cluster; both show predominant expression in the liver. These genes also contained T-DMRs that were hypomethylated in the liver, compared with kidney cortex: -511, -411, and +92 relative to the TSS for OATP1B1 and -331, +70, and +73 for OATP1B3. These results suggest that the difference in epigenetic profiles comprising DNA methylation and histone acetylation determines the distinct tissue distribution of Oatp/OATP mRNAs.
12387707	CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN), a selective CHEMICALNOTIN re-uptake inhibitor antidepressant which is the CHEMICALNOTIN, is in clinical development worldwide for the treatment of depression and anxiety disorders. Preclinical studies demonstrate that the therapeutic activity of CHEMICALNOTIN resides in the S-isomer and that CHEMICALIN binds with high affinity to the GENEIN. Conversely, CHEMICALNOTIN is approximately 30-fold less potent than CHEMICALNOTIN at this transporter. CHEMICALNOTIN has linear pharmacokinetics, so that plasma levels increase proportionately and predictably with increased doses and its half-life of 27 - 32 h is consistent with once-daily dosing. In addition, CHEMICALIN has negligible effects on GENEIN drug-metabolising enzymes in vitro, suggesting a low potential for drug-drug interactions. The efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN in patients with major depressive disorder has been demonstrated in multiple short-term, placebo-controlled clinical trials, three of which included CHEMICALNOTIN as an active control, as well as in a 36-week study evaluating efficacy in the prevention of depression relapse. In these studies, CHEMICALNOTIN was shown to have robust efficacy in the treatment of depression and associated symptoms of anxiety relative to placebo. Efficacy has also been shown in treating generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder. Results also suggest that, at comparable doses, CHEMICALNOTIN demonstrates clinically relevant and statistically significant superiority to placebo treatment earlier than CHEMICALNOTIN. Analysis of the safety database shows a low rate of discontinuation due to adverse events, and there was no statistically significant difference between CHEMICALNOTIN 10 mg/day and placebo in the proportion of patients who discontinued treatment early because of adverse events. The most common adverse events associated with CHEMICALNOTIN which occurred at a rate greater than placebo include nausea, insomnia, ejaculation disorder, diarrhoea, dry mouth and somnolence. Only nausea occurred in > 10% of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated patients.
18381445	CHEMICALIN increase GENEIN through inhibition of GENEIN activity and release of promoter-associated GENEIN. CHEMICALIN are GENEIN inhibitors broadly used for the control of hypercholesterolemia. Recently, they are reported to have beneficial effects on certain cancers. In this study, we show that statins inhibited the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity and increased the accumulation of GENENOTIN and the expression of GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) in human cancer cells. Computational modeling showed the direct interaction of the CHEMICALIN moiety of statins with the catalytic site of GENEIN. In the subsequent enzymatic assay, it was shown that CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN activity competitively with a K(i) value of 31.6 micromol/L. GENENOTIN but not GENENOTIN sites were found to be the GENENOTIN shown by GENENOTIN luciferase-promoter assays. DNA affinity protein binding assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed the dissociation of GENENOTIN and association of GENENOTIN, leading to the GENENOTIN acetylation on the GENENOTIN sites of GENENOTIN. In vitro cell proliferation and in vivo tumor growth were both inhibited by statins. These results suggest a novel mechanism for statins through abrogation of the GENENOTIN activity and promoter GENENOTIN acetylation to regulate GENENOTIN expression. Therefore, statins might serve as novel GENENOTIN inhibitors for cancer therapy and chemoprevention.
17049513	CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) enhances mature osteoclast apoptosis and suppresses osteoclast bone resorbing activity. Recent studies have reported that CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor that targets the intracellular GENEIN GENEIN-GENEIN and the GENEIN, is an effective inhibitor of the GENEIN, GENEIN. Given that GENEIN signalling through GENEIN plays an important role in osteoclast biology, we speculated that blocking such a pathway with CHEMICALIN may modulate osteoclast activity. Using a cell model of mature rabbit osteoclasts, we thus investigated the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on in vitro osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorbing activity. Our findings demonstrate that CHEMICALNOTIN dose-dependently stimulates osteoclast apoptosis, a phenomenon which is blocked by the GENENOTIN inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk. The ability of CHEMICALNOTIN to enhance osteoclast cell death was accompanied by a dose-dependent inhibition of osteoclast bone resorbing activity. CHEMICALIN was also found to inhibit GENEIN-induced osteoclast survival as well as GENEIN-induced osteoclast bone resorbing activity, but was without effect on GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN)-induced inhibition of osteoclasts apoptosis, further supporting the hypothesis that CHEMICALIN may affect mature osteoclasts through the inhibition of GENEIN. Taken together, these results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN could be of clinical value in treating diseases where bone destruction can occur due to excessive GENENOTIN production such as osteoporosis, inflammatory-and tumor-induced osteolysis.
10493852	Structural basis for GENEIN inhibition upon CHEMICALIN binding to the GENEIN. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) belongs to the family of GENENOTIN and plays an important role in T-cell activation and leukocyte migration to sites of inflammation. We report here that CHEMICALIN, a drug clinically used for lowering CHEMICALNOTIN levels, inhibits the interaction of GENEIN with its counter-receptor GENEIN. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography we show that the inhibitor binds to a highly conserved domain of the GENENOTIN called the GENENOTIN. The first three-dimensional structure of an GENENOTIN inhibitor bound to its receptor reveals atomic details for a hitherto unknown mode of GENENOTIN inhibition. It also sheds light into possible mechanisms of GENENOTIN mediated signalling and will support the design of novel anti-adhesive and immunosuppressive drugs.
23316965	Inhibition of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a potential strategy to ameliorate hypertension-induced cardiovascular alterations. A group of proteases, the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are well known for their capacity to degrade GENENOTIN. Particularly GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN contribute to the degradation and reorganization of the ECM components and are involved in the pathophysiology of cardiovascular remodeling. Imbalanced GENENOTIN activity promotes vascular smooth muscle cells and migration and proliferation and endothelial dysfunction, thus resulting in increased cardiovascular stiffness and hypertrophy. Furthermore, GENENOTIN cleaves non-ECM protein substrates including cellular receptors and intracellular proteins, thus causing cardiac and vascular dysfunction. It is now becoming clear that increased GENENOTIN activity promotes long-lasting cardiovascular structural and functional alterations in both experimental and clinical hypertension, and this alteration may contribute to sustained hypertension and its complications. Other pathogenic mechanisms including activation of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-aldosterone system and oxidative stress activate and upregulate GENENOTIN. Therefore, GENENOTIN inhibition may prevent the deleterious consequences of hypertension to the cardiovascular system. This review article will focus on growing evidence supporting the relevance of GENENOTIN in hypertension and the effects of GENENOTIN inhibitors. Particularly, the effects of CHEMICALIN used as a non selective GENEIN inhibitor in experimental and clinical studies will be discussed.
23339625	Time-dependent changes in hepatic and intestinal induction of GENEIN after administration of CHEMICALIN to rats. Abstract 1.âWe investigated the effects of the dose of and the number of times an inducer was administered and the duration of induction of hepatic and intestinal GENEIN (GENEIN) in rats using CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) as an inducer and a substrate to GENEIN, respectively. 2.âThe number of times CHEMICALNOTIN was administered was not a significant factor in the induction of either hepatic or intestinal GENENOTIN; however, administration of CHEMICALNOTIN multiple times markedly decreased the bioavailability of CHEMICALNOTIN by self-induction of GENENOTIN. 3.âGENEIN induction in the liver increased depending on the dose of CHEMICALIN, whereas that in intestine showed a mild increase, but the induction level was almost constant regardless of the dose of CHEMICALIN. 4.âAdministration of a single dose of CHEMICALIN showed a temporal increase in GENEIN activity in both tissues and the induction ratios reached maximum values at 12âh after CHEMICALIN administration. On the other hand, a mild increase of GENENOTIN activity, which lasted for at least 48âh, was observed in both tissues after administration of multiple doses. 5.âSome physiological compounds such as GENENOTIN might be involved in decreasing the GENENOTIN activity to maintain homeostasis of the body.
20226815	Autoradiographic study of GENENOTIN during memory formation. GENEIN (GENEIN) has been associated with drugs of abuse like CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). CHEMICALNOTIN is well known to produce effects on the CHEMICALNOTIN systems but it is unclear how CHEMICALIN affects GENEIN and memory. Here the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on autoshaping and novel object recognition (NOR) were investigated. Notably, both memory tasks recruit different behavioral, neural and cognitive demand. In autoshaping task a dose-response curve for CHEMICALNOTIN was determined. CHEMICALNOTIN (1.0mg/kg) impaired short-term memory (STM; lasting less of 90min) in NOR and impaired both STM and long-term memory (LTM; lasting 24 and 48h) in autoshaping, indicating that CHEMICALNOTIN had long-lasting effects in the latter task. A comparative autoradiography study of the relationship between the binding pattern of GENEIN in autoshaping new untrained vs. trained treated (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or both) animals was made. Considering that hemispheric dominance is important for LTM, hence right vs. left hemisphere of the brain was compared. Results showed that trained animals decreased cortical GENENOTIN binding relative to untrained ones. In untrained and trained treated animals with the amnesic dose (1.0mg/kg) of CHEMICALIN GENEIN binding in several areas including hippocampus and cortex decreased, more remarkably in the trained animals. In contrast, FLX improved memory, increased GENENOTIN binding, prevented the CHEMICALNOTIN amnesic effect and re-established the GENENOTIN binding. In general, memory and amnesia seemed to make GENENOTIN more vulnerable to drugs effects.
17275903	Hypoxia and CHEMICALNOTIN production in trophoblast cells. The etiology of preeclampsia is unknown but is thought to be related to hypoxia in the placenta. We previously reported that the enzyme GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has increased activity and gene expression in placentas from preeclamptic pregnancies [Tsoi SCM, Zheng J, Xu F, Kay HH. Differential expression of GENENOTIN isozymes (GENENOTIN) in human placenta with high expression of GENENOTIN isozyme in the endothelial cells of pre-eclampsia villi. Placenta 2001;22:317-22]. GENEIN is responsible for CHEMICALIN conversion to CHEMICALIN through glycolysis. In this study, we further investigated the role of hypoxia in primary trophoblast cells and a cultured cell line, JEG3 cells, to obtain a better understanding of how it affects the activities of GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN production and regulatory genes, as a possible model for preeclampsia. Primary trophoblast cells and JEG3 cells were cultured under 1% CHEMICALNOTIN. At 6, 12 and 24h, cells were analyzed for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN isozyme activities, mRNA and protein expression compared to standard culture conditions. CHEMICALNOTIN was measured from cell medium. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) protein expression was confirmed by western blot. Two GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) mRNA and protein expression were also studied under hypoxia. Finally, CHEMICALNOTIN was measured in plasma obtained from patients with severe preeclampsia. Under hypoxic conditions, GENENOTIN mRNA is increased in primary trophoblast cells and JEG3 cells. The GENENOTIN protein expression is higher in hypoxia-treated JEG3 cells than control. GENENOTIN isozyme activity and its protein expression are increased most significantly at 24h of culture under hypoxia. However, GENENOTIN protein is unchanged while its mRNA is decreased. CHEMICALNOTIN secretion from JEG3 cells under hypoxia is increased, as is the CHEMICALNOTIN levels in the plasma from preeclampsia patients. Of the two CHEMICALNOTIN transporters studied, GENENOTIN mRNA and protein level are increased under hypoxia. Our findings support the role of hypoxia in inducing GENENOTIN activity in trophoblasts and increasing GENENOTIN transcription as well as its activity. Higher levels of CHEMICALNOTIN are produced and secreted which may contribute to the higher CHEMICALNOTIN levels in plasma of preeclamptic patients. These mechanisms may be important in the pathophysiology of preeclampsia.
17429625	Preclinical pharmacokinetics and in vitro metabolism of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN): a potent oral multi-targeted GENEIN inhibitor against GENEIN and GENEIN-GENEIN. PURPOSE: CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a potent oral multi-targeted GENEIN inhibitor against GENEIN and GENEIN-GENEIN, has recently been approved for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) in CHEMICALNOTIN-acquired resistance and intolerance. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to characterize the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey. Possible mechanisms contributing to the incomplete oral bioavailability of CHEMICALNOTIN in animals were investigated. METHODS: Metabolic stability of CHEMICALNOTIN was measured after incubation with liver microsomes (either CHEMICALNOTIN- or CHEMICALNOTIN-fortified) and isolated hepatocytes obtained from mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human. In all cases, substrate depletion over time was measured, and appropriate scaling factors were used to predict in vivo clearance. Pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN were determined in mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys after administration of single intravenous or oral doses. In addition, the routes of excretion were investigated after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN to bile duct cannulated (BDC) rats. Absorption and first-pass metabolism were evaluated as possible reasons for the incomplete oral bioavailability using various in vitro and in vivo models like Caco-2 cells, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) knockout mice, and intra-portal dosing in rats. RESULTS: In vivo systemic plasma clearance values of CHEMICALNOTIN were 62, 26, 25, and 34 ml/min/kg in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, respectively. Scaling of in vitro hepatocyte and liver microsomal data gave reasonably good predictions of in vivo clearances across all species. Percent distribution in blood cells ranged from 43% in mouse to 57% in dog. CHEMICALNOTIN showed high volumes of distribution (>3 l/kg) and high serum protein binding values (>90%) in all four species tested. Oral bioavailability of CHEMICALNOTIN ranged from 14% in the mouse to 34% in the dog. In rats, bioavailability after an intraportal dose was comparable to that after intra-arterial administration. In BDC rats, less than 15% of an intravenous dose was excreted unchanged in urine, bile, and the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN is cleared primarily via metabolism. CHEMICALNOTIN has high intrinsic permeability in Caco-2 cells, however, the efflux ratio was approximately two-fold indicating that it may be a substrate for an intestinal efflux transporter. However, in vivo studies in GENENOTIN knockout mice versus wild-type mice showed no difference in the amount of CHEMICALNOTIN remaining unabsorbed in the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that GENENOTIN may not be responsible for the incomplete bioavailability. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALNOTIN shows intermediate clearance in mouse, rat, dog, and monkey, and distributes extensively in those species. Oxidative metabolism appears to be the predominant clearance pathway. The incomplete oral bioavailability may be due to both incomplete absorption and high first-pass metabolism. However, the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN does not appear to be limiting oral absorption.
17324336	Genetic linkage of Fc gamma RIIa and Fc gamma RIIIa and implications for their use in predicting clinical responses to CD20-directed monoclonal antibody therapy. BACKGROUND: Polymorphisms in FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa receptors are associated with responses to the CD20-directed immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody rituximab among patients with indolent lymphoma. At odds with the aforementioned clinical observations has been the finding that IgG1 binding is impacted by polymorphisms in FcgammaRIIIa but not FcgammaRIIa. One possibility for this discrepancy might involve linkage of polymorphisms between FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa. MATERIALS AND METHODS: As such, we performed allelespecific polymerase chain reaction and directed sequencing of the genomic DNA coding region of FcgammaRIIA and FcgammaRIIIA for 52 healthy individuals. RESULTS: Two common polymorphisms were observed for FcgammaRIIA (at positions 27 and 131) and FcgammaRIIIA (at positions 48 and 158). Importantly, we observed linkage among polymorphisms within and between FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa, including the expression of histidine at FcgammaRIIa-131 and valine at FcgammaRIIIa, both of which are associated with enhanced responses to rituximab. The results of these studies demonstrate that there is wide linkage within and between polymorphisms in FcgammaRIIa and FcgammaRIIIa and might provide an explanation for why polymorphisms at FcgammaRIIa are associated with rituximab responses despite a lack of impact on IgG1 binding. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of such linkages could facilitate the development of diagnostic tests aimed at identifying patients who might be more suitable for treatment with rituximab and possibly other therapeutic antibodies.
7582530	Characterization of an GENEIN mediating the contractile response of rat aorta to CHEMICALIN. 1. The affinities of a number of GENEIN antagonists were determined by displacement of CHEMICALIN binding from cloned GENEIN (previously designated cloned alpha 1c subtype), alpha 1B alpha 1D and GENEIN, stably expressed in rat-1 fibroblasts. Functional affinity estimates for these compounds were also determined from CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of rat aorta. 2. CHEMICALIN displayed high affinity for cloned GENEIN (pKi = 8.2 +/- 0.10) and was selective over alpha 1A (pKi = 6.2 +/- 0.10) and alpha 1B subtypes (6.7 +/- 0.11). WB 4101, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN displayed high affinity for GENEIN compared to the alpha 1B subtype. CHEMICALIN displayed high affinity and selectivity for GENEIN (pKi 8.8 +/- 0.16). CHEMICALIN was selective for cloned GENEIN. 3. Comparative binding affinities (pKi) for compounds at cloned GENENOTIN were almost identical (r = 0.99, slope = 1.08). 4. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were potent, competitive antagonists of CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of rat aorta (pA2 values of 9.8, 8.8 and 7.8 respectively). The selective alpha 1D antagonist CHEMICALNOTIN was also a potent antagonist on rat aorta (pKB = 8.3 +/- 0.1) but the interaction of this compound was not consistent with competitive antagonism at a single population of receptors. 5. Functional affinities for compounds determined against CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of rat aorta correlated well with binding affinities at cloned GENENOTIN (r = 0.96), but not with alpha 1A (r = 0.61) or alpha 1B (r = 0.46) subtypes. 6. CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated contractions of rat aorta were sensitive to the alkylating effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CEC (10 microM) caused a small rightward shift in the CHEMICALNOTIN concentration-response curve. CHEMICALNOTIN at 100 microM caused a further shift and suppression of the maximum response to CHEMICALNOTIN.7. The results of this study suggest that CHEMICALIN predominantly, but not exclusively, mediates contraction of rat aorta through the activation of an GENEIN.
23276150	Display of amino groups on substrate surfaces by simple dip-coating of methacrylate-based polymers and its application to DNA immobilization. The implementation of a reactive functional group onto a material surface is of great importance. Reactive functional groups (e.g., an amino group and a hydroxyl group) are usually hydrophilic, which makes it difficult to display them on a dry polymer surface. We here propose a novel method for displaying amino groups on the surfaces of polymeric substrates through dip-coating of a methacrylate-based copolymer. We synthesized copolymers composed of methyl methacrylate and 2-aminoethyl methacrylate with different protecting groups or ion-complexes on their amino groups, then dip-coated the copolymers onto a poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) substrate. Evaluation using a cleavable fluorescent compound, which was synthesized in the present study to quantify a small amount (pmol/cm(2)) of amino groups on a solid surface, revealed that the protection of amino groups affected their surface segregation in the copolymer coating. p-Toluenesulfonate ion-complex and tert-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) protection of amino groups were found to effectively display amino groups on the surface (more than 70 pmol/cm(2)). The density of amino groups displayed on a surface can be easily controlled by mixing the copolymer and PMMA before dip-coating. Dip-coating of the copolymer with Boc protection on various polymeric substrates also successfully displayed amino groups on their surfaces. Finally, we demonstrated that the amino groups displayed can be utilized for the immobilization of a DNA oligonucleotide on a substrate surface.
23123646	Neuroprotective role of GENENOTIN in cerebral ischemia. GENENOTIN are weak, inward rectifiers that couple metabolic status to cell membrane electrical activity, thus modulating many cellular functions. An increase in the CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN ratio opens GENEIN, leading to membrane hyperpolarization. GENENOTIN are ubiquitously expressed in neurons located in different regions of the brain, including the hippocampus and cortex. Brief hypoxia triggers membrane hyperpolarization in these central neurons. In vivo animal studies confirmed that knocking out the GENENOTIN subunit of the GENENOTIN increases ischemic infarction, and overexpression of the GENENOTIN subunit reduces neuronal injury from ischemic insults. These findings provide the basis for a practical strategy whereby activation of endogenous GENENOTIN reduces cellular damage resulting from cerebral ischemic stroke. GENENOTIN modulators may prove to be clinically useful as part of a combination therapy for stroke management in the future.
10693877	Comparison of the effect of CHEMICALIN (a GENEIN inhibitor), CHEMICALNOTIN, and placebo on the gastroduodenal mucosa of patients with osteoarthritis: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. The CHEMICALNOTIN Osteoarthritis Endoscopy Multinational Study Group. OBJECTIVE: This randomized, double-blind study tested the hypothesis that CHEMICALIN, a drug that specifically inhibits GENEIN, would cause fewer gastroduodenal ulcers than CHEMICALNOTIN (in a multicenter trial), and its side effects would be equivalent to those of placebo (in a prespecified analysis combining the results with another trial of identical design). METHODS: Seven hundred seventy-five patients with osteoarthritis were randomized to receive CHEMICALNOTIN at a dosage of 25 mg or 50 mg once daily, ibuprofen 800 mg 3 times daily, or placebo. Gastroduodenal ulceration was assessed by endoscopy at 6, 12, and (for active treatment) 24 weeks. The primary and secondary end points were the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers at 12 and 24 weeks, respectively. RESULTS: Ulcers were significantly less common (P < 0.001) following treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN (25 mg or 50 mg) than with CHEMICALNOTIN after 12 weeks (5.3% and 8.8% versus 29.2%, respectively) or 24 weeks (9.9% and 12.4% versus 46.8%, respectively). In the combined analysis, the 12-week ulcer incidence with 25 mg CHEMICALNOTIN (4.7%) and with placebo (7.3%) satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence. CONCLUSION: At 2-4 times the therapeutically effective dose, CHEMICALNOTIN caused fewer endoscopically detected ulcers than did CHEMICALNOTIN. Rofecoxib at a dose of 25 mg (the highest dose recommended for osteoarthritis) satisfied prespecified criteria for equivalence to placebo.
23611293	Profiling 976 ToxCast chemicals across 331 enzymatic and receptor signaling assays. Understanding potential health risks is a significant challenge due to large numbers of diverse chemicals with poorly characterized exposures and mechanisms of toxicities. The present study analyzes 976 chemicals (including failed pharmaceuticals, alternative plasticizers, food additives, and pesticides) in Phase I and II of the U.S. EPA's ToxCastâ¢ project across 331 cell-free enzymatic and ligand-binding high-throughput screening (HTS) assays. Half-maximal activity concentrations (AC50) were identified for 729 chemicals in 256 assays (7,135 chemical-assay pairs). Some of the most commonly affected assays were CYPs (CYP2C9, CYP2C19), transporters (mitochondrial TSPO, norepinephrine, dopaminergic), and GPCRs (aminergic). Heavy metals, surfactants, and dithiocarbamate fungicides showed promiscuous, but distinctly different patterns of activity whereas many of the pharma compounds showed promiscuous activity across GPCRs. Literature analysis confirmed >50% of the activities for the most potent chemical-assay pairs (56), but also revealed 10 missed interactions. Twenty-two chemicals with known estrogenic activity were correctly identified for the majority (77%), missing only the weaker interactions. In many cases, novel findings for previously unreported chemical-target combinations clustered with known chemical-target interactions. Results from this large inventory of chemical-biological interactions can inform read-across methods as well as to link potential targets to molecular initiating events in adverse outcome pathways for diverse toxicities. This abstract does not necessarily reflect U.S. EPA policy.
23123250	A combination of CHEMICALNOTIN improves protection against soman toxicity compared to CHEMICALNOTIN in guinea pigs. The neuropathologic mechanisms after exposure to lethal doses of nerve agent are complex and involve multiple biochemical pathways. Effective treatment requires drugs that can simultaneously protect by reversible binding to the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and blocking cascades of seizure related brain damage, inflammation, neuronal degeneration as well as promoting induction of neuroregeneration. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), is a naturally occurring potent reversible GENEIN inhibitor that penetrates the blood-brain barrier. It also has several neuroprotective effects including modification of GENENOTIN, reduction of oxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and induction and regulation of GENENOTIN. Toxicities at higher doses restrict the neuroporotective ability of CHEMICALNOTIN for treatment. The synthetic stereoisomer, CHEMICALIN, is less toxic due to poor GENEIN inhibition and is suitable for both pre-/post-exposure treatments of nerve agent toxicity. CHEMICALNOTIN block the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced seizure in rats, reduce excitatory CHEMICALNOTIN induced neurotoxicity and also prevent soman induced toxicity with minimum performance decrement. Unique combinations of two stereo-isomers of CHEMICALNOTIN may provide an excellent pre/post-treatment drug for the nerve agent induced seizure/status epilepticus. We investigated a combination of CHEMICALNOTIN with a small dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) against CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity. Our data showed that pretreatment with a combination CHEMICALNOTIN significantly increased the survival rate and reduced behavioral abnormalities after exposure to 1.2ÃLD50 soman compared to CHEMICALNOTIN in guinea pigs. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment inhibited the development of high power of EEG better than CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment alone. These data suggest that a combination of CHEMICALNOTIN offers better protection than CHEMICALNOTIN and serves as a potent medical countermeasure against lethal dose nerve agent toxicity in guinea pigs.
23564313	CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells is mediated by GENEIN (GENEIN) via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. Despite the availability of melanoma treatment at the primary site, the recurrence of local melanoma can metastasize to any distant organ. Currently, the available therapies for the treatment of metastatic melanoma are of limited benefit. Thus, the functional analysis of conventional therapies may help to improve their efficiency in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. In the present study, the exposure of melanoma cells to CHEMICALIN was found to trigger apoptosis as evidenced by the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, the release of both GENEIN and GENEIN, activation of GENENOTIN, and cleavage of GENEIN. Also, CHEMICALIN enhances the phosphorylation of GENEIN, the accumulation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species, the release of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN, as well as the activation of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN) GENEIN, and GENEIN. In addition, CHEMICALIN induces the DNA-binding activities of the transcription factor GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, together with the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN proteins. Moreover, inhibitory experiments addressed a central role for GENENOTIN in the regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells via mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial-dependent mechanisms. In conclusion, the present study addresses for the first time a central role for GENENOTIN in the modulation of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis of melanoma cells and thereby provides an insight into the molecular action of CHEMICALNOTIN in melanoma treatment.
10373451	Cloning and characterization of a novel GENEIN that hydrolyzes both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (GENEIN). cDNA encoding a novel GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was isolated from a human fetal lung cDNA library and designated GENENOTIN. The deduced CHEMICALIN sequence contains 779 CHEMICALIN, including a putative GENENOTIN in the CHEMICALIN-terminal portion of the molecule and a catalytic domain that is 16-47% identical in CHEMICALIN sequence to those of other GENEIN families. Recombinant GENEIN transfected and expressed in COS-7 cells hydrolyzed CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN with Km values of 0.26 and 7.2 microM, respectively, and Vmax with CHEMICALIN was almost twice that with CHEMICALIN. Of the GENEIN inhibitors tested, CHEMICALIN was most effective, with IC50 values of 1.2 and 0.45 microM for inhibition of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN hydrolysis, respectively. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited hydrolysis of CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis with IC50 values of 14 and 0.39 microM, respectively. Thus, GENENOTIN exhibited properties of a GENENOTIN and a GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN transcripts were particularly abundant in the putamen and caudate nucleus regions of brain and in thyroid and testis, and in much lower amounts in other tissues. The GENENOTIN gene was located on chromosome 6q26 by fluorescent in situ hybridization analysis. GENENOTIN represents a new member of the GENENOTIN superfamily, exhibiting unique kinetic properties and inhibitor sensitivity.
12907443	Effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN levels, red cell adhesion, and hematopoietic differentiation in patients with sickle cell disease. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) decreases polymerization of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and improves outcomes in sickle cell disease (SSD). Therefore, a therapeutic goal in SSD is pharmacologic reactivation of GENENOTIN. Silencing of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) gene is associated with DNA methylation. The CHEMICALIN analog CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) hypomethylates DNA by inhibiting GENEIN. We examined if subcutaneous CHEMICALIN could increase GENEIN levels and improve SSD pathophysiology without cytotoxicity. Eight symptomatic SSD patients resistant or intolerant of standard treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN received CHEMICALNOTIN 0.2 mg/kg subcutaneously 1 to 3 times per week in 2 cycles of 6-week duration. Treatment decreased neutrophils and increased mean GENENOTIN (6.5% to 20.4%, P <.0001) and mean total GENENOTIN (76 to 96 g/L [7.6 to 9.6 g/dL], P <.001). Features of vaso-occlusive crisis pathophysiology such as red cell adhesion, endothelial damage, and coagulation pathway activity significantly improved. GENENOTIN methylation decreased, and platelets and the proportion of megakaryocytes and erythroid cells in the marrow increased without a decrease in marrow cellularity, consistent with a DNA hypomethylating, noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Weekly subcutaneous CHEMICALIN produces cumulative increases in GENEIN and total GENEIN through a noncytotoxic mechanism of action. Chronic dosing and sustained increases in GENENOTIN and total GENENOTIN levels may be possible. Further studies in SSD and thalassemia are indicated.
23583257	CHEMICALIN compounds regulate the level of ROS production by the GENEIN GENEIN. GENENOTIN GENENOTIN is expressed in a wide range of tissues and plays a role in cellular signaling by providing reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) as intracellular messengers. GENEIN GENEIN activity is thought to be constitutive and regulated at the transcriptional level; however, we challenge this point of view and suggest that specific CHEMICALIN derivatives could modulate this activity. In fact, we demonstrated a significant stimulation of GENEIN activity by 4 CHEMICALIN derivatives (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN) observed in 3 different cellular models, HEK293E, T-RExâ¢, and chondrocyte cell lines. Our results indicate that the effect is specific toward GENENOTIN versus GENENOTIN. Furthermore, we showed that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) may participate in this stimulation. Interestingly, GENENOTIN activity is also stimulated by reducing agents that possibly act by reducing the CHEMICALNOTIN bridge (CHEMICALIN226, CHEMICALIN270) located in the GENENOTIN of GENEIN. Such model of GENEIN activity regulation could provide new insight into the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the electron transfer through the enzyme, i.e., its potential redox regulation, and could also define new therapeutic targets in diseases in which CHEMICALIN and GENENOTIN are implicated.
21475861	Does CHEMICALNOTIN acetylate multiple cellular proteins? (Review). CHEMICALNOTIN is a CHEMICALNOTIN drug that is extensively used for its anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, analgesic and anti-thrombotic effects. More recently, it has been shown to decrease the incidence of cancers of epithelial origin. In most cases, CHEMICALNOTIN is relatively safe. However, it does cause a host of adverse effects and toxicities, including gastrointestinal bleeding, ulcerations, nephrotoxicity and hypersensitivity reactions. Although the inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN, which leads to its anti-inflammatory/analgesic properties, has been well studied, the mechanisms involved in its chemopreventive effects as well as some of its adverse effects are as yet ill-defined. Studies over the past decades suggest that, besides GENEIN, CHEMICALIN acetylates other cellular proteins. These studies used radiolabeled CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, the only approach used to date for the detection of proteins acetylated by CHEMICALNOTIN. In a recent study using protein-specific anti-acetyl CHEMICALNOTIN antibodies and immunological methods, we demonstrated the ability of CHEMICALIN to acetylate the GENEIN. In this review, we present current research from the literature on the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced acetylation of proteins. We also describe an immunological approach to detecting acetylated proteins in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated cells, and demonstrate that multiple proteins are acetylated. Since post-translational modification of proteins, such as acetylation, may lead to the alteration of their function, it is possible that some of the hitherto unexplained beneficial or adverse effects of CHEMICALNOTIN could occur as a result of these modifications. The identification of these novel acetylation targets of CHEMICALNOTIN represents a new area for investigation.
23344961	GENENOTIN deficiency enhances CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a GENEIN-targeting drug that stabilizes GENEIN-DNA covalent adducts, can induce S-phase-specific cytotoxicity due to the arrest of progressing replication forks. However, CHEMICALNOTIN-induced non-S-phase cytotoxicity is less well characterized. In this study, we have identified GENEIN (GENEIN) as a specific determinant for CHEMICALIN sensitivity, but not for many other cytotoxic agents, in non-S-phase cells. First, quiescent mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) lacking GENENOTIN were shown to be hypersensitive to CHEMICALNOTIN with prominent induction of apoptosis. Second, CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN catalytic inhibitor known to deplete GENEIN, specifically sensitized MEFs to CHEMICALNOTIN. To explore the molecular basis for CHEMICALNOTIN hypersensitivity in GENENOTIN-deficient cells, we found that upon CHEMICALIN exposure, the GENEIN (GENEIN) became progressively depleted, followed by recovery to nearly the original level in wild-type MEFs, whereas GENEIN remained depleted without recovery in GENENOTIN-deficient cells. Concomitant with the reduction of the GENENOTIN level, the GENENOTIN protein level was greatly induced. Interestingly, GENENOTIN depletion has been well documented to lead to GENENOTIN-dependent apoptosis. Altogether, our findings support a model in which GENENOTIN deficiency promotes CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis in quiescent non-S-phase cells, possibly due to GENEIN depletion and GENEIN accumulation.
2833901	Effects of CHEMICALIN (a CHEMICALIN GENEIN blocker) and analogues on GENENOTIN. We have examined the effects on the activities of three GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN) of the CHEMICALIN GENEIN blocker CHEMICALIN and three analogues (CHEMICALIN, oxidized and CHEMICALIN) exhibiting different pharmacological potencies. The GENEIN was inhibited completely by CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue with IC50 values of 3.7 and 1.5 microM respectively. The oxidized and CHEMICALIN analogues were relatively ineffective in inhibiting GENEIN. CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue inhibited the basal (CHEMICALNOTIN/calmodulin-independent) activity of GENEIN as well as the GENEIN-stimulated activity. GENENOTIN was relatively ineffective in preventing inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue. These observations suggest that CHEMICALIN may act directly on the GENEIN as well as through GENEIN. CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN-dependent GENEIN with similar potencies (IC50 = 17.4 microM), whereas the oxidized and CHEMICALIN analogues caused no inhibition. Similarly, CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue inhibited GENEIN activity whether the isolated 20 kD light chain (IC50 = 12.6 microM) or intact GENENOTIN (IC50 = 11.0 microM) was used as substrate. Inhibition in each case was prevented by excess GENENOTIN. The oxidized and CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives caused little or no inhibition. Finally, the effects of CHEMICALIN and the three analogues on two processes which are dependent on GENEIN phosphorylation were examined, namely the GENENOTIN-activated GENEIN activity of GENEIN and the assembly of GENEIN filaments. CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue inhibited the GENENOTIN-activated GENEIN activity of smooth muscle GENEIN (IC50 = 25.1 microM). The oxidized and CHEMICALNOTIN analogues exhibited no inhibition. Similarly, CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue blocked GENEIN filament assembly induced by low concentrations of GENENOTIN, whereas the oxidized and CHEMICALIN analogues did not. Again, inhibition of the GENENOTIN-activated GENEIN GENEIN and GENEIN filament assembly by CHEMICALIN and the CHEMICALIN analogue could be reversed by raising the GENENOTIN concentration. These observations suggest that some of the pharmacological actions of CHEMICALIN on smooth muscle may involve inhibition of GENEIN which are functionally involved in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction.
23541637	CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN and basal GENEIN trafficking via GENEIN-GENEIN trans Golgi signalling in M1 cortical collecting duct cells. CHEMICALIN regulates CHEMICALNOTIN transport in the distal nephron through multiple mechanisms that include the transcriptional control of epithelial GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN subunits. CHEMICALIN also induces the rapid phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN). GENENOTIN isoforms regulate protein trafficking, by the control of vesicle fission from the trans Golgi network (TGN) through activation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). We report rapid GENENOTIN translocation to the plasma membrane after 30min aldosterone treatment in polarized M1 cortical collecting duct cells, which was significantly impaired in GENENOTIN shRNA-mediated knockdown cells. In GENENOTIN-deficient cells, the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive current was significantly reduced and GENENOTIN subunits showed aberrant localization. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN localize to the TGN, and CHEMICALIN induced an interaction between GENEIN and GENEIN following CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. This study reveals a novel mechanism for rapid regulation of GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN, via directed trafficking through GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN signalling at the level of the TGN.
10727715	The role of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN on the modulation of acute CHEMICALNOTIN-induced changes in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN: the mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN. Some clinical evidence has suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN can be effective at producing a shortened time to onset of antidepressant activity when co-administered with a CHEMICALNOTIN specific reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). This effect has been attributed to the antagonist effects of CHEMICALIN at the GENEIN receptor. In the present study, we compared the pharmacology of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (a GENEIN antagonist), CHEMICALNOTIN (a GENENOTIN antagonist), and CHEMICALIN (a GENEIN antagonist), when given acutely in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN, using in vivo microdialysis in the frontal cortex of the freely moving rat. We have determined that the acute CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increases in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN can be augmented by CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN with maximum increases of 216+/-32%, 235+/-49%, 240+/-18% and 171+/-47% of preinjection control levels, respectively. Combination of both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN autoreceptor antagonists with CHEMICALNOTIN produced additive increases in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (i.e. CHEMICALNOTIN+CHEMICALNOTIN+CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN+CHEMICALNOTIN+CHEMICALNOTIN produced a four- and five-fold potentiation, respectively), suggesting that this strategy may be useful in further augmenting the action of a SSRI in the treatment of depression. In addition, by comparing the combined administration of CHEMICALNOTIN with either CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, we have determined that CHEMICALIN produces much of its acute potentiation of CHEMICALIN-induced increases in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN via its action at the GENENOTIN in addition to any activity it has at the presynaptic GENEIN receptor.
23353748	Design, synthesis and biological evaluation of novel hybrid compounds of imidazole scaffold-based 2-benzylbenzofuran as potent anticancer agents. A series of novel hybrid compounds between 2-benzylbenzofuran and imidazole has been prepared and evaluated inÂ vitro against a panel of human tumor cell lines. The results suggest that the existence of benzimidazole ring and substitution of the imidazolyl-3-position with a naphthylacyl or 4-methoxyphenacyl group were vital for modulating cytotoxic activity. In particular, hybrid compounds 46 and 47 were found to be the most potent derivatives against 5 strains human tumor cell lines and more active than cisplatin (DDP), and exhibited cytotoxic activities selectively against breast carcinoma (MCF-7) and myeloid liver carcinoma (SMMC-7721), respectively.
23636303	Involvement of CHEMICALNOTIN GENENOTIN receptors in the modulation of noradrenergic transmission by CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors: a microdialysis study in rat brain. RATIONALE: Selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), in addition to being able to enhance serotonergic neurotransmission, are able to modulate other brain systems involved in depression. OBJECTIVES: This study evaluates the neurochemical effect of the SSRI citalopram on brain noradrenergic activity and the GENENOTIN involved in this effect. METHODS: Dual-probe microdialysis in the locus coeruleus (LC) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) was performed in freely awake rats. RESULTS: Systemic CHEMICALNOTIN (10Â mg/kg, i.p.) increased CHEMICALNOTIN (NA) in the LC (E maxâ=â141âÂ±â13Â %) and simultaneously decreased NA in the PFC (Emaxâ=â-46âÂ±â7Â %). In the local presence into the LC of the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (1Â Î¼M), systemic CHEMICALNOTIN increased NA in the LC (Emaxâ=â157âÂ±â25Â %) and PFC (Emaxâ=â175âÂ±â24Â %). Local CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1-100Â Î¼M) into the LC induced NA increase in the LC (Emaxâ=â210âÂ±â25Â %) and decrease in the PFC (Emaxâ=â-38âÂ±â9Â %). Local LC CHEMICALIN effect was abolished by LC presence of the GENEIN receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN (1Â Î¼M) but not the GENEIN receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN (1Â Î¼M). Systemic CHEMICALNOTIN in the LC presence of CHEMICALNOTIN did not modify NA in the LC but increased NA in the PFC (Emaxâ=â158âÂ±â26Â %). Local CHEMICALNOTIN into the PFC enhanced NA (Emaxâ=â376âÂ±â18Â %) in the area, which was prevented by CHEMICALNOTIN. CONCLUSIONS: The SSRI CHEMICALIN modulates central noradrenergic neurotransmission by activation, through endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN, of GENEIN receptors expressed in the somatodendritic (LC) and terminal (PFC) areas, which subsequently promote an enhancement of local NA. Therefore, GENENOTIN receptors and somatodendritic GENENOTIN in the LC play an important role in the global effect of SSRIs.
17658513	Expressions and mechanical functions of GENENOTIN subtypes in hamster ureter. We characterized the GENENOTIN subtypes in hamster ureters according to gene and protein expressions and contractile function. Real-time quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine mRNA levels and receptor protein expressions respectively, for GENENOTIN in hamster ureteral smooth muscle. GENENOTIN antagonists were tested against the CHEMICALIN (GENEIN agonist)-induced contraction in isolated hamster ureteral preparations using a functional experimental approach. In the smooth muscle, relative mRNA expression levels for GENENOTIN were 10.7%, 1.2% and 88.1%, respectively, and protein expressions were identified for GENENOTIN immunohistochemically. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (GENEIN agonist) each produced a concentration-dependent tonic contraction, their pD(2) values being 6.87+/-0.08 and 6.10+/-0.05, respectively. CHEMICALIN (nonselective GENEIN antagonist), CHEMICALIN (selective GENEIN antagonist) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) (selective GENEIN antagonist) competitively antagonized the CHEMICALIN-induced contraction (pA(2) values, 8.60+/-0.07, 9.44+/-0.06 and 5.75+/-0.07, respectively). CHEMICALNOTIN (3x10(-6) mol/L or more) produced a rightward shift in the concentration-response curve for CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, in hamster ureters, GENENOTIN were more prevalent than the GENENOTIN, with contraction being mediated mainly via GENENOTIN. If these findings hold true for humans, GENENOTIN antagonists could become useful medication for stone passage in urolithiasis patients.
15494035	Amylin receptors: molecular composition and pharmacology. Several receptors which bind the hormone AMY (amylin) with high affinity have now been identified. The minimum binding unit is composed of the CT (calcitonin) receptor at its core, plus a RAMP (receptor activity modifying protein). The receptors have been named AMY(1(a)), AMY(2(a)) and AMY(3(a)) in accordance with the association of the CT receptor (CT((a))) with RAMP1, RAMP2 and RAMP3 respectively. The challenge is now to determine the localization and pharmacological nature of each of these receptors. Recent attempts to achieve these aims will be briefly discussed.
22836881	Hospitalized osteoporotic vertebral fracture increases the risk of stroke: a population-based cohort study. The association between osteoporosis and cardiovascular diseases has been demonstrated. Higher cardiovascular risk has also been correlated with vertebral fractures. However, the association between osteoporotic vertebral fracture and the possibly higher risk of stroke remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, risk, and type of stroke in patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture. Patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture were identified (nâ=â380) and 10 age- and sex-matched controls per case (comparison group, nâ=â3795) were chosen from a nationwide representative cohort of 999,997 people from 1998 to 2005. Both groups were followed-up for stroke events for 3 years, matched by propensity scores with adjustments for covariates such as comorbidities (ie, hypertension, diabetes, arrhythmia, or coronary heart diseases) and exposure to medications (ie, aspirin, lipid lowering drug, or nitrates), and assessed by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses. The incidence rate of stroke in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture group (37.5 per 1000 person-years; 95% confidence interval [CI], 27.5-51.2) was significantly higher than in the comparison group (14.0 per 1000 person-years; 95% CI, 12.0-16.4, pâ<â0.001). Stroke was more likely to occur in the osteoporotic vertebral fracture patients than in the normal controls (crude hazard ratio [HR] 2.68, 95% CI 1.89-3.79, pâ<â0.001; adjusted HR 2.71, 95% CI 1.90-3.86, pâ<â0.001). In conclusion, patients with osteoporotic vertebral fracture have a higher risk of stroke (ie, both ischemic and hemorrhagic) and require stroke prevention strategies.
21262851	Inhibition of recombinant GENENOTIN by positive allosteric modulators of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) depress neuronal excitability via positive allosteric modulation of inhibitory GENEIN (GENEIN). CHEMICALIN and other positive GENEIN modulators, including CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, can also inhibit GENEIN (GENEIN), which could contribute to reduced neuronal excitability. Because neuronal GENENOTIN function is up-regulated after long-term GENENOTIN modulator exposure, an interaction with GENENOTIN may also play a role in physical dependence. The current studies assessed the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN on whole-cell CHEMICALNOTIN currents through recombinant neuronal GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN expressed with beta(3) and alpha(2)delta-1 in HEK293T cells. CHEMICALNOTIN was the most potent inhibitor (IC(50), approximately 10 muM), followed by CHEMICALNOTIN (IC(50), approximately 50 muM), CHEMICALNOTIN (IC(50), 0.3-1 mM), and CHEMICALNOTIN (IC(50), approximately 300 mM). GENEIN channels were less sensitive to CHEMICALIN inhibition than GENEIN channels, similar to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) GENEIN antagonists. All GENENOTIN modulators induced a negative shift in the steady-state inactivation curve of GENENOTIN channels, but only CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN induced a negative shift in GENEIN channel inactivation. Mutation of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) in GENENOTIN channels reduced CHEMICALNOTIN potency. Despite the structural similarity between CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, mutation of an CHEMICALNOTIN important for CHEMICALNOTIN potency (GENEIN) did not affect CHEMICALIN potency. Although GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN occurred at concentrations that are possibly too high to be clinically relevant and is not likely to play a role in the up-regulation of GENEIN during long-term treatment, CHEMICALIN and ethanol inhibited GENEIN at clinically relevant concentrations.
23542513	CHEMICALIN inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN production in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BV2 microglia via GENEIN suppression and GENEIN-dependent GENEIN induction. In this study, we found that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) from Hizikia fusiforme considerably inhibits lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN production by suppressing the expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) in BV2 microglia. In addition, CHEMICALIN blocked LPS-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN, resulting in suppression of the nuclear translocation of GENEIN (GENEIN) subunits, namely GENEIN and GENEIN, which are important molecules involved in the regulation of GENEIN expression. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a specific GENEIN inhibitor, along with GENENOTIN inhibitor (PSI) significantly inhibited LPS-induced GENEIN expression, which indirectly suggested that CHEMICALIN downregulated GENEIN expression by suppressing GENEIN activity. Thus, we found that CHEMICALIN enhances GENEIN (GENEIN) expression via GENEIN (GENEIN) activation. In addition, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a specific GENEIN inducer, predominantly suppressed LPS-induced CHEMICALNOTIN production. In contrast, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a specific GENEIN inhibitor, showed a partial suppressive effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on LPS-induced CHEMICALNOTIN production. Further, CHEMICALIN increased specific DNA-binding activity of GENEIN, and transient knockdown with GENEIN siRNA subsequently reversed CHEMICALIN-induced CHEMICALIN inhibition, which was followed by suppression of GENEIN activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that CHEMICALIN suppresses CHEMICALIN production through modulation of GENEIN, consequently suppressing GENEIN activity and induction of GENEIN-dependent GENEIN activity.
23582273	Synthesis and antitumor activity of CHEMICALIN possessing CHEMICALIN moiety as a novel class of potent GENEIN inhibitors. A series of CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives containing CHEMICALNOTIN moiety (7a-7q) have been designed, synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activity. Most of the synthesized compounds were proved to have potent antitumor activity and low toxicity. Among them, compound 7a showed the most potent biological activity against Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial cells, which was comparable to the positive control. The results of apoptosis and flow cytometry (FCM) demonstrated that compound 7a induce cell apoptosis by the inhibition of GENENOTIN pathway. Molecular docking was performed to position compound 7a into GENENOTIN binding site in order to explore the potential target.
23131798	Discovery of novel GENENOTIN ligands by a virtual screening approach: further development of CHEMICALIN as GENEIN agonists. 3D ligand-based virtual screening was employed to identify novel scaffolds for GENENOTIN ligand development. A total of 112 compounds with diverse structures were purchased from commercial vendors. 12 GENENOTIN receptor antagonists/inverse agonists and 10 GENENOTIN receptor agonists were identified in vitro. One of the GENEIN agonists, CHEMICALIN (19, -logEC(50)=7.5, E(max)=255%) was selected for further development. As far as we are aware, the compound's CHEMICALIN scaffold represents a new core structure for GENEIN agonists. A library of fifty-seven CHEMICALNOTIN was created to clarify the structure-activity relationship study of the analogs.
17397529	Inborn errors in the metabolism of glutathione. Glutathione is a tripeptide composed of glutamate, cysteine and glycine. Glutathione is present in millimolar concentrations in most mammalian cells and it is involved in several fundamental biological functions, including free radical scavenging, detoxification of xenobiotics and carcinogens, redox reactions, biosynthesis of DNA, proteins and leukotrienes, as well as neurotransmission/neuromodulation. Glutathione is metabolised via the gamma-glutamyl cycle, which is catalyzed by six enzymes. In man, hereditary deficiencies have been found in five of the six enzymes. Glutathione synthetase deficiency is the most frequently recognized disorder and, in its severe form, it is associated with hemolytic anemia, metabolic acidosis, 5-oxoprolinuria, central nervous system (CNS) damage and recurrent bacterial infections. Gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency is also associated with hemolytic anemia, and some patients with this disorder show defects of neuromuscular function and generalized aminoaciduria. Gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase deficiency has been found in patients with CNS involvement and glutathionuria. 5-Oxoprolinase deficiency is associated with 5-oxoprolinuria but without a clear association with other symptoms. Dipeptidase deficiency has been described in one patient. All disorders are very rare and inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Most of the mutations are leaky so that many patients have residual enzyme activity. Diagnosis is made by measuring the concentration of different metabolites in the gamma-glutamyl cycle, enzyme activity and in glutathione synthetase and gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase deficiency, also by mutation analysis. Prenatal diagnosis has been preformed in glutathione synthetase deficiency. The prognosis is difficult to predict, as few patients are known, but seems to vary significantly between different patients. The aims of the treatment of glutathione synthesis defects are to avoid hemolytic crises and to increase the defense against reactive oxygen species. No treatment has been recommended for gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, 5-oxoprolinase and dipeptidase deficiency.
12727196	Properties of purified recombinant GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN. The discovery of an inducible GENEIN whose apparent substrate preference is CHEMICALIN indicates that CHEMICALNOTIN catabolism is more complex than that originally proposed. To facilitate the study of this enzyme, the purification and characterization of the recombinant GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN GENENOTIN are reported. Purified GENEIN/GENEIN oxidizes both CHEMICALIN (K(m)=1.6 microM) and CHEMICALIN (K(m)=51 microM), but does not oxidize CHEMICALIN. The purified human enzyme also does not oxidize eight representative antitumor CHEMICALIN analogues; however, specific oligamine analogues were found to be potent inhibitors of the oxidation of CHEMICALIN by GENEIN/GENEIN. The results of these studies are consistent with the hypothesis that GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN represents a new addition to the CHEMICALNOTIN metabolic pathway that may represent a new target for antineoplastic drug development.
12650833	Effects of GENENOTIN inhibitors on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced antinociception in the tail flick test in mice. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced antinociception in the tail flick test in mice, and on CHEMICALNOTIN binding to the forebrain crude synaptosome fraction. Neither CHEMICALIN nor CHEMICALIN (1-10000 nM) displaced CHEMICALIN from its specific binding sites, which indicates that they do not interact at the GENEIN level. The i.c.v. administration of very low doses of CHEMICALIN (0.001-1 pg/mouse) and CHEMICALIN (0.001-1 ng/mouse), which inhibit GENEIN, produced a dose-dependent antagonism of the antinociception induced by CHEMICALNOTIN (s.c.). However, CHEMICALIN (0.001 pg/mouse-1 ng/mouse, i.c.v.), an analogue of CHEMICALIN lacking activity against GENEIN, did not affect the antinociceptive effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. On the other hand, high doses of CHEMICALIN (10 ng/mouse, i.c.v.) and CHEMICALIN (1 microg/mouse, i.c.v.), which also block GENEIN, and CHEMICALIN (0.1 fg/mouse-1 ng/mouse, i.c.v.), which inhibits equally both GENEIN and GENEIN, did not modify the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced antinociception. These results suggest that the activation of GENEIN may play a role in the antinociceptive effect of CHEMICALIN, and that GENENOTIN might counterbalace this activity.
20185318	GENENOTIN inhibitors. Inhibition of GENEIN with a series of natural product CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. A series of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN natural products, such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, were investigated for their inhibitory effects against the GENEIN GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN). All mammalian isozymes of human (h) or murine (m) origin GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were inhibited in the low micromolar or submicromolar range by these (poly)phenols (K(I)s in the range of 0.87-7.79 microM). CHEMICALNOTIN was the best inhibitor of all isozymes (K(I)s of 0.87-35.4 microM) and the different isozymes showed very variable inhibition profiles with these derivatives. CHEMICALIN like the ones investigated here possess a GENEIN inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN used clinically or the CHEMICALIN. Unlike the CHEMICALNOTIN, which bind to the catalytic CHEMICALNOTIN ion, CHEMICALNOTIN are anchored at the CHEMICALNOTIN-coordinated water molecule and bind more externally within the active site cavity, making contacts with various CHEMICALNOTIN residues. As this is the region with the highest variability between the many GENENOTIN isozymes found in mammals, this class of compounds may lead to isoform-selective inhibitors targeting just one or few of the medicinally relevant GENENOTIN.
15689518	Crystal structure of the CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN from human liver. GENEIN (GENEIN), a member of the beta-family of CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent (PLP) enzymes, catalyzes the deamination of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN to yield CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. The crystal structure of GENENOTIN from human liver (GENENOTIN) has been solved at 2.5 A-resolution by molecular replacement. The structure is a homodimer and reveals a fold typical for beta-family PLP-dependent enzymes. Each monomer serves as an active unit and is subdivided into two distinct domains: a small domain and a GENENOTIN that covalently anchors the cofactor. Both domains show the typical open alpha/beta architecture of PLP enzymes. Comparison with the GENEIN-(PLP-OMS) holo-enzyme reveals a large structural difference in active sites caused by the artifical CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, the activity of GENENOTIN-PLP was assayed and it proved to show catalytic activity. That suggests that the structure of GENENOTIN-PLP is the first structure of the active natural holo-GENENOTIN.
23578688	Synthesis and evaluation of CHEMICALIN linked prodrugs of CHEMICALIN, a clinical GENEIN inhibitor. A series of CHEMICALIN linked prodrugs of 1 (CHEMICALIN), a clinical GENEIN inhibitor, were synthesized and evaluated. Though the CHEMICALNOTIN (3, 4, and 5) and CHEMICALNOTIN (22, 23, and 26) were found unstable at neutral pH values, CHEMICALNOTIN derived CHEMICALNOTIN (2, 28, and 31) were highly stable under both acidic and neutral conditions. Prodrugs 2 and 31 were also highly soluble at both acidic and neutral pH values. At a solution dose of 14.2mpk (equivalent to 10mpk of 1), 2 gave essentially the same exposure of 1 compared to dosing 10mpk of 1 itself. At a suspension dose of 142mpk (equivalent to 100mpk of 1), 2 demonstrated that it could overcome the solubility issue associated with 1 and provide a much higher exposure of 1. To our knowledge, the unique type of prodrugs like 2, 28, and 31 was not reported in the past and could represent a novel prodrug approach for CHEMICALNOTIN, a class of molecules frequently identified as drug candidates.
23473030	Iron and diabetes risk. Iron overload is a risk factor for diabetes. The link between iron and diabetes was first recognized in pathologic conditions-hereditary hemochromatosis and thalassemia-but high levels of dietary iron also impart diabetes risk. Iron plays a direct and causal role in diabetes pathogenesis mediated both by Î² cell failure and insulin resistance. Iron also regulates metabolism in most tissues involved in fuel homeostasis, with the adipocyte in particular serving an iron-sensing role. The underlying molecular mechanisms mediating these effects are numerous and incompletely understood but include oxidant stress and modulation of adipokines and intracellular signal transduction pathways.
12956944	Changes of phosphorylation of GENEIN in rat nucleus accumbens after chronic CHEMICALIN intake: CHEMICALIN reversal. AIM: To study the changes in the expression and phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN) in the rat nucleus accumbens after chronic CHEMICALIN intake and its withdrawal. METHODS: CHEMICALNOTIN was given in drinking water at the concentration of 6 % (v/v), for one month. Changes in the levels of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) protein in the nucleus accumbens were measured by immunohistochemistry methods. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN given to rats in drinking water decreased the level of GENEIN protein in the nucleus accumbens (-75 %) at the time of exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN. The decrement of GENEIN protein in the nucleus accumbens remained at 24 h (-35 %) and 72 h (-28 %) of CHEMICALIN withdrawal, which recovered toward control level after 7 d of CHEMICALIN withdrawal. However, chronic CHEMICALIN, as well as CHEMICALIN withdrawal failed to produce any significant alteration in the level of GENEIN protein in the nucleus accumbens. CHEMICALIN (alone) treatment of rats had no effect on the levels of GENEIN and GENEIN protein in the nucleus accumbens. However, when naloxone was administered concurrently with CHEMICALIN treatment, it antagonized the down-regulation of GENEIN protein in the nucleus accumbens (142 %) of rats exposed to CHEMICALIN. CONCLUSION: A long-term intake of CHEMICALIN solution down-regulates the phosphorylation of GENEIN in the nucleus accumbens, and those changes can be reversed by CHEMICALIN, which may be one kind of the molecular mechanisms associated with CHEMICALNOTIN dependence.
23397055	Impaired function of prejunctional GENENOTIN expressed by perivascular sympathetic nerves in CHEMICALNOTIN-salt hypertensive rats. Increased sympathetic nervous system activity contributes to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-salt hypertension in rats. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (NE) are coreleased from perivascular sympathetic nerves. NE acts at prejunctional GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) to inhibit NE release, and GENENOTIN function is impaired in CHEMICALNOTIN-salt rats. CHEMICALIN, an enzymatic CHEMICALNOTIN degradation product, acts at prejunctional GENEIN (GENENOTIN) to inhibit NE release. We tested the hypothesis that prejunctional GENENOTIN function is impaired in sympathetic nerves supplying mesenteric arteries (MAs) and veins (MVs) of CHEMICALNOTIN-salt rats. Electrically evoked NE release and constrictions of blood vessels were studied in vitro with use of amperometry to measure NE oxidation currents and video microscopy, respectively. Immunohistochemical methods were used to localize GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN in perivascular sympathetic nerves. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN colocalized to perivascular sympathetic nerves. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, GENEIN agonist) constricted MVs but not MAs. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (0.001-10 ÂµM) inhibited neurogenic constrictions and NE release in MAs and MVs. CHEMICALNOTIN-salt arteries were resistant to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated inhibition of NE release and constriction. The GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) (0.001-0.1 Î¼M) did not alter NE oxidation currents. We conclude that there are prejunctional GENEIN in arteries and both pre- and postjunctional GENEIN in veins; thus, CHEMICALIN selectively constricts the veins. Prejunctional GENENOTIN function is impaired in arteries, but not veins, from CHEMICALNOTIN-salt rats. Sympathetic autoreceptor dysfunction is not specific to GENENOTIN, but there is a more general disruption of prejunctional mechanisms controlling sympathetic neurotransmitter release in CHEMICALNOTIN-salt hypertension.
11351021	Functional consequences of the arrhythmogenic G306R KvLQT1 K+ channel mutant probed by viral gene transfer in cardiomyocytes. IKs, the slow component of the delayed rectifier potassium current, figures prominently in the repolarization of heart cells. The K+ channel gene KvLQT1 is mutated in the heritable long QT (LQT) syndrome. Heterologous coexpression of KvLQT1 and the accessory protein minK yields an IKs-like current. Nevertheless, the links between KvLQT1 and cardiac IKs are largely inferential. Since the LQT syndrome mutant KvLQT1-G306R suppresses channel activity when coexpressed with wild-type KvLQT1 in a heterologous system, overexpression of this mutant in cardiomyocytes should reduce or eliminate native IKs if KvLQT1 is indeed the major molecular component of this current. To test this idea, we created the adenovirus AdRMGI-KvLQT1-G306R, which overexpresses KvLQT1-G306R channels. In > 60 % of neonatal mouse myocytes, a sizable IKs could be measured using perforated-patch recordings (8.0 +/- 1.6 pA pF-1, n = 13). IKs was increased by forskolin and blocked by clofilium or indapamide but not by E-4031. While cells infected with a reporter virus expressing only green fluorescent protein (GFP) displayed IKs similar to that in uninfected cells, AdRMGI-KvLQT1-G306R-infected cells showed a significantly reduced IKs (2.4 +/- 1.1 pA pF-1, n = 10, P < 0.01) when measured 60-72 h after infection. Similar results were observed in adult guinea-pig myocytes (5.9 +/- 1.2 pA pF-1, n = 9, for control vs. 0.1 +/- 0.1 pA pF-1, n = 5, for AdRMGI-KvLQT1-G306R-infected cells). We conclude that KvLQT1 is the major molecular component of IKs. Our results further establish a dominant-negative mechanism for the G306R LQT syndrome mutation.
23605695	CHEMICALNOTIN: A Review of Its Use in Cushing's Disease. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN(Â®)) is a new subcutaneous CHEMICALNOTIN analogue that acts via GENEIN to inhibit the secretion of GENEIN from the pituitary adenoma in patients with Cushing's disease. CHEMICALIN has a receptor binding profile that is distinct from that of other CHEMICALNOTIN analogues, binding with high affinity to GENEIN, which is strongly over expressed in corticotroph adenoma cells. CHEMICALNOTIN is the first pituitary-directed agent to be approved for use in Cushing's disease. In a phase III clinical trial in patients with Cushing's disease, twice-daily CHEMICALNOTIN 600 or 900Â Î¼g for 6Â months led to normalization of urinary free CHEMICALNOTIN (UFC) levels in up to a quarter of all patients (primary endpoint) and significantly reduced mean UFC levels. The reduction in UFC levels is rapid (within one to two months) and sustained (up to 24Â months). Most patients who do not have an early response to CHEMICALNOTIN do not respond at a later time point. Decreases in UFC levels achieved during CHEMICALNOTIN treatment are accompanied by decreases in serum and salivary CHEMICALNOTIN levels, as well as improvements in clinical signs and symptoms, including body weight, blood pressure and health-related quality-of-life. CHEMICALNOTIN has a generally similar tolerability profile to that of other CHEMICALNOTIN analogues, but is associated with a relatively high incidence of hyperglycaemia, requiring the addition or intensification of CHEMICALNOTIN-lowering medication in a substantial proportion of patients. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN, together with on-going patient monitoring, provides a promising new option for the medical management of Cushing's disease.
23017388	CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN suppresses the proliferation of human colon cancer cells and induces apoptosis by modulating the GENEIN/GENEIN signalling pathway. Pulsatilla koreana has been used as a traditional medicine for the treatment of several diseases. The purpose of this study was to determine if CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN isolated from the root of P. koreana inhibits the progression of colon cancer. We found that CHEMICALNOTIN strongly suppressed the growth and proliferation of colon cancer cells and induced their apoptosis. Also, CHEMICALIN showed anti-angiogenic activity by decreasing the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN. These results were confirmed by an in vivo study showing that CHEMICALNOTIN significantly inhibited tumor growth by the induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis with stronger anticancer activity than CHEMICALNOTIN. When further examined for its anticancer mechanism, CHEMICALIN effectively suppressed the GENEIN/GENEIN pathway both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, our study demonstrated that CHEMICALIN inhibits the GENEIN/GENEIN pathway, leading to the suppression of tumor growth and angiogenesis together with induction of apoptosis. Therefore, CHEMICALNOTIN is a good candidate as a natural product for use in the treatment of colon cancer.
15777622	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) safeguards pig proximal tubular LLC-PK1 cells against reduction in GENEIN activity induced by CHEMICALIN. Megalin, a family of GENEIN related to the GENEIN, is a major pathway for proximal tubular CHEMICALIN accumulation. We previously reported that CHEMICALIN antibiotics reduce GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN transport in pig proximal tubular epithelial LLC-PK1 cells in parallel with the order of their nephrotoxicity. In this study, using a model of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-induced reduction in GENEIN activity, we examined whether ligands for megalin protect LLC-PK1 cells from the CHEMICALIN-induced reduction in GENEIN activity. We employed GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN as ligands for megalin. Then the cells were treated with various concentrations of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN with or without 100 microg/ml of CHEMICALNOTIN, and the GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) uptake and levels of GENENOTIN expression were determined. As a result, we demonstrated that the GENENOTIN significantly protects these cells from CHEMICALIN-induced reduction in CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, but neither GENEIN nor GENEIN does. In accord with a rise in CHEMICALNOTIN uptake activity, the mRNA and protein levels of GENENOTIN were apparently up-regulated in the presence of GENENOTIN. Furthermore, we found that the uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN is decreased by GENENOTIN, and that GENENOTIN showed obvious protection against the CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) release from LLC-PK1 cells. Thus, these results indicate that GENENOTIN could be a valuable tool for the prevention of CHEMICALNOTIN nephrotoxicity.
2877081	Actions of CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN antagonist, on gastric acid secretion in dogs, rats and frogs. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a selective GENEIN antagonist, is a potent inhibitor of gastric acid secretion. It was 17.8 times as active as CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN (10(-5) M)-induced secretion from the isolated gastric mucosa of the bullfrog. CHEMICALNOTIN was 8.9 times as active as CHEMICALNOTIN on basal acid secretion of the chronic gastric fistula rats after s.c. administration. Against acid secretion from the vagally innervated gastric fistula and Heidenhain pouch of dogs stimulated with submaximal doses of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN was, respectively, 6.5, 5 and 4.7 times as active as CHEMICALNOTIN by i.v. administration. CHEMICALNOTIN was very well absorbed from the gut and was 5 to 10 times as active as CHEMICALNOTIN on gastric acid secretion of dogs induced by submaximal and maximal doses of CHEMICALNOTIN when given p.o. Equal molar doses of CHEMICALNOTIN showed equal peak effects when given i.v., s.c. or i.m. Pharmacological data indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN is safe and effective as an agent for the control of excessive gastric acid secretion.
23172777	3D-QSAR-assisted drug design: identification of a potent CHEMICALIN-based GENEIN inhibitor. We describe the 3D-QSAR-assisted design of an GENENOTIN inhibitor with improved physicochemical properties, inâvitro activity, and inâvivo pharmacokinetic profiles over those of the initial lead. Three different 3D-QSAR models were built and validated by using a set of 66 CHEMICALIN (ModelâI) and CHEMICALIN (ModelâII) compounds with IC(50) values toward GENEIN ranging from 33ânM to 10.5âÎ¼M. The best 3D-QSAR model, ModelâIII, constructed with 24 training set compounds from both series, showed robustness (r(2) (CV) =0.54 and 0.52 for CoMFA and CoMSIA, respectively) and superior predictive capacity for 42 test set compounds (R(2) (pred) =0.52 and 0.67, CoMFA and CoMSIA). Superimposition of CoMFA and CoMSIA ModelâIII over the crystal structure of GENENOTIN suggests the potential to improve the activity of the ligands by decreasing the steric clash with Val147 and Leu139 and by increasing hydrophobic contact with Leu139 and Gly216 residues in the solvent-exposed region of the enzyme. Based on these suggestions, the rational redesign of CHEMICALIN 24 (clogâP=7.41; GENEIN IC(50) =43ânM; HCT-116 IC(50) =400ânM) led to the identification of CHEMICALIN 67 (clogâP=5.28; GENEIN IC(50) =25ânM; HCT-116 IC(50) =23ânM). Rat inâvivo pharmacokinetic studies showed that 67 has better systemic exposure after i.v. administration than 24, and holds potential for further development.
23585058	GENENOTIN Activation Down-Regulates Expression of GENENOTIN in Cultured Hippocampal Neurons. Neurosteroids are endogenous allosteric modulators of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and enhance GENENOTIN-mediated inhibition. However, GENENOTIN expressed on hippocampal dentate granule neurons of epileptic animals are modified such that their neurosteroid sensitivity is reduced and Î´ subunit expression is diminished. The molecular mechanisms triggering this GENENOTIN plasticity were explored. In the cultured hippocampal neurons treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN (10 Î¼M) for 48 hrs reduced surface expression of Î´ and Î±4 subunits, but did not increase expression of Î³2 subunits. The tonic current recorded from neurons in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated cultures was reduced, and its neurosteroid modulation was also diminished. In contrast, synaptic inhibition and its modulation by neurosteroids were preserved in these neurons. The time course of CHEMICALNOTIN effects on surface and total Î´ subunit expression were distinct; shorter (6 hrs) treatment decreased surface expression, whereas longer treatment reduced both surface and total expression. CHEMICALNOTIN blocked CHEMICALNOTIN effects on Î´ subunit expression. Chelation of CHEMICALNOTIN ions by CHEMICALNOTIN or blockade of GENEIN activation by CHEMICALIN also prevented the CHEMICALNOTIN effects. Thus prolonged activation of GENENOTIN in hippocampal neurons reduced GENEIN expression through CHEMICALIN entry and at least in part by GENENOTIN activation.
23578644	Conjugated linoleic acid and calcium co-supplementation improves bone health in ovariectomised mice. Osteoporosis is a significant health concern for the elderly; conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) has been shown to improve overall bone mass when calcium is included as a co-supplement. However, potential effects of CLA and calcium on bone mass during a period of bone loss have not been reported. The purpose of this study was to determine how dietary calcium modulates the effects of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) in preventing bone loss, using an ovariectomised mouse model. CLA supplementation significantly prevented ovariectomy-associated weight and fat mass gain, compared to non-supplemented controls. CLA significantly increased bone markers without major changes in bone mineral composition in the femur compared to respective controls. CLA treatment increased serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) significantly (p=0.0172), while serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 concentration was not changed by CLA. Meanwhile, CLA significantly reduced femur tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activity, suggesting potential reduction of osteoclastogenesis. The data suggest that CLA, along with dietary calcium, has great potential to be used to prevent bone loss and weight gain associated with menopause.
23332447	Testosterone deficiency induces markedly decreased serum triglycerides, increased small dense LDL, and hepatic steatosis mediated by dysregulation of lipid assembly and secretion in mice fed a high-fat diet. OBJECTIVE: Although low serum testosterone (T) is associated with metabolic disorders, the mechanism of this association is unclear. The objective of the present study was to investigate the combined effects of T deficiency and a high-fat diet (HFD) on hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice. MATERIALS/METHODS: Orchiectomized (ORX) mice and sham-operated (SHAM) mice were randomly divided into five groups: SHAM mice fed a standard diet (SD), SHAM mice fed HFD, ORX mice fed SD, ORX mice fed HFD, and ORX mice fed HFD with T supplementation. After 4weeks of treatment, we investigated the synthesis and secretion of lipids in the liver and detailed serum lipoprotein profiles in each group. RESULTS: ORX mice fed HFD showed increased hepatic steatosis, markedly decreased serum triglyceride (TG) and TG-VLDL content, and increased serum very small-LDL content. Gene expression analysis revealed that ORX mice fed HFD showed significantly decreased expression of microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, lipin-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-Î± and PPAR-Î³ coactivator 1-Î±, and significantly increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1, diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 and fatty acid synthase. Reduction of hepatic AMPK phosphorylation was observed in ORX mice fed HFD. These perturbations in ORX mice fed HFD were normalized to the levels of SHAM mice fed HFD by T supplementation. CONCLUSION: T deficiency is associated with failure of lipid homeostasis mediated by altered expression of genes involved in hepatic assembly and secretion of lipids.
23305949	Two distinct mechanisms of Topoisomerase 1-dependent mutagenesis in yeast. Topoisomerase 1 (Top1) resolves transcription-associated supercoils by generating transient single-strand breaks in DNA. Top1 activity in yeast is a major source of transcription-associated mutagenesis, generating a distinctive mutation signature characterized by deletions in short, tandem repeats. A similar signature is associated with the persistence of ribonucleoside monophosphates (rNMPs) in DNA, and it also depends on Top1 activity. There is only partial overlap, however, between Top1-dependent deletion hotspots identified in highly transcribed DNA and those associated with rNMPs, suggesting the existence of both rNMP-dependent and rNMP-independent events. Here, we present genetic studies confirming that there are two distinct types of hotspots. Data suggest a novel model in which rNMP-dependent hotspots are generated by sequential Top1 reactions and are consistent with rNMP-independent hotspots reflecting processing of a trapped Top1 cleavage complex.
18162179	Covalent modification of GENENOTIN by CCNU determined by FTMS analysis of modified proteins and tryptic peptides. Chemical modification of proteins is often carried out to generate protein-small molecule conjugates for various applications. The high resolution and mass accuracy of a Fourier transform mass spectrometer is particularly useful for assessing the extent or sites of covalent modifications. As protein-small molecule reactions often produce products with variable numbers of the compound incorporated at different sites, a direct mass analysis of the reaction products at times yields mass spectra hard to interpret. Chromatographic separation at protein level could reduce the complexity of a sample, thus allowing more accurate mass spectrometric analysis. In this report, we demonstrate the utility of reversed-phase protein chromatography and FT-ICR mass spectrometry in analyzing CCNU (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, MW: 233.7Da) modification of GENEIN. With this combined approach, we determined the stoichiometry as well as sites of CCNU incorporation into the protein, demonstrating differential reactivity of several lysyl residues to CCNU alkylation.
19549602	CHEMICALIN is a GENEIN and GENEIN receptor agonist that promotes GENEIN/GENEIN heterodimerization and has potent neurotrophic activity. GENENOTIN, the cognate ligands for the GENENOTIN, are homodimers and induce GENENOTIN dimerization through a symmetric bivalent mechanism. We report here that CHEMICALIN, an antidepressant drug, directly binds GENEIN and GENEIN and triggers their dimerization and activation. CHEMICALIN, but not any other CHEMICALIN or selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, promotes GENEIN autophosphorylation in primary neurons and induces neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells. CHEMICALIN binds the extracellular domain of both GENEIN and GENEIN and promotes GENEIN-GENEIN receptor heterodimerization. Truncation of CHEMICALIN binding motif on GENEIN abrogates the receptor dimerization by CHEMICALIN. Administration of CHEMICALNOTIN to mice activates both receptors and significantly reduces CHEMICALNOTIN-triggered neuronal cell death. Inhibition of GENENOTIN, but not GENENOTIN, abolishes amitriptyline's neuroprotective effect without impairing its antidepressant activity. Thus, CHEMICALIN acts as a GENEIN and GENEIN agonist and possesses marked neurotrophic activity.
14737100	Truncated GENENOTIN receptor (GENENOTIN) is regulated by GENENOTIN through heterodimer formation with GENEIN yet remains sensitive to the dual GENENOTIN/GENEIN kinase inhibitor CHEMICALIN. The expression of the CHEMICALIN terminally truncated GENEIN receptor (GENEIN) in breast cancer correlates with metastatic disease progression compared with the expression of full-length GENENOTIN. We now show that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), but not GENENOTIN, stimulates GENENOTIN phosphorylation in BT474 breast cancer cells. Furthermore, GENENOTIN forms heterodimers with GENENOTIN, but not GENENOTIN, while GENENOTIN heterodimerizes with both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. The predilection of GENENOTIN to heterodimerize with GENENOTIN provides an explanation for its regulation by GENENOTIN, an GENENOTIN ligand. CHEMICALIN, a reversible small molecule inhibitor of GENEIN and GENEIN GENEIN, inhibits baseline GENEIN phosphorylation in BT474 cells and tumor xenografts. Inhibition of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN phosphorylation by CHEMICALIN resulted in the inhibition of downstream phospho-GENEIN, phospho-GENEIN, and GENEIN steady-state protein levels. Increased phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN in response to GENENOTIN was abrogated to varying degrees by CHEMICALIN. In contrast, trastuzumab did not inhibit GENENOTIN phosphorylation or the expression of downstream phospho-GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, or GENENOTIN. It is tempting to speculate that trastuzumab resistance may be mediated in part by the selection of GENENOTIN-expressing breast cancer cells capable of exerting potent growth and prosurvival signals through GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN heterodimers. Thus, GENEIN represents a target for therapeutic intervention, and one that is sensitive to CHEMICALIN therapy.
17409426	Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs induce colorectal cancer cell apoptosis by suppressing GENENOTIN. To determine the role of GENENOTIN in colorectal cancer apoptosis induced by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), we evaluated the effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN expression in colorectal cancer cells. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN in HT-29 and DLD-1 cells in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. CHEMICALNOTIN at 600 mumol/L inhibited 14-3-3epsilon protein expression in HT-29. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, exerted a similar effect as CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN suppressed 14-3-3epsilon promoter activity. As GENENOTIN activation is mediated by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), we determined the correlation between GENENOTIN inhibition and GENENOTIN suppression by NSAIDs. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN protein expression and GENEIN transcriptional activity. Overexpression of GENENOTIN by adenoviral transfer rescued GENEIN proteins from elimination by CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. NSAID-induced GENENOTIN suppression was associated with reduced GENENOTIN with elevation of GENENOTIN and increase in apoptosis which was rescued by Ad-GENENOTIN transduction. Stable expression of GENENOTIN in HT-29 significantly protected cells from apoptosis. Our findings shed light on a novel mechanism by which NSAIDs induce colorectal cancer apoptosis via the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN transcriptional pathway. These results suggest that GENENOTIN is a target for the prevention and therapy of colorectal cancer.
15795320	Cellular and pharmacogenetics foundation of synergistic interaction of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in human non-small-cell lung cancer cells. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN are effective agents in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and the present study investigates cellular and genetic aspects of their interaction against A549, Calu-1, and Calu-6 cells. Cells were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and their interaction was assessed using the combination index. The role of drug metabolism in CHEMICALNOTIN cytotoxicity was examined with inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, whereas the role of pemetrexed targets, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in drug chemosensitivity was analyzed in cytotoxicity rescue studies. The effect of CHEMICALIN and pemetrexed on GENEIN phosphorylation was investigated with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, whereas quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to study target gene-expression profiles and its modulation by each drug. Synergistic cytotoxicity was demonstrated, and CHEMICALIN significantly decreased the amount of GENEIN, enhanced apoptosis, and increased the expression of GENEIN in A549 and Calu-6 cells, as well as the expression of the GENEIN (GENEIN) in all cell lines. PCR demonstrated a correlation between GENEIN expression and CHEMICALIN sensitivity, whereas expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN was predictive of CHEMICALNOTIN chemosensitivity. These data demonstrated that 1) CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN synergistically interact against NSCLC cells through the suppression of GENEIN phosphorylation and induction of apoptosis; 2) the gene expression profile of critical genes may predict for drug chemosensitivity; and 3) CHEMICALIN enhances GENEIN and GENEIN expression, thus suggesting the role of gene-expression modulation for rational development of chemotherapy combinations.
12850267	Tissue expression and translational control of GENENOTINe/GENENOTIN mRNAs. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is an endogenous GENEIN antagonist at the level of the different GENEIN. One of the enzymes responsible for the production of CHEMICALIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), also catalyses the reversible transamination of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN (GENEIN, GENEIN). The enzyme exists in a cytosolic and in a mitochondrial form because of the presence of two different GENENOTIN mRNAs coding for a protein respectively with and without GENENOTIN targeting the protein into mitochondria. We have cloned from a phage library of rat kidney cDNA four new GENENOTIN cDNAs containing different GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). One of the transcripts (+14GENENOTIN cDNA) contains an alternative site of initiation of translation. The tissue distribution of the different transcripts was studied by RT-PCR. The study demonstrated that several GENENOTIN mRNAs are constitutively expressed in ubiquitous manner, while +14GENENOTIN mRNA is present only in kidney. The translational efficiency of the different transcripts was studied in vitro and enzymatic activities were measured in transiently transfected Cos-1 cells. Each GENENOTIN mRNA exhibits a different in vitro translational efficiency, which corresponds to different levels of GENENOTIN enzymatic activity in transfected cells. Both findings correlate with the predicted accessibility of the ribosomal binding sites of the different mRNAs. The structure of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN gene was also studied. The expression of several GENENOTIN mRNAs with different GENENOTIN represents an interesting example of transcriptional/translational control on the expression of GENENOTIN.
23628791	Down-regulation of GENENOTIN in control and GENENOTIN transfected HEK cells increases CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative stress and cell toxicity. The extra-pyramidal symptoms associated with CHEMICALNOTIN often overlap with that seen in Parkinsonism suggesting a common link between the two disorders. Since wide deviations are observed in susceptibility and characteristics of the symptoms observed in CHEMICALNOTIN, these differences may be due to underlying genetic variability. Genes linked to early onset of Parkinsonism which includes GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN have already been suggested to promote development of CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity. Of the other Parkinson-linked genes, mutations in GENENOTIN, an autosomal dominant gene, represent another likely candidate involved in the development of CHEMICALNOTIN. In this paper the effect of shRNA GENENOTIN knock-down on CHEMICALIN toxicity was examined in control and GENEIN transfected HEK293 cells. Results demonstrate that GENENOTIN down-regulation potentiates CHEMICALIN toxicity in both control and GENEIN-transfected cell as well as potentiates DA toxicity. Combined treatment of CHEMICALIN and DA further augments cell toxicity, ROS production and GENEIN phosphorylation in GENENOTIN deficient cells compared to controls. Consistent with studies demonstrating that GENENOTIN plays a role in the phosphorylation of GENENOTIN, our results similarly demonstrate a decrease in GENENOTIN activation in GENENOTIN knock-down cells. Our findings suggest that null mutations in GENENOTIN which cause Parkinsonism potentiate CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity and increase susceptibility to develop CHEMICALNOTIN.
22983867	Swim training of CHEMICALNOTIN-obese mice improves the impaired GENEIN CHEMICALIN phosphorylation in pancreatic islets. The goal of the present study was to investigate changes on CHEMICALNOTIN homoeostasis and of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) signalling in pancreatic islets from CHEMICALNOTIN-obese mice submitted to or not submitted to swim training. Swim training of 90-day-old CHEMICALNOTIN mice was used to evaluate whether signalling pathways of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in islets are involved with the GENENOTIN resistance and CHEMICALNOTIN intolerance observed in this obese animal model. The results showed that GENEIN CHEMICALIN phosphorylation (GENEIN) was reduced by 42Â % in CHEMICALIN-obese mice (CHEMICALIN, 6.7Â Â±Â 0.2Â arbitrary units (a.u.); control, 11.5Â Â±Â 0.4Â a.u.); on the other hand, exercise training increased GENEIN by 76Â % in CHEMICALIN mice without affecting control mice (CHEMICALIN, 11.8Â Â±Â 0.3; control, 12.8Â Â±Â 0.2Â a.u.). Although the treatment with CHEMICALIN increased GENEIN CHEMICALIN phosphorylation (GENEIN) by 96Â % (CHEMICALIN, 17.02Â Â±Â 0.6; control, 8.7Â Â±Â 0.2Â a.u.), exercise training also increased it in both groups (control, 13.6Â Â±Â 0.1; CHEMICALIN, 22.2Â Â±Â 1.1Â a.u.). Current research shows that the practice of swim training increases the CHEMICALIN phosphorylation of GENEIN which can modulate the effect caused by obesity in GENENOTIN.
12614192	Long-term use of CHEMICALNOTIN. The treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) has been revolutionised by new agents to inhibit the enzyme GENENOTIN. The scientific basis of this treatment of ED includes relaxation of the corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tissue by inhibition of GENEIN that breaks down CHEMICALIN, the key pathway for the production of erectile function in humans. Many clinical studies, both pre- and post-marketing, have demonstrated the clinical efficacy and safety of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, Pfizer) - the first approved selective GENEIN inhibitor for the treatment of ED. CHEMICALIN is inhibitory of GENEIN at a rate tenfold higher than for the next GENEIN (GENEIN), which produces visual changes through the retinal rods. Its clinical effectiveness has been well documented in the majority of men with ED irrespective of aetiology. The aetiology of ED, also, does not appear to effect the function of CHEMICALNOTIN in relaxing corpus cavernosum smooth muscle tissue. Adverse events are usually associated with the vascular changes from GENENOTIN inhibition. These include headache and flushing. Each of these adverse events, however, declines with medication use. With the use of CHEMICALIN, it has been clearly, clinically demonstrated that the selective inhibition of GENEIN is an appropriate, effective, safe method for the treatment of ED of all aetiologies and severities.
17545671	GENEIN, a new partner in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis and an atypical target of CHEMICALIN. We show that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is involved in adipocyte glyceroneogenesis, a regulated pathway that controls CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis by promoting CHEMICALNOTIN formation for CHEMICALNOTIN re-esterification during fasting. GENEIN activity, as well as the incorporation of CHEMICALNOTIN into the neutral lipid fraction of 3T3-GENENOTIN adipocytes was stimulated by the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) CHEMICALIN. Conversely, the ratio of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN released into the medium decreased. Regulation of GENENOTIN gene expression was specific to differentiated adipocytes and did not require any GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN direct binding. Nevertheless, GENEIN is indirectly necessary for both GENENOTIN basal expression and CHEMICALIN responsiveness because they are, respectively, diminished and abolished by ectopic overexpression of a dominant negative GENENOTIN. The GENEIN CHEMICALIN-responsive site was restricted to a single CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN located at -381 to -376 bp whose mutation impaired the specific GENENOTIN binding. GENEIN ectopic expression activated the GENEIN gene transcription in absence of CHEMICALNOTIN, and its protein amount in nuclear extracts is 1.8-fold increased by CHEMICALIN treatment of adipocytes. Finally, the amounts of GENEIN and GENEIN mRNAs were similarly increased by CHEMICALIN treatment of human adipose tissue explants, confirming coordinated regulation. Our data identify GENEIN as a new member of glyceroneogenesis, transcriptionally regulated by CHEMICALIN via the control of GENEIN expression by GENEIN in adipocytes.
23291630	CHEMICALIN, a potent and selective GENEIN inhibitor, achieves antitumor activity while sparing platelets. Proteins in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) family are key regulators of the apoptotic process. This family comprises proapoptotic and prosurvival proteins, and shifting the balance toward the latter is an established mechanism whereby cancer cells evade apoptosis. The therapeutic potential of directly inhibiting prosurvival proteins was unveiled with the development of CHEMICALIN, a selective inhibitor of both GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN), which has shown clinical efficacy in some GENENOTIN-dependent hematological cancers. However, concomitant on-target thrombocytopenia caused by GENENOTIN inhibition limits the efficacy achievable with this agent. Here we report the re-engineering of CHEMICALIN to create a highly potent, orally bioavailable and GENEIN-selective inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. This compound inhibits the growth of GENENOTIN-dependent tumors in vivo and spares human platelets. A single dose of CHEMICALNOTIN in three patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia resulted in tumor lysis within 24 h. These data indicate that selective pharmacological inhibition of GENENOTIN shows promise for the treatment of GENENOTIN-dependent hematological cancers.
23618901	GENENOTIN mediates cigarette smoke extract (CSE) induction of GENENOTIN release by human fetal lung fibroblasts. Cigarette smoke is the major cause of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), yet pathogenic mechanisms are not fully understood. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is one of the major regulators of endothelial cell survival and is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of COPD. Fibroblasts are a significant source of GENENOTIN in the lungs; however the effect of cigarette smoke exposure on GENENOTIN release by fibroblasts is not fully understood. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke-induced disturbed GENENOTIN release by human lung fibroblasts is a potential pathogenic mechanism that could contribute to COPD. Cigarette smoke extract (CSE) was prepared by modification of the methods of Carp and Janoff (American Review of Respiratory Disease, 1978). Human fetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) were exposed to different concentrations of CSE and for different durations. GENENOTIN release into the media was measured using ELISA. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN as a potential pathway for CSE modulated GENENOTIN release was also investigated using biochemical analyses and siRNA inhibition of GENENOTIN and siRNA and pharmacologic inhibition of GENENOTIN. CSE induced GENENOTIN release by HFL-1 in concentration and time dependent manner. This was confirmed in two additional types of primary human fetal lung fibroblasts. CSE induced GENENOTIN phosphorylation and nuclear translocation in HFL-1 cells. Silencing of GENENOTIN by siRNA not only eliminated the stimulatory effect of CSE on GENENOTIN release but also inhibited baseline GENENOTIN production. Suppression of GENEIN by the pharmacological inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) markedly reduced GENEIN release by HFL-1 in response to CSE and this effect was confirmed by GENENOTIN siRNA. In contrast, nicotine inhibited GENENOTIN release by HFL-1 in a dose and time dependent manner. Our findings indicate that CSE stimulates GENENOTIN-mediated GENENOTIN release by lung fibroblasts. CHEMICALIN does not account for the CSE stimulation of GENEIN in HFL-1. The ability of lung fibroblasts to produce GENENOTIN may play a role in pathogenesis of cigarette smoke induced lung disease.
23348500	A novel GENENOTIN positive allosteric modulator acts at a unique site and confers stimulus bias to GENENOTIN signaling. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a target for the treatment of central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, GENENOTIN has been shown to play an important role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity, specifically in long-term depression (LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP), which is thought to be involved in cognition. Multiple GENENOTIN-positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) have been developed from a variety of different scaffolds. Previous work has extensively characterized a common allosteric site on GENEIN, termed the CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binding site. However, one GENEIN PAM, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), interacts with a separate allosteric site on GENEIN. Using cell-based assays and brain slice preparations, we characterized the interaction of a potent and efficacious GENEIN PAM from the CHEMICALIN series termed CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). CHEMICALIN binds to the CHEMICALIN site on GENEIN and potentiates GENEIN-mediated responses in both recombinant and native systems. However, CHEMICALIN provides greater GENEIN subtype selectivity than does CHEMICALIN, making it more suitable for studies of effects on GENEIN in CNS preparations. Of interest, CHEMICALNOTIN does not potentiate responses involved in hippocampal synaptic plasticity (LTD/LTP), setting it apart from other previously characterized CHEMICALNOTIN site PAMs. This suggests that although GENENOTIN PAMs may have similar responses in some systems, they can induce differential effects on GENENOTIN-mediated physiologic responses in the CNS. Such stimulus bias by GENENOTIN PAMs may complicate drug discovery efforts but would also allow for specifically tailored therapies, if pharmacological biases can be attributed to different therapeutic outcomes.
11961111	GENENOTIN as direct targets of inhaled anesthetics. The molecular pharmacology of inhalational anesthetics remains poorly understood. Despite accumulating evidence suggesting that neuronal membrane proteins are potential targets of inhaled anesthetics, most currently favored membrane protein targets lack any direct evidence for anesthetic binding. We report herein the location of the binding site for the inhaled anesthetic CHEMICALIN at the CHEMICALIN residue level of resolution in the ligand binding cavity in a prototypical GENEIN, GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN fluorescence quenching and direct photoaffinity labeling with CHEMICALNOTIN suggested an interhelical location of CHEMICALNOTIN with a stoichiometry of 1 (CHEMICALNOTIN/rhodopsin molar ratio). Radiosequence analysis of CHEMICALIN-labeled GENEIN revealed that CHEMICALNOTIN contacts an CHEMICALIN residue (Trp265) lining the ligand binding cavity in the transmembrane core of the receptor. The predicted functional consequence, competition between CHEMICALNOTIN and the ligand retinal, was shown here by spectroscopy and is known to exist in vivo. These data suggest that competition with endogenous ligands may be a general mechanism of the action of CHEMICALNOTIN at this large family of signaling proteins.
10462128	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on extracellular concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in the rat frontal cortex: augmentation via GENENOTIN receptor antagonism. CHEMICALNOTIN is a novel CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) which has been shown clinically to be an effective antidepressant (AD) with a faster onset of action than CHEMICALNOTIN specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRI). Preclinically, CHEMICALIN has been shown to potently inhibit dorsal raphe neuronal (DRN) firing through a GENEIN mediated mechanism, in a similar manner to SSRIs. Here we demonstrate the acute neurochemical effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on extracellular concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) from the rat frontal cortex using in vivo microdialysis. Administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (3-50 mg/kg s.c.) resulted in a significant dose-dependent increase in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN, but produced no significant increase in CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations. Combination treatment with the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN produced a dose-dependent augmentation of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced (3-30 mg/kg s.c) extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations, but had no further effect on CHEMICALNOTIN above that produced by CHEMICALNOTIN alone. CHEMICALNOTIN, at doses as low as 0.03 mg/kg s.c., maintained this potentiation effect. The beta-adrenergic/GENEIN receptor antagonist CHEMICALIN and the selective GENENOTIN antagonist CHEMICALNOTIN produced no significant augmentation of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced changes in either CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Using the GENENOTIN antagonists, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, we also demonstrate the role of the GENEIN in the augmentation of CHEMICALIN-induced changes. The possible mechanisms underlying CHEMICALNOTIN improved clinical AD action and the potential for further enhancement of this SNRIs clinical effects are discussed.
12724156	GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, seizures, and the amygdala. The amygdala is a critical brain region for limbic seizure activity, but the mechanisms underlying its epileptic susceptibility are obscure. Several lines of evidence implicate GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) GENENOTIN, a type of GENENOTIN, in the amygdala's vulnerability to seizures and epileptogenesis. GENENOTIN mRNA is abundant in temporal lobe structures including the amygdala. Brain slice recordings indicate that GENENOTIN GENENOTIN mediate a portion of the synaptic excitation of neurons in the rat basolateral amygdala. Whole-cell voltage-clamp studies demonstrate that GENENOTIN GENENOTIN-mediated synaptic currents are inwardly rectifying and are likely to be CHEMICALNOTIN permeable. Prolonged activation of basolateral amygdala GENENOTIN GENENOTIN results in enduring synaptic facilitation through a CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent process. The selective GENENOTIN GENENOTIN agonist ATPA induces spontaneous epileptiform bursting that is sensitive to the GENEIN GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN. Intra-amygdala infusion of ATPA in the rat induces limbic status epilepticus; in some animals, recurrent spontaneous seizures occur for months after the ATPA treatment. Together, these observations indicate that GENENOTIN GENENOTIN have a unique role in triggering epileptiform activity in the amygdala and could participate in long-term plasticity mechanisms that underlie some forms of epileptogenesis. Accordingly, GENENOTIN GENENOTIN represent a potential target for antiepileptic and antiepileptogenic drug treatments. Most antiepileptic drugs do not act through effects on GENENOTIN. However, CHEMICALIN at low concentrations causes slow inhibition of GENEIN GENEIN-mediated synaptic currents in the basolateral amygdala, indicating that it may protect against seizures, at least in part, through suppression of GENEIN GENEIN responses.
22899102	GENEIN are involved in the transport of the CHEMICALIN conjugates of the ultimate carcinogen of CHEMICALNOTIN in human Caco-2 cells. A wide variety of contaminants are ingested through food, among them the pro-carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon CHEMICALNOTIN (BP) that is resorbed and partially metabolized in the enterocytes of the small intestine. Previous in vitro studies have revealed that CHEMICALNOTIN are excreted as Phase II metabolites including glucuronides and CHEMICALNOTIN. This export is mediated by the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The ultimate carcinogenic Phase I BP metabolite anti-CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) can be detoxified by CHEMICALIN conjugate formation catalyzed by GENEIN. In the present study, differentiated human intestinal Caco-2 cells were used as a model for the human small intestine to investigate the detoxification of CHEMICALNOTIN and excretion of stereoisomeric CHEMICALNOTIN conjugates in the presence of an inhibitor of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN at the cell surface. The results indicate that the CHEMICALNOTIN conjugates of CHEMICALNOTIN are formed and excreted mainly to the apical and to a minor extent to the basolateral side of polarized Caco-2 monolayers. Inhibition studies revealed that the GENEIN (GENEIN) are involved in the transport of CHEMICALIN conjugates. Stable GENEIN, GENEIN and GENENOTIN knockdown cell lines were generated, thus making it possible to demonstrate that GENEIN mediates the basolateral and GENEIN the apical excretion of CHEMICALIN conjugates. In conclusion, the ultimate carcinogen CHEMICALNOTIN is detoxified via CHEMICALNOTIN conjugation and subsequently excreted by Caco-2 cells in both apical and basolateral directions. This finding is equivalent to a transport into feces as well as blood system in the in vivo situation.
23265491	Evaluation of biological activities of a groundnut (Apios americana Medik) extract containing a novel CHEMICALNOTIN. Groundnut (Apios americana Medik) contains a novel CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN. In the present study, we examined the biological activities of an CHEMICALNOTIN extract of groundnut containing CHEMICALNOTIN as the main component. Although the groundnut extract by itself did not show antioxidative activity, it drove the antioxidative system in cells. Pretreatment of human breast carcinoma MCF-7 cells for 24 h with the groundnut extract and soybean CHEMICALIN increased gene expression of GENEIN (GENEIN), a major antioxidative stress enzyme. These groundnut extract-treated cells showed antioxidative activity against free radicals derived from a radical initiator. Pretreatment of cells with 100 Î¼g/mL groundnut extract prevented the depletion of CHEMICALNOTIN by the radical initiator; however, treatment with 100 Î¼g/mL of soybean CHEMICALNOTIN injured the cell membrane, indicating that CHEMICALNOTIN might be released to the extracellular environment. These results suggest that the groundnut extract had CHEMICALNOTIN-like activity. Like soybean, groundnuts are a good source of CHEMICALNOTIN.
16846546	Comparison of GENEIN inhibitory activity and ocular anti-inflammatory effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. OBJECTIVE: To compare the GENEIN (GENEIN) activity and anti-inflammatory effects of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). METHODS: GENEIN activity and selectivity was determined in vitro by measuring CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) production following incubation of varying concentrations of NSAID with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Anti-inflammatory effects were evaluated in a rabbit model in which an ocular inflammatory response was induced by intravenous injection of 10 microg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In study animals, one eye was treated with 50 microL CHEMICALNOTIN 0.4% (CHEMICALNOTIN) or CHEMICALNOTIN 0.09% (CHEMICALNOTIN) and the other eye with 50 microL buffered saline. In control animals, both eyes were treated with vehicle. All animals were treated twice: 2 hours and 1 hour before LPS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: CHEMICALNOTIN production in vitro, measured by enzyme immunoassay; CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-dextran leakage into the anterior chamber, measured by fluorophotometry; aqueous CHEMICALNOTIN levels in vivo, measured by ELISA immunoassay. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN was six times more active against GENEIN (IC(50) = 0.02 microM) than GENEIN (IC(50) = 0.12 microM) while CHEMICALIN was approximately 32 times more active against GENEIN (IC(50) = 0.0066 microM) than GENEIN (IC(50) = 0.210 microM). In the animal model, both drugs resulted in nearly complete inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-dextran leakage and CHEMICALNOTIN production in the anterior chamber of treated eyes. There was also a 79% inhibition (p < 0.001) of CHEMICALNOTIN-dextran leakage in the contralateral eyes of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated rabbits, and a 22.5% inhibition (not statistically significant) in the contralateral eyes of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated rabbits. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALIN is relatively GENEIN selective while CHEMICALIN is potently selective for GENEIN over GENEIN. In the animal model, both CHEMICALNOTIN 0.4% and CHEMICALNOTIN 0.09% demonstrated maximal anti-inflammatory activity in treated eyes. Only CHEMICALNOTIN 0.09% had a significant effect on the contralateral eye, suggesting possible systemic absorption of this drug.
18715952	Tumor-growth-promoting GENEIN CHEMICALIN pathway provides medulloblastoma therapeutic targets. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been shown to play important roles in several aspects of tumor development and progression. CHEMICALIN is synthesized from CHEMICALIN by GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) and mediates its biological activity through binding to the four GENEIN through GENEIN. In this study, we show for the first time that medulloblastoma (MB), the most common malignant childhood brain tumor, expresses high levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN through GENENOTIN and secretes CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and the GENENOTIN agonist butaprost stimulated MB cell proliferation. Treatment of MB cells with GENENOTIN inhibitors suppressed CHEMICALNOTIN production and induced GENENOTIN-dependent apoptosis. Similarly, specific GENENOTIN silencing by small interfering RNA inhibited MB cell growth. GENEIN and GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, but not the GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, inhibited tumor cell proliferation, indicating the significance of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN but not GENENOTIN for MB growth. Administration of GENENOTIN inhibitors at clinically achievable nontoxic concentrations significantly inhibited growth of established human MB xenografts. Apoptosis was increased, proliferation was reduced, and angiogenesis was inhibited in MBs treated with GENENOTIN inhibitors. This study suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN is important for MB growth and that therapies targeting the prostanoid metabolic pathway are potentially beneficial and should be tested in clinical settings for treatment of children with MB.
8646863	CHEMICALNOTIN: safety profile. CHEMICALNOTIN is a potent fluorinated corticosteroid used for the topical therapy of dermatoses and as inhalation therapy for bronchial asthma and allergic rhinitis. This agent has a good safety profile with a low propensity for systemic side effects, such as suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and a low incidence of local side effects such as pruritus, burning, or skin atrophy. The pharmacologic properties of CHEMICALIN-including high lipophilicity, high selectivity and affinity for the GENEIN, low systemic absorption, and rapid metabolism and clearance-combine to give CHEMICALNOTIN a high therapeutic index.
23259985	Bioreducible polymers as a determining factor for polyplex decomplexation rate and transfection. Polyplex formation (complexation) and gene release from the polyplexes (decomplexation) are major events in polymeric gene delivery; however, the effect of the decomplexation rate on transfection has been rarely investigated. This study employed mixed polymers of poly((L)-lysine) (PLL: MW ~7.4 kDa) and reducible PLL (RPLL) (MW ~6.7 kDa) to design decomplexation rate-controllable PLL(100-x)RPLL(x)/pDNA complexes (PRL(x) polyplexes). The transfection efficiency of a model gene (luciferase) in MCF7 and HEK293 cell lines increased with increasing x (RPLL content) in the PRL(x) polyplexes until peaking at x = 2.5 and 10, respectively, after which point transfection efficiency declined rapidly. In MCF7 cells, PRL(2.5) polyplex produced 3 or 223 times higher gene expression than PLL or RPLL polyplexes, respectively. Similarly, the transfection efficiency of PRL(10) polyplex-transfected HEK293 cells was 3.8 or 67 times higher than that of PLL or RPLL polyplexes, respectively. The transfection results were not apparently related to the particle size, surface charge, complexation/compactness, cellular uptake, or cytotoxicity of the tested polyplexes. However, the decomplexation rate varied by RPLL content in the polyplexes, which in turn influenced the gene transfection. The nuclear localization of pDNA delivered by PRL(x) polyplexes showed a similar trend to their transfection efficiencies. This study suggests that an optimum decomplexation rate may result in high nuclear localization of pDNA and transfection. Understanding in decomplexation and intracellular localization of pDNA may help develop more effective polyplexes.
18282775	GENENOTIN inhibitors delay human eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis in the absence and presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. In asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the number of eosinophils and neutrophils in the lung is increased. One described mechanism leading to the impaired clearance of these cells from the lung is the delay in their programmed cell death (apoptosis). Selective inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are under development for the treatment of lung diseases because of their anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator activity. The aim of the present study was to establish whether inhibitors of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN modulate human eosinophil or neutrophil apoptosis or GENENOTIN agonist- or GENENOTIN-afforded survival. We also evaluated whether a GENENOTIN inhibitor could modulate the effect of a CHEMICALNOTIN on eosinophil and neutrophil apoptosis. Apoptosis was measured by using the relative DNA fragmentation assay and Annexin-V binding. Inhibitors of GENEIN (CHEMICALIN; 0.1-10 microM) and GENEIN (CHEMICALIN; 0.1-10 microM) delayed spontaneous eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 25% and 15%, respectively. A combination of a GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN inhibitor (10 microM) with CHEMICALNOTIN (100 nM) further delayed eosinophil apoptosis maximally by 42-49%. In neutrophils, CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM) also decreased apoptosis with a maximal inhibition of 13%. The combination of CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (100 nM) produced a 27% inhibition of neutrophil apoptosis. Inhibitor of GENEIN (CHEMICALIN; 0.1-10 microM) did not affect eosinophil apoptosis and only slightly increased spontaneous neutrophil apoptosis. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on apoptosis was not significantly modulated by a GENENOTIN inhibitor in eosinophils or neutrophils. The present results show that selective inhibitors of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) delay eosinophil apoptosis and, thus, increase their survival in vitro. Furthermore, GENENOTIN agonists enhance the anti-apoptotic effects of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitors, suggesting that such drug combinations may prolong eosinophil and neutrophil longevity in the lung.
23578584	Significance of the transient receptor potential canonical 2 (TRPC2) channel in the regulation of rat thyroid FRTL-5 cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and invasion. Mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) channels are involved in many physiologically important processes. Here, we have studied the significance of the TRPC2 channel in the regulation of rat thyroid FRTL-5 cell proliferation, migration, adhesion and invasion, using stable TRPC2 (shTRPC2) knock-down cells. In the shTRPC2 cells, proliferation was decreased due to a prolonged G1/S cell cycle phase. The tumor suppressor p53 and the cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitors p27 and p21 were upregulated. Cell invasion, adhesion and migration were also attenuated in shTRPC2 cells, probably due to decreased activity of both Rac and calpain, and a decreased secretion and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2. The attenuated proliferation, migration, invasion and ATP-evoked calcium entry was mimicked by overexpressing a non-conducting, truncated TRPC2 (TRPC2-DN) in wild type cells, and was reversed by overexpression of TRPC2-GFP in shTRPC2 cells. In conclusion, TRPC2 is an important regulator of rat thyroid cell function.
16702329	Lutein and CHEMICALIN interact to modify GENEIN mRNA levels through the GENEIN/GENEIN pathway in chickens and HD11 cell lines. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of lutein and fat or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) interaction on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA levels. In Expt. 1, macrophages were collected from broiler chicks fed 3 or 6% dietary fat (g/100 g) with 0, 25, and 50 mg lutein/kg feed for 23 d. In Expt. 2, using a 3 x 3 factorial, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) at 0, 15 and 50 micromol/L and lutein at 0, 10 and 100 micromol/L were applied to HD11 cell culture for 24 h. In both experiments, cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide before RNA isolation. Lutein interacted with fat in Expt. 1 and with EPA in Expt. 2 to affect mRNA levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN in chicken macrophages and HD11 cells, respectively (P < 0.05). At 3% dietary fat or up to 15 micromol/L EPA in the medium, increasing lutein increased the GENENOTIN mRNA. However, at 6% dietary fat or 50 micromol/L EPA, lutein did not cause a rise in GENENOTIN mRNA. Increasing lutein in the medium from 0 to 100 micromol/L decreased GENENOTIN mRNA. Increasing lutein with high fat (6%) or EPA (15 micromol/L EPA) increased GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA levels. Lutein increased GENENOTIN mRNA levels in both macrophages (P < 0.01) and HD11 (P = 0.01) cells and GENENOTIN (P < 0.01) mRNA levels in macrophages. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist, prevented (P < 0.01) the lutein-induced GENEIN mRNA downregulation in HD11 cells. LG101208, a GENENOTIN antagonist, prevented (P < 0.01) GENENOTIN upregulation induced by 10 micromol/L lutein and GENENOTIN mRNA downregulation induced by 100 micromol/L lutein. We conclude that lutein and CHEMICALIN interact through the GENEIN and GENEIN pathways to modulate GENEIN mRNA.
17111172	Occupancy of CHEMICALNOTIN GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENEIN in schizophrenic patients treated with CHEMICALIN in comparison with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. RATIONALE: CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been used as a neuroleptic for nearly 4 decades. In vitro data show comparable affinity to GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN and recently, CHEMICALIN showed to be not inferior to CHEMICALIN in schizophrenic patients with predominant negative symptomatology, which was implicated with flupentixol's interaction with GENEIN and/or GENEIN. OBJECTIVES: To assess in vivo receptor occupancy (RO) in patients clinically treated with FLX (n = 13, 5.7 +/- 1.4 mg/day) in comparison with CHEMICALNOTIN (RIS, n = 11, 3.6 +/- 1.3 mg/day) and CHEMICALNOTIN (HAL, n = 11, 8.5 +/- 5.5 mg/day). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Each patient underwent two PET scans with CHEMICALNOTIN (target: frontal GENENOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (striatal GENENOTIN) or CHEMICALNOTIN (striatal GENENOTIN). RO was calculated as the percentage reduction of specific binding in comparison with healthy controls. RESULTS: GENENOTIN-RO under FLX was between 50% and 70%, indicating an ED(50) of about 0.7 ng/ml serum. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN-RO was 20 +/- 10% and 20 +/- 5% (mean, SEM). Under HAL, GENENOTIN-RO was 14 +/- 6% and under RIS not significantly different from zero. CONCLUSIONS: We were able to demonstrate a moderate GENEIN and GENEIN occupancy under clinically relevant doses of CHEMICALIN, albeit lower than expected from in vitro data and clearly below saturation. Therefore, if flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms is based on its interaction with GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN, it should be highly dependent on serum concentration and thus on dosage and metabolism. However, these data suggest that mechanisms other than GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN antagonism may contribute to flupentixol's efficacy on negative symptoms.
12373557	Stereospecific inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN isomers. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) comprises four stereoisomers consisting of two enantiomeric pairs related to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is transported into adrenergic neurons and radiolabeled CHEMICALNOTIN has been employed in positron emission tomography (PET) to image adrenergic neurons in vivo. To extend structure-activity analyses of binding sites within GENEIN and to determine which stereoisomer displayed the best selectivity for PET imaging applications, we tested the CHEMICALIN compounds for their abilities to inhibit [CHEMICALNOTIN]neurotransmitter uptake into platelets, transfected cells, and chromaffin vesicles. We hypothesized that the CHEMICALIN compounds would be most potent at the GENEIN (GENEIN) compared to the GENENOTIN and that the 1R diastereomers would be more effective than 1S diastereomers. Supporting the hypotheses, all stereoisomers were most potent at the GENENOTIN and the 1R,2S stereoisomer was the most potent inhibitor overall. However, the 1S,2R isomer may be preferred for PET applications because of better selectivity among the transporters and reduced neuronal recycling.
23429912	CHEMICALIN inhibition of canonical GENEIN signaling disrupts prostatic bud formation in mouse urogenital sinus. In mice, in utero exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) reduces the number of dorsolateral prostatic buds resulting in a smaller dorsolateral prostate and prevents formation of ventral buds culminating in ventral prostate agenesis. The genes and signaling pathways affected by CHEMICALNOTIN that are responsible for disrupting prostate development are largely unknown. Here we show that treatment of urogenital sinus (UGS) organ cultures with known inhibitors of canonical GENENOTIN signaling also inhibits prostatic bud formation. In support of the hypothesis that CHEMICALIN decreases canonical GENEIN signaling, we identify inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on multiple components of the canonical GENENOTIN signaling pathway in the UGS that temporally coincide with the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on prostatic bud formation: (1) expression of GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN) that promote canonical GENENOTIN signaling is reduced; (2) expression of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, established canonical GENENOTIN target genes, is decreased; (3) expression of GENEIN, a GENEIN that activates canonical GENENOTIN signaling, is reduced; and (4) expression of GENEIN (GENEIN), inhibitors of canonical GENENOTIN signaling, is not increased by CHEMICALIN. Thus, the CHEMICALIN-induced reduction in canonical GENEIN signaling is associated with a decrease in activators (GENEIN and GENEIN) rather than an increase in inhibitors (GENEIN and GENEIN) of the pathway. This study focuses on determining whether treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN-exposed UGS organ cultures with GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN is capable of rescuing the inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN on canonical GENEIN signaling and prostatic bud formation. We discovered that each GENENOTIN alone or in combination partially rescues CHEMICALIN inhibition of both canonical GENEIN signaling and prostatic bud formation.
23446230	GENENOTIN overexpression increases CHEMICALNOTIN and protects against GENENOTIN-induced abdominal aortic aneurysm in mice. GENEIN (GENEIN) metabolizes CHEMICALIN to form CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which possess various beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system. However, whether increasing CHEMICALIN production by GENEIN overexpression in vivo could prevent abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains unknown. Here we investigated the effects of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV)-mediated GENENOTIN overexpression on GENENOTIN-induced AAA in apoE-deficient mice. rAAV-GENENOTIN delivery led to an abundant aortic GENENOTIN expression and increased CHEMICALNOTIN generation. It was shown that GENENOTIN overexpression attenuated GENENOTIN expression and activity, GENENOTIN degradation, and AAA formation, which was associated with reduced aortic inflammation and macrophage infiltration. In cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), rAAV-mediated GENENOTIN overexpression and CHEMICALIN markedly suppressed GENEIN-induced inflammatory GENEIN expression. Moreover, overexpressed GENENOTIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN-induced macrophage migration in a VSMC-macrophage coculture system. We further indicated that these protective effects were mediated by GENENOTIN activation. Taken together, these results provide evidence that rAAV-mediated GENENOTIN overexpression prevents AAA development which is likely via GENENOTIN activation and anti-inflammatory action, suggesting that increasing CHEMICALNOTIN levels could be considered as a potential strategy to prevent and treat AAA.
23536521	Differential effects of organic and inorganic CHEMICALNOTIN compounds on GENENOTIN activity and scavenger capacity in cerebral cortex slices of young rats. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties and is necessary for the development and normal function of the central nervous system. This study was aimed to compare the in vitro effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (inorganic CHEMICALNOTIN) on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activity, cell viability, lipid peroxidation, scavenger of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and nonprotein CHEMICALNOTIN (NP-CHEMICALNOTIN) content in the cerebral cortex slices of the young rats. A decrease in GENEIN activity was observed when the slices were exposed to CHEMICALIN at the concentrations of 1, 10 and 30 ÂµM. The same compound showed higher scavenger capacity of CHEMICALNOTIN than the inorganic compound. Inorganic CHEMICALNOTIN was able to protect against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative damage and increased the NP-CHEMICALNOTIN content. Both the compounds displayed distinctive antioxidant capacities and were not cytotoxic for the cerebral cortex slices in the conditions tested. These findings are likely to be related to immunomodulatory and antioxidant properties of this compound.
23293129	Antigenotoxic potencies of a lichen species, Evernia prunastri. In this article, the genotoxic and antigenotoxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN extract of Evernia prunastri (Huds.) Willd. (MEP) were studied using WP2, Ames (TA1535 and TA1537) and sister chromatid exchange (SCE) test systems. The results obtained from bacterial test systems demonstrated that MEP has strong antimutagenic potencies on TA1537 and WP2 strains. The highest inhibition rates for MEP on TA1537 and WP2 strains were 37.70% and 69.70%, respectively. According to the SCE test system, MEP reduced the genotoxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN. In order to clarify the mechanism underlying the antigenotoxic effects of MEP, the antioxidants were determined. Cotreatments of 5, 10 and 20 Âµg/mL concentrations of MEP with CHEMICALIN decreased the frequencies of SCE and the CHEMICALNOTIN level and increased amount of GENEIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN which were decreased by CHEMICALIN. The data obtained from this work have clearly shown that MEP has significant antigenotoxic effects which are thought to be partly due to the antioxidant activities and antioxidant inducing capability of MEP. This is the first report indicating the antigenotoxic activities of MEP against several mutagen agents such as CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN.
23528251	Cross-talk between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in the regulation of gene expression. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN are often activated under similar physiological conditions. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) translocates into the nucleus in accordance with GENENOTIN and thus confers transactivation. The aim of the present study was to investigate a possible link between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (PB), a typical GENEIN activator, increased the gene expression of GENEIN-target genes in the livers of mice, including GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN. PB induced an accumulation of nuclear GENENOTIN and an increase in the GENENOTIN-mediated transactivation in HepG2 cells. CHEMICALIN, a typical GENEIN activator, induced the gene expression of GENEIN-target genes, including GENEIN and GENEIN, an accumulation of nuclear GENEIN and an increase in the GENEIN-mediated transactivation in the mouse liver. Immunoprecipitation-immunoblot and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses suggest that GENENOTIN binds to the GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN in the liver of untreated mice and that the complex dissociates upon PB treatment. Taken together these results suggest that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN interact and reciprocally modulate the functions of each other.
12671891	GENENOTIN subunit gene expression provides a proliferative advantage in human hepatoma. BACKGROUND & AIMS: Of the 2 genes (GENEIN, GENEIN) encoding GENEIN, the enzyme that synthesizes CHEMICALIN, GENEIN, is expressed in liver, whereas GENENOTIN is expressed in extrahepatic tissues. In liver, GENENOTIN expression associates with growth, dedifferentiation, and cancer. Here, we identified the beta subunit as a regulator of proliferation in human hepatoma cell lines. The beta subunit has been cloned and shown to lower the K(m) of GENEIN (the GENEIN product) for CHEMICALIN and to render the enzyme more susceptible to CHEMICALIN inhibition. METHODS: GENENOTIN subunit expression was analyzed in human and rat liver and hepatoma cell lines and their interaction studied in HuH7 cells. beta Subunit expression was up- and down-regulated in human hepatoma cell lines and the effect on DNA synthesis determined. RESULTS: We found that beta subunit is expressed in rat extrahepatic tissues but not in normal liver. In human liver, beta subunit expression associates with cirrhosis and hepatoma. beta Subunit is expressed in most (HepG2, PLC, and Hep3B) but not all (HuH7) hepatoma cell lines. Transfection of beta subunit reduced CHEMICALNOTIN content and stimulated DNA synthesis in HuH7 cells, whereas down-regulation of beta subunit expression diminished DNA synthesis in HepG2. The interaction between GENENOTIN subunit was demonstrated in HuH7 cells. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate that beta subunit associates with cirrhosis and cancer providing a proliferative advantage in hepatoma cells through its interaction with GENENOTIN and down-regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN levels.
16962597	Temporal profile of brain and pituitary GnRHs, GnRH-R and gonadotropin mRNA expression and content during early development in European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax L.). A likely endocrine control mechanism for sexual differentiation in size-graded populations of European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) is proposed by evaluating the brain expression and pituitary content of two forms of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), namely sea bream (sbGnRH) and salmon (sGnRH), the pituitary expression of one subtype of GnRH receptor (dlGnRH-R-2A) and the three gonadotropin (GtH) subunits, namely glycoprotein alpha (GPalpha), follicle-stimulating hormone beta (FSHbeta) and luteinizing hormone beta (LHbeta), as well as the pituitary and plasma LH levels between 50 and 300 days post-hatching (dph). Four gradings were conducted between 2 and 8 months after hatching, resulting in a population of large and small individuals, having 96.5% females (female-dominant population) and 69.2% males (male-dominant population), respectively, after the last grading. The onset of gonadal differentiation was different in the two sexes, and coincided with a peak of expression of sbGnRH or sGnRH. Furthermore, the expression of these GnRHs was correlated with the expression of dlGnRH-R-2A. Sex-related differences in the brain and pituitary content of sbGnRH were also found at the time of sexual differentiation. Moreover, the observed sexual dimorphism at the transcriptional or synthesis level of these GnRH forms suggests that a different neuro-hormonal regulation is operating according to sex. At the onset of sex differentiation, FSHbeta transcriptional activity reached maximal values, which were maintained until the completion of the process. The present study suggests a role for sbGnRH, sGnRH and the dlGnRH-R-2A during gonadal differentiation, possibly through enhancement of FSHbeta gene expression. In males, a different endocrine regulation seems to exist also during spermiogenesis and spermiation, when gene transcription, peptide synthesis and release of LH are of greater importance.
23147414	Linking GENEIN subunits to CHEMICALIN-induced conditioned taste aversion and recovery from acute CHEMICALNOTIN intoxication. GENEIN (GENEIN) are important for CHEMICALIN actions and it is of interest to link individual subunits with specific CHEMICALNOTIN behaviors. We studied null mutant mice for six different GENENOTIN). Only mice lacking the Î±2 subunit showed reduction of conditioned taste aversion (CTA) to CHEMICALNOTIN. These results are in agreement with data from knock-in mice with mutation of the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive site in the Î±2-subunit (Blednov etÂ al., 2011). All together, they indicate that aversive property of CHEMICALNOTIN is dependent on CHEMICALIN action on GENEIN. Deletion of the Î±2-subunit led to faster recovery whereas absence of the Î±3-subunit slowed recovery from CHEMICALNOTIN-induced incoordination (rotarod). Deletion of the other four subunits did not affect this behavior. Similar changes in this behavior for the Î±2 and Î±3 null mutants were found for CHEMICALNOTIN motor incoordination. However, no differences in recovery were found in motor-incoordinating effects of an Î±1-selective modulator (CHEMICALNOTIN) or an Î±4-selective agonist (CHEMICALNOTIN). Therefore, recovery of rotarod incoordination is under control of two GENENOTIN. For motor activity, Î±3 null mice demonstrated higher activation by CHEMICALNOTIN (1Â g/kg) whereas both Î±2 (-/-) and Î±3 (-/Y) knockout mice were less sensitive to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced reduction of motor activity (1.5Â g/kg). These studies demonstrate that the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN at GABAergic synapses containing Î±2 subunit are important for specific behavioral effects of CHEMICALNOTIN which may be relevant to the genetic linkage of the Î±2 subunit with human alcoholism.
23378624	Pancreatic Î²-Cell Dysfunction and Risk of New-Onset Diabetes After Kidney Transplantation. OBJECTIVEChronic exposure to calcineurin inhibitors and corticosteroids poses renal transplant recipients (RTR) at high risk for development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT). Pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction may be crucial to the pathophysiology of NODAT and specific markers for Î²-cell dysfunction may have additive value for predicting NODAT in this population. Therefore, we prospectively investigated whether proinsulin, as a marker of pancreatic Î²-cell dysfunction, is associated with future development of NODAT and improves prediction of it.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSAll RTR between 2001 and 2003 with a functioning graft for â¥1 year were considered eligible for inclusion, except for subjects with diabetes at baseline who were excluded. We recorded incidence of NODAT until April 2012.RESULTSA total of 487 RTR (age 50 Â± 12 years, 55% men) participated at a median time of 6.0 (interquartile range [IQR], 2.6-11.5) years after transplantation. Median fasting proinsulin levels were 16.6 (IQR, 11.0-24.2) pmol/L. During median follow-up for 10.1 (IQR, 9.1-10.4) years, 42 (35%) RTR had development of NODAT in the highest quartile of the distribution of proinsulin versus 34 (9%) in the lowest three quartiles (P < 0.001). In Cox regression analyses, proinsulin (hazard ratio, 2.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.85-2.83; P < 0.001) was strongly associated with NODAT development. This was independent of age, sex, calcineurine inhibitors, prednisolone use, components of the metabolic syndrome, or homeostasis model assessment.CONCLUSIONSIn conclusion, fasting proinsulin is strongly associated with NODAT development in RTR. Our results highlight the role of Î²-cell dysfunction in the pathophysiology of NODAT and indicate the potential value of proinsulin for identification of RTR at increased risk for NODAT.
23023136	CHEMICALNOTIN attenuates hepatotoxicity of rats exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an environmental pollutant and potent toxicant to humans. However, it also shows substantial anti-cancer activity in individuals with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Unfortunately, CHEMICALNOTIN-treated leukemia patients suffer hepatotoxicity. CHEMICALNOTIN has been demonstrated to have efficient antioxidant and antineoplastic activities. The study that how CHEMICALNOTIN in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN affects hepatotoxicity and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation in the liver is lacking, and the present study tackles this question. Wistar rats were injected with 3mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN on alternate days; CHEMICALNOTIN (8mg/kg) was administered 1h before CHEMICALNOTIN. Rats were killed on the 8th day to determine histological liver damage, the antioxidant enzymes in serum, the ratio of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation in the liver. In the CHEMICALIN+CHEMICALIN group, activities of GENEIN, GENEIN in serum and CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN were significantly increased, histopathological effects were reduced, and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation markedly decreased in the liver, compared with the CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN attenuated CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatotoxicity by decreasing oxidative stress and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation in the liver. These data suggest that use of CHEMICALNOTIN as post-remission therapy of APL and adjunctive therapy in patients with chronic exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN may decrease CHEMICALNOTIN hepatotoxicity.
22968082	Influence of stimulant-induced hyperactivity on social approach in the BTBR mouse model of autism. Translational research is needed to discover pharmacological targets and treatments for the diagnostic behavioral domains of autism spectrum disorders. Animal models with phenotypic relevance to diagnostic criteria offer clear experimental strategies to test the efficacy and safety of novel treatments. Antagonists of mGluR5 receptors are in clinical trials for Fragile X syndrome and under investigation for the treatment of autism spectrum disorders. However, in preclinical studies of mGluR5 compounds tested in our laboratory and others, increased locomotion following mGluR5 modulation has been observed. Understanding the influence of general activity on sociability and repetitive behaviors will increase the accuracy of interpretations of positive outcomes measured from pharmacological treatment that produces locomotor activating or sedating effects. In the present studies, dose-response curves for d-amphetamine (AMPH)-induced hyperlocomotion were similar in standard B6 mice and in the BTBR mouse model of autism. AMPH produced significant, robust reductions in the high level of repetitive self-grooming that characterizes BTBR, and also reduced the low baseline grooming in B6, indicating that AMPH-induced hyperlocomotion competes with time spent engaged in self-grooming. We then tested AMPH in B6 and BTBR on the 3-chambered social approach task. One component of sociability, the time spent in the chamber with the novel mouse, in B6 mice was reduced, while the sniffing time component of sociability in BTBR mice was enhanced. This finding replicated across multiple cohorts treated with AMPH and saline vehicle. In-depth analysis revealed that AMPH increased the number and decreased the duration of sniffing bouts in BTBR, suggesting BTBR treated with AMPH mostly engaged in brief sniffs rather than true social interactions with the novel mouse during the social approach task. Our data suggest that compounds with stimulant properties may have some direct benefits on reducing repetitive behaviors in autism spectrum disorders, particularly in the subset of autistic individuals with hyperactivity. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'Neurodevelopmental Disorders'.
23393216	Decreased serum concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN are associated with increased risk of progression to impaired fasting CHEMICALNOTIN and diabetes. OBJECTIVE To study the association between CHEMICALNOTIN status and the risk of incident impaired fasting CHEMICALNOTIN (IFG) and diabetes in a population-based cohort of diabetes-free subjects. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a historical prospective cohort study of subjects from the Clalit Health Services database, which includes information on nearly 4 million people, diabetes-free subjects aged 40-70 years with serum CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) measurements available were followed for 2 years to assess the development of IFG and diabetes in five CHEMICALNOTIN subgroups: â¥25, 25.1-37.5, 37.6-50, 50.1-75, and >75 nmol/L. RESULTS The baseline cohort included 117,960 adults: 83,526 normoglycemic subjects and 34,434 subjects with IFG. During follow-up, 8,629 subjects (10.3% of the normoglycemic group) developed IFG, and 2,162 subjects (1.8% of the total cohort) progressed to diabetes. A multivariable model adjusted for age, sex, population group, immigrant status, BMI, season of CHEMICALNOTIN measurement, GENEIN and GENEIN CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, estimated glomerular filtration rate, history of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, Charlson comorbidity index, smoking, and socioeconomic status revealed an inverse association between CHEMICALIN and the risk of progression to IFG and diabetes. The odds of transitioning from normoglycemia to IFG, from normoglycemia to diabetes, and from IFG to diabetes in subjects with a CHEMICALNOTIN level â¤25 nmol/L were greater than those of subjects with a CHEMICALNOTIN level >75 nmol/L [odds ratio 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.24), 1.77 (1.11-2.83), and 1.43 (1.16-1.76), respectively]. CONCLUSIONS CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency appears to be an independent risk factor for the development of IFG and diabetes.
8636122	Structural features of the central CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN receptor involved in the binding of the specific GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN. The antagonist CHEMICALIN has a high specificity for the central GENEIN GENEIN and negligeable affinity for the peripheral GENEIN receptor, making it an excellent tool for probing receptor structure-activity relationships. From binding experiments with mutated GENENOTIN and with chimeric GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN receptors we have begun to identify the domains of GENENOTIN implicated in the recognition of CHEMICALNOTIN. Receptors were transiently expressed in COS-3 cells, and their binding characteristics were studied with CHEMICALNOTIN and with CHEMICALNOTIN, an agonist recognized equally well by the two receptors. The region delineated by the fourth and fifth transmembrane helices of GENEIN proved to be crucial for high affinity binding of CHEMICALIN. The GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN second extracellular loops, e2, were exchanged, modifications that had no effect on CHEMICALIN binding in the GENEIN variant but that eliminated CHEMICALIN binding in both mutants. The replacement of the conserved CHEMICALIN residues in e2 of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN also eliminated CHEMICALIN binding, but replacement of those in GENENOTIN resulted in the sequestration of the mutated receptors in the cell cytoplasm. The GENEIN thus plays some role in CHEMICALIN binding but none in CHEMICALIN recognition, binding of the latter clearly implicating residues in the adjoining transmembrane helices.
7885191	GENEIN: modified CHEMICALIN binding site associated with CHEMICALIN-->CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN mutants of GENEIN subunit. The non-competitive blocker site of the GENEIN in normal susceptible strains of Drosophila melanogaster and simulans binds CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) at specific sites with KdS of 1.6-1.9 nM and BmaxS of 171-181 fmol/mg protein. This specific binding of CHEMICALNOTIN is strongly inhibited by: a large number and variety of insecticidal channel blockers at 20 nM (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and a representative CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) or 200 nM (CHEMICALNOTIN); the insecticidal channel activators CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN at 20 nM; CHEMICALNOTIN at 30 microM and CHEMICALNOTIN at 300 microM. CHEMICALNOTIN resistance in D. melanogaster has been attributed to a mutation resulting in an GENENOTIN replacement in the GENEIN subunit and in D. simulans to an homologous CHEMICALIN-->CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN replacement. These mutations are shown here to greatly reduce CHEMICALNOTIN binding, i.e. lower affinity and apparent number of binding sites. The CHEMICALNOTIN-->CHEMICALNOTIN replacement with both melanogaster and simulans almost always reduces the potency in inhibiting CHEMICALNOTIN binding of each of eight channel blockers and of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN-->CHEMICALNOTIN replacement in D. simulans is generally less effective than the CHEMICALNOTIN-->CHEMICALNOTIN modification in reducing sensitivity to the channel blockers and to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The channel activators CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN usually retain their inhibitory potency in the GENEIN subunit mutants. Thus, it appears that replacement of CHEMICALNOTIN by CHEMICALNOTIN generally modifies the non-competitive blocker site and its coupling to the CHEMICALNOTIN-recognition site with less effect on the channel activator site. In contrast, the CHEMICALIN-->CHEMICALIN replacement has less impact in protecting the GENEIN from the action of insecticidal blockers. Each of the resistant strains has the same level of resistance to the lethal action of the five channel blockers examined but none to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN.
15120421	In vitro antiprogestational/antiglucocorticoid activity and CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN binding of the putative metabolites and synthetic derivatives of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN. In determining the biological profiles of various antiprogestins, it is important to assess the hormonal and antihormonal activity, selectivity, and potency of their proximal metabolites. The early metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN is characterized by rapid demethylation and hydroxylation. Similar initial metabolic pathways have been proposed for CHEMICALNOTIN (CDB: Contraceptive Development Branch of NICHD) and CHEMICALNOTIN, and their putative metabolites have been synthesized. We have examined the functional activities and potencies, in various cell-based assays, and relative binding affinities (RBAs) for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of the putative mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN and of the CHEMICALNOTIN and aromatic A-ring derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The binding affinities of the monodemethylated metabolites for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were similar to those of the parent compounds. Monodemethylated CHEMICALIN bound to GENEIN with higher affinity than monodemethylated CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. T47D-CO cells were used to assess inhibition of R5020-stimulated endogenous GENENOTIN activity and transactivation of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-luciferase (LUC) reporter plasmid in transient transfections. The antiprogestational potency was as follows: CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN/monodemethylated metabolites (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-9)M) > aromatic A-ring derivatives (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-8)M) > didemethylated/CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-7)M). Antiglucocorticoid activity was determined by inhibition of CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated transcriptional activity in HepG2 cells. The mono- and didemethylated metabolites of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN had less antiglucocorticoid activity (IC(50)'s approximately 10(-6)M) than monodemethylated CHEMICALNOTIN (IC(50) approximately 10(-8)M) or the other test compounds. At 10(-6)M in transcription assays, none of these compounds showed CHEMICALNOTIN agonist activity, whereas CHEMICALIN and its monodemethylated metabolite manifested slight GENEIN agonist activity. The reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of monodemethylated CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN was confirmed in vivo by the thymus involution assay in adrenalectomized male rats. The aromatic A-ring derivatives-stimulated transcription of an CHEMICALNOTIN-responsive reporter plasmid in MCF-7 and T47D-CO human breast cancer cells but were much less potent than CHEMICALNOTIN. Taken together, these data suggest that the proximal metabolites of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN contribute significantly to the antiprogestational activity of the parent compounds in vivo. Furthermore, the reduced antiglucocorticoid activity of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN compared to CHEMICALNOTIN in vivo may be due in part to decreased activity of their putative proximal metabolites.
10891536	Different mechanisms of acquired resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN in human colorectal cancer cells. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) are antimetabolites which are metabolized to their corresponding active forms which inhibit DNA synthesis via inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN). To investigate ways of overcoming CHEMICALNOTIN-resistance, we established acquired-resistant colorectal cancer cell lines against these three drugs by continuous and step-wise escalation of drugs, and analyzed the cytotoxicity and the mechanism of resistance to the drugs. When cells were incubated with the 3 drugs for 72 h, the resistance ratio to parental DLD-1 human colorectal tumor cells was 65.2 for DLD-1/5-FU, 9.7 for DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN and 448.6 for DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells. DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells did not show any cross-resistance against CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. However, DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells showed 3- and 9-fold increased resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively, and DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells also showed about 90-fold resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN. Analysis of enzyme activities and gene expression associated with CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism indicated that a significant decrease in GENENOTIN activity in DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells, a 7-fold increase of GENENOTIN mRNA in DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells, and a 37-fold decrease in GENENOTIN activity of DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells were the major mechanisms of drug resistance. These findings were closely associated with the cytotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN against the established CHEMICALNOTIN-, CHEMICALNOTIN- or CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant cells. When DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells expressing increased GENENOTIN mRNA were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN for only 4 h, the resistance ratios of DLD-1/CHEMICALNOTIN cells to parental DLD-1 cells were markedly different for CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, suggesting that the cytotoxicity with short-time exposure to CHEMICALIN is due to a mechanism other than GENEIN inhibition, although the cytotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN in the short-time is low compared to that of long-time exposure. In conclusion, CHEMICALIN, an antimetabolite that inhibits GENEIN activity, may be effective against CHEMICALNOTIN and/or CHEMICALNOTIN-resistance in colorectal cancer cells caused by amplification of GENENOTIN and/or deletion of GENENOTIN.
1332478	Failure of CHEMICALNOTIN to prevent preterm labor in the sheep. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to determine whether continuous infusion of CHEMICALNOTIN could prevent preterm delivery in sheep. STUDY DESIGN: Sheep in preterm labor induced by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) received infusions of either CHEMICALNOTIN (n = 5) or saline solution (n = 5), and the progress of labor was monitored. GENENOTIN density and function (agonist-induced CHEMICALNOTIN production) was measured in myometrial samples from both groups. RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN initially inhibited labor contractions. This inhibition was only maintained for 16 hours, after which both the amplitude and frequency of electromyographic bursts and contractions returned. The failure of the myometrium to respond to CHEMICALIN (desensitization) was associated with significant reductions in agonist-induced CHEMICALNOTIN production and GENEIN concentration in myometrial tissue collected from these animals compared with the saline solution-treated controls. CONCLUSIONS: Continuous infusion of CHEMICALNOTIN to sheep in preterm labor produces only a transient inhibition of contractions. This desensitization is caused by a down-regulation of myometrial GENENOTIN.
23292797	Smoothened is a fully competent activator of the heterotrimeric G protein G(i). Smoothened (Smo) is a 7-transmembrane protein essential to the activation of Gli transcription factors (Gli) by hedgehog morphogens. The structure of Smo implies interactions with heterotrimeric G proteins, but the degree to which G proteins participate in the actions of hedgehogs remains controversial. We posit that the G(i) family of G proteins provides to hedgehogs the ability to expand well beyond the bounds of Gli. In this regard, we evaluate here the efficacy of Smo as it relates to the activation of G(i), by comparing Smo with the 5-hydroxytryptamine(1A) (5-HT(1A)) receptor, a quintessential G(i)-coupled receptor. We find that with use of [(35)S]guanosine 5'-(3-O-thio)triphosphate, first, with forms of G(i) endogenous to human embryonic kidney (HEK)-293 cells made to express epitope-tagged receptors and, second, with individual forms of GÎ±(i) fused to the C terminus of each receptor, Smo is equivalent to the 5-HT(1A) receptor in the assay as it relates to capacity to activate G(i). This finding is true regardless of subtype of G(i) (e.g., G(i2), G(o), and G(z)) tested. We also find that Smo endogenous to HEK-293 cells, ostensibly through inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, decreases intracellular levels of cAMP. The results indicate that Smo is a receptor that can engage not only Gli but also other more immediate effectors.
23116965	Antiarrhythmic effects of CHEMICALIN, a novel GENEIN agonist in cultured neonatal rat ventricular myocytes. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a CHEMICALNOTIN extracted from green tea, has been proposed as an effective compound for improving cardiac contractility. However, the therapeutic potential of CHEMICALNOTIN on the treatment of arrhythmia remains unknown. We investigated the direct actions of CHEMICALNOTIN on the modulation of ion currents and cardiac cell excitability in the primary culture of neonatal rat ventricular myocyte (NRVM), which is considered a hypertrophic model for analysis of myocardial arrhythmias. By using the whole-cell patch-clamp configurations, we found CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced the slowly inactivating component of voltage-gated CHEMICALNOTIN currents (I(CHEMICALNOTIN)) in a concentration-dependent manner (0.1-100 Î¼M) with an EC(50) value of 3.8 Î¼M. CHEMICALNOTIN not only shifted the current-voltage relationship of peak I(CHEMICALNOTIN) to the hyperpolarizing direction but also accelerated I(CHEMICALNOTIN) recovery kinetics. Working at a concentration level of I(CHEMICALNOTIN) enhancement, CHEMICALNOTIN has no notable effect on voltage-gated CHEMICALNOTIN currents and L-type CHEMICALNOTIN currents. With culture time increment, the firing rate of spontaneous action potential (sAP) in NRVMs was gradually decreased until spontaneous early after-depolarization (EAD) was observed after about one week culture. CHEMICALNOTIN increased the firing rate of normal sAP about two-fold without waveform alteration. Interestingly, the bradycardia-dependent EAD could be significantly restored by CHEMICALNOTIN in fast firing rate to normal sAP waveform. The expression of dominant cardiac GENENOTIN subunit, GENENOTIN, was consistently detected throughout the culture periods. Our results reveal how CHEMICALNOTIN, the novel I(CHEMICALNOTIN) agonist, may act as a promising candidate in clinical applications on cardiac arrhythmias.
16920841	Liver GENEIN and kidney GENEIN expression are not affected by CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN intake in growing rats. GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) are 2 enzymes involved in CHEMICALIN oxidation. GENEIN is expressed at high levels in rat liver and its expression is regulated by dietary CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN is also found in rat kidney, albeit in substantially lower amounts, but it is not known whether kidney GENENOTIN expression is regulated by dietary CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Similarly, GENENOTIN activity is highest in the liver and kidney, but the regulation of its expression by diet has not been thoroughly investigated. Sprague Dawley rats ( approximately 50 g) were fed, for 9 d in 2 x 3 factorial design (n = 8), an CHEMICALNOTIN-defined diet varying in CHEMICALNOTIN (0.125, 0.3, or 0.8%) and CHEMICALNOTIN (0 or 25 mmol/kg diet). Liver and kidney GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were assessed using enzymatic, Western blot, and real-time PCR analyses. Liver samples were also fixed for histological analysis. Liver GENEIN activity was 1.3-fold higher in rats fed the CHEMICALNOTIN deficient diet containing CHEMICALIN, which was reflected in corresponding increases in mRNA content and immunodetectable protein. Independent of dietary CHEMICALIN, supplemental CHEMICALIN increased hepatic GENEIN activity approximately 30%. Kidney GENENOTIN and liver GENENOTIN expression were refractory to these diets. Some degree of fatty liver developed in all rats fed a CHEMICALNOTIN-devoid diet, indicating that supplemental CHEMICALNOTIN cannot completely compensate for the lack of dietary CHEMICALNOTIN in growing rats.
23548896	Identification of a new interaction mode between the GENENOTIN of GENEIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Proteins with GENENOTIN play major roles in GENENOTIN signaling. Structures of many GENENOTIN have been studied, and the regions involved in their interactions with ligands have been elucidated. However, these analyses have been performed using short peptides comprising CHEMICALNOTIN followed by a few CHEMICALNOTIN, which are described as the canonical recognition sites. Here we report the solution structure of the GENENOTIN of GENEIN (GENEIN) in complex with a longer phosphopeptide from GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). This structure, together with biochemical experiments, revealed the existence of a novel binding region in addition to the canonical CHEMICALIN-314 binding site of GENEIN. Mutational analysis of this second region in cells showed that both canonical and novel binding sites are required for tumor suppression through the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN interaction. Furthermore, the data indicate an allosteric connection between GENENOTIN binding and GENENOTIN activation that arises from residues in the Î²B/Î²C loop of the GENENOTIN.
23391442	Protective effects of protein transduction domain-metallothionein fusion proteins against hypoxia- and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis in an ischemia/reperfusion rat model. Ischemic heart diseases caused by insufficient oxygen supply to the cardiac muscle require pharmaceutical agents for the prevention of the progress and recurrence. Metallothionein (MT) has a potential as a protein therapeutic for the treatment of this disease due to its anti-oxidative effects under stressful conditions. In spite of its therapeutic potential, efficient delivery systems need to be developed to overcome limitations such as low transduction efficiency, instability and short half-life in the body. To enhance intra-cellular transduction efficiency, Tat sequence as a protein transduction domain (PTD) was fused with MT in a recombinant method. Anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative effects of Tat-MT fusion protein were evaluated under hyperglycemia and hypoxia stress conditions in cultured H9c2 cells. Recovery of cardiac functions by anti-apoptotic and anti-fibrotic effects of Tat-MT was confirmed in an ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) rat myocardial infarction model. Tat-MT fusion protein effectively protected H9c2 cells under stressful conditions by reducing intracellular ROS production and inhibiting caspase-3 activation. Tat-MT fusion protein inhibited apoptosis, reduced fibrosis area and enhanced cardiac functions in I/R. Tat-MT fusion protein could be a promising therapeutic for the treatment of ischemic heart diseases.
23418087	Lifelong exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN alters cardiac structure/function, protein expression, and DNA methylation in adult mice. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an estrogenizing endocrine disruptor compound of concern. Our objective was to test whether lifelong CHEMICALNOTIN would impact cardiac structure/function, CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis protein expression, and the DNA methylation of cardiac genes. We delivered 0.5 and 5.0 Âµg/kg/day CHEMICALNOTIN lifelong from gestation day 11 or 200 Âµg/kg/day from gestation day 11 to postnatal day 21 via the drinking water to C57bl/6n mice. CHEMICALNOTIN 5.0 males and females had increased body weight, body mass index, body surface area, and adiposity. Echocardiography identified concentric remodeling in all CHEMICALNOTIN-treated males. Systolic and diastolic cardiac functions were essentially similar, but lifelong CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced male and reduced female sex-specific differences in velocity of circumferential shortening and ascending aorta velocity time integral. Diastolic blood pressure was increased in all CHEMICALNOTIN females. The CHEMICALIN homeostasis proteins GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN, and GENEIN are important for contraction and relaxation. Changes in their expression suggest increased CHEMICALNOTIN mobility in males and reduced CHEMICALNOTIN mobility in females supporting the cardiac function changes. GENEIN expression was increased in all CHEMICALIN males and CHEMICALIN 0.5 females and reduced in CHEMICALIN 200 females. Global DNA methylation was increased in CHEMICALNOTIN 0.5 males and reduced in CHEMICALNOTIN 0.5 females. CHEMICALIN induced sex-specific altered DNA methylation in specific CHEMICALNOTIN pairs in the GENEIN CpG island. These results suggest that continual exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN impacts cardiac structure/function, protein expression, and epigenetic DNA methylation marks in males and females.
23000445	CHEMICALIN induces autophagy in MDA-MB-231 cells by regulating GENEIN-GENEIN pathway. Previous studies have demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN, a bioactive CHEMICALNOTIN extracted from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis Gerogi, has anti-inflammatory and anti-angiogenic activities. In this study, we evaluated CHEMICALNOTIN-induced autophagy on human breast MDA-MB-231 cells. We report that CHEMICALIN triggered the formation of GENEIN (GENEIN) positive autophagosomes and the accumulation of acidic vesicular and autolysosomes in MDA-MB-231 cells. In addition, cells treated by CHEMICALNOTIN developed autophagosome-like characteristics, including single and double membrane vacuoles containing intact and degraded cellular debris. The results showed that CHEMICALIN promotes the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited cell growth of MDA-MB-231 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, which was associated with CHEMICALNOTIN-induced autophagy. CHEMICALIN also suppressed the activation of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN by regulating the expression of the GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN involved GENEIN (GENEIN) signaling pathway. Taken together, these results suggest that CHEMICALIN partially inhibits MDA-MB-231 cell growth by inducing autophagy through the GENEIN-GENEIN pathway and may be a promising anti-tumor agent.
23125284	A mutation in the GENENOTIN gene, the human ortholog of GENENOTIN, impairs GENENOTIN assembly and is associated with ataxia and muscle hypotonia. The GENEIN (GENEIN) is a multi-subunit enzyme that transfers electrons from GENENOTIN to molecular CHEMICALIN, yielding water. Its biogenesis requires concerted expression of mitochondria- and nuclear-encoded subunits and assembly factors. In this report, we describe a homozygous missense mutation in GENENOTIN from a patient who displays ataxia and muscle hypotonia. The GENENOTIN gene is a remote, putative ortholog of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein co-expression analyses support the involvement of GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN function in mammals. The GENENOTIN mutation in the GENENOTIN gene, a mutation that is absent in sequenced exomes, leads to a reduced activity and lower levels of GENENOTIN and its protein subunits. The GENENOTIN protein is nearly absent in patient's fibroblasts. Cells affected by the mutation accumulate subassemblies of GENENOTIN that contain GENENOTIN but are almost devoid of GENENOTIN protein. We observe co-purification of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN proteins, supporting that the GENENOTIN defect hampers the early step of GENENOTIN assembly at the incorporation of the GENENOTIN subunit. Lentiviral complementation of patient's fibroblasts with wild-type GENENOTIN increases the GENENOTIN activity as well as the amount of GENENOTIN and of individual subunits. These results establish the function of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN assembly and support a causal role of the gene in GENENOTIN deficiency.
6687626	Deduced CHEMICALIN sequence from the GENEIN cDNA. The nonapeptide hormone CHEMICALNOTIN-like GENENOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is synthesized as part of a larger precursor polypeptide. The precursor also includes the GENENOTIN molecule with which the hormone is associated in the neurosecretory granules of the hypothalamo-pituitary tract. A protein of molecular weight (Mr) approximately 20,000 has been isolated from supraoptic nuclei of rat hypothalami which, after tryptic cleavage, released a GENENOTIN-like molecule of Mr approximately 10,000 and an oligopeptide related to CHEMICALNOTIN. This result was complemented by in vitro translation of bovine hypothalamic mRNA. Among the primary translation products a single polypeptide of Mr approximately 16,500 was shown to contain antigenic determinants recognized by specific antisera against GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Here we report the CHEMICALIN sequence of the GENEIN which was derived from sequence analysis of the cloned cDNA. As is the case for the GENENOTIN, the signal sequence of the GENENOTIN precursor is immediately followed by the nonapeptide hormone which is connected to GENENOTIN by a CHEMICALNOTIN sequence. A striking feature of the nucleic acid sequence is the 197-nucleotide long perfect homology with the GENENOTIN mRNA sequence encoding the conserved middle part of GENENOTIN.
23419638	CHEMICALIN activates the GENEIN and induces GENEIN in primary human hepatocytes and human cancer cell lines HepG2 and LS174T. We examined the effects of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) on the GENEIN (GENEIN)-GENEIN signaling pathway in human hepatocytes, hepatic HepG2 and intestinal LS174T cancer cells. GENEIN-dependent reporter gene expression in transfected HepG2 cells was increased by CHEMICALIN in a concentration-dependent manner at 24h. Similarly, CHEMICALIN induced the expression of GENEIN mRNA up to 5-fold in HepG2 and LS174T cells relative to the induction by 5 nM CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), the most potent activator of GENEIN. GENEIN and GENEIN mRNAs were also increased by CHEMICALIN in three primary human hepatocytes cultures (approximately 5% of CHEMICALIN potency) and the increase in GENEIN protein in HepG2 and LS174T cells was comparable to the increase in catalytic activity of GENEIN enzyme. Ligand binding analysis demonstrated that CHEMICALIN was a weak ligand of GENEIN. Enzyme kinetic analyses using human liver microsomes revealed inhibition of GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN (IC50 78 Î¼M) and CHEMICALIN (IC50 33 Î¼M). Overall, although most CHEMICALIN had no effects on GENEIN-GENEIN signaling, CHEMICALIN can bind to and activate the GENEIN and GENEIN-dependent gene expression, and CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibit the GENEIN catalytic activity.
7680751	Cloning and expression of a novel GENEIN with high affinity for CHEMICALIN psychotropic drugs. We have used the polymerase chain reaction technique to selectively amplify a GENENOTIN cDNA sequence from rat striatal mRNA that exhibits high homology to previously cloned GENENOTIN. Sequencing of a full length clone isolated from a rat striatal cDNA library revealed an open reading frame of 1311 base pairs, encoding a 437-residue protein with seven hydrophobic regions. Within these hydrophobic regions, this receptor was found to be 41-36% identical to the following GENENOTIN: GENENOTIN > GENENOTIN > GENENOTIN > GENENOTIN > GENENOTIN > GENENOTIN. Northern blots revealed a approximately 4.2-kilobase transcript localized in various brain regions, with the following rank order of abundance: striatum >> olfactory tubercle > cerebral cortex > hippocampus. Expression of this clone in COS-7 cells resulted in the appearance of high affinity, saturable binding of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) with a Kd of 1.26 nM. Among endogenous biogenic amines, only CHEMICALNOTIN completely inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN binding (Ki = 150 nM). The inhibition of CHEMICALIN binding by other serotonergic agonists and antagonists revealed a pharmacological profile that does not correlate with that of any previously described GENEIN subtype. In addition, this receptor exhibits high affinity for a number of CHEMICALNOTIN antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs, including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. In HEK-293 cells stably transfected with this receptor, CHEMICALIN elicits a potent stimulation of GENEIN activity, which is blocked by antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs. The distinct structural and pharmacological properties of this receptor site indicate that it represents a completely novel subtype of GENENOTIN. Based on its affinity for CHEMICALNOTIN psychotropic drugs and its localization to limbic and cortical regions of the brain, it is likely that this receptor may play a role in several neuropsychiatric disorders that involve serotonergic systems.
23489521	The use of GENENOTIN analogues in pregnancy. Excellent glycaemic control is essential in pregnancy to optimise maternal and foetal outcomes. The aim of this review is to assess the efficacy and safety of GENENOTIN analogues in pregnancy. GENENOTIN lispro and GENENOTIN aspart are safe in pregnancy and may improve post-prandial glycaemic control in women with type 1 diabetes. However, a lack of data indicating improved foetal outcomes would suggest that there is no imperative to switch to a short-acting analogue where the woman's diabetes is well controlled with GENENOTIN. There are no reports of the use of GENENOTIN glulisine in pregnancy and so its use cannot be recommended. Most studies of GENENOTIN glargine in pregnancy are small, retrospective and include women with pre-existing diabetes and gestational diabetes. There appear to be no major safety concerns and so it seems reasonable to continue GENENOTIN glargine if required to achieve excellent glycaemic control. A head-to-head comparison between GENENOTIN detemir and NPH GENENOTIN in women with type 1 diabetes showed that while foetal outcomes did not differ, fasting plasma CHEMICALIN improved with GENEIN detemir without an increased incidence of hypoglycaemia. The greater evidence base supports the use of GENENOTIN detemir as the first line long-acting analogue in pregnancy but the lack of definitive foetal benefits means that there is no strong need to switch a woman who is well controlled on NPH GENENOTIN. There seems little justification in using long acting GENENOTIN analogues in women with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes where the risk of hypoglycaemia is low.
17284757	CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN gene polymorphism, and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND: GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is the rate-limiting step in the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) biosynthetic pathway. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to test whether the common deletion [T/-] in the promoter of GENEIN affects the CHEMICALIN biosynthetic pathway and consequently modifies the effect of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on myocardial infarction (MI). DESIGN: Case subjects (n =1694) with a first nonfatal acute MI were matched by age, sex, and area of residence to 1694 population-based control subjects in Costa Rica. CHEMICALNOTIN were quantified by gas-liquid chromatography from plasma and adipose tissue samples. Least-squares means from generalized linear models and odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs from multiple conditional logistic regression models were estimated. RESULTS: The prevalence of the variant T/- allele was 48%. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN decreased in adipose tissue and plasma with increasing number of copies of the variant allele with a monotonic trend (P < 0.05 for all). Fasting plasma CHEMICALNOTIN by genotype were 2.08 mmol/L for TT, 2.16 mmol/L for T-, and 2.26 mmol/L for - - [ie, homozygous for the variant (deletion) allele] (P = 0.03). The GENENOTIN deletion was not associated with MI and did not significantly modify the association between adipose tissue CHEMICALNOTIN and the risk of MI. CONCLUSIONS: The GENENOTIN deletion may prevent the conversion of CHEMICALNOTIN into CHEMICALNOTIN. However, this metabolic effect is not translated into an attenuated risk between CHEMICALNOTIN and MI among carriers of the variant. It is possible that, at current intakes of CHEMICALNOTIN, any potential defect in the transcription of the gene is masked by the availability of substrate. Further research in populations deficient in CHEMICALNOTIN intake is warranted.
10398211	Altered vasoreactivity to CHEMICALNOTIN in experimental diabetic neuropathy: role of CHEMICALNOTIN. We evaluated the effects of GENEIN and an GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN) on nerve blood flow (NBF) and electrophysiology in control and diabetic rats. When applied locally to the sciatic nerve, the dose-response curve of CHEMICALNOTIN was more potent in experimental diabetic neuropathy (EDN) than control rats. No difference existed in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels between EDN and controls. The rats were given typical rat pellets or pellets treated with 10 mg/kg per day CHEMICALNOTIN for 4 weeks. Diabetes caused a significant reduction in NBF, nerve conduction velocity, and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitudes. NBF was significantly increased in diabetic rats supplemented with CHEMICALNOTIN diet, and nerve conduction velocity and amplitudes of the CMAP were also improved after 4 weeks on this diet. Direct application 10(-3) mol/L CHEMICALNOTIN on sciatic nerve did not increase NBF in normal and EDN rats. We topically applied the GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, on sciatic nerve and observed reduced inhibition of NBF in EDN, which was correctable with a CHEMICALIN diet. These results suggest that diabetic neuropathy may have an increasing vasopressor action with CHEMICALNOTIN and this is likely to be the mechanism of GENENOTIN inhibition. GENENOTIN inhibitors may have potential in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy.
7824160	Effect of the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN turnover in cultured cells expressing GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN receptors. The effect of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and its CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation was studied in cells expressing either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN receptors. The isomers of CHEMICALIN produced a concentration dependent increase in CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) hydrolysis at the GENEIN receptors, with the CHEMICALIN being more potent than the S(+) at the GENEIN receptor. The CHEMICALIN were significantly less efficacious at the GENEIN receptor as compared to CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALIN had no effect. At the GENEIN receptor, both CHEMICALIN were equipotent at stimulating CHEMICALNOTIN hydrolysis, with the CHEMICALIN being more efficacious at the GENEIN receptor compared with the R(-) isomer. In all cases at both the GENEIN and GENEIN receptors, the affinities of the isomers of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN were at least 2-3 orders of magnitude less than CHEMICALIN. Despite the weak effect of these compounds at the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN receptors, these substituted CHEMICALNOTIN do possess intrinsic activity which may contribute to their neurotoxic effects when administered at high doses.
23376140	Hepatocytes display a compensatory survival response against CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity by a mechanism mediated by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Although the liver is a CHEMICALNOTIN-target organ, hepatocyte response involved in its toxicity is not yet elucidated. A link between this heavy metal treatment and GENENOTIN signaling pathways was examined in primary mouse hepatocytes. We provided evidence of a novel link among GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN signaling, mediated by GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN. ROS produced by this GENENOTIN activates GENENOTIN, enable that in turn, transactivates GENENOTIN that activates GENEIN in CHEMICALIN, allowing its dimerization. Also, ROS from GENENOTIN favors GENENOTIN activation that phosphorylates GENEIN in CHEMICALIN, resulting in a compensatory or adaptive survival response such as production of GENEIN in short CHEMICALIN exposure times. However, after 12h CHEMICALIN treatment, cell viability diminished in 50%, accompanied by a drastic decrease of GENEIN production, and an increase in GENEIN activation and the pro-apoptotic protein GENEIN.
16864089	[Screening of short peptides binding to cell surface GENENOTIN]. OBJECTIVE: To screen and characterize the short peptides which bind specifically to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) for acquisition of small antagonists for blocking the binding of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN. METHODS: 12-mer phage displayed peptide library was screened with the target cells of MT-2 cells which expressed GENENOTIN at high levels. The binding phage clones were eluted by anti-GENENOTIN monoclonal antibody. After 3 rounds of screening, the positive phage clones were identified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunohistochemistry, and the CHEMICALNOTIN sequences of the positive clones were deduced from the DNA sequences. RESULTS: Seven positive clones were screened out of the 17 phage clones bound to MT-2 cells. The positive clone M15 could bind specifically to MT-2 cell and PHA-activated peripheral blood monouclear cells. CHEMICALNOTIN sequence analysis identified 6 sequences, all of which contained hydrophilic residues, and 5 of these 6 sequences included CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN conservative residues. CONCLUSION: The peptide sequences containing CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN conservative residues identified in this study can bind to cell surface GENEIN.
23411217	Peyer's patch-mediated intestinal immune system modulating activity of pectic-type polysaccharide from peel of Citrus unshiu. An intestinal immune system modulating polysaccharide (CUI-3IIb-3-2, 18kDa) was purified from Citrus unshiu peel. CUI-3IIb-3-2 mainly comprised GalA, GlcA, Ara, Gal and Rha, and it consisted of 4-linked GalA, terminal Araf, 4- or 5-linked/3,4- or 3,5-branched Ara, terminal Gal, and 2-linked/2,4-branched Rha. After CUI-3IIb-3-2 digestion by endo-Î±-d-(1â4)-polygalacturonase, its hydrolysate was fractionated into PG-1 and PG-2. Methylation analyses of PG-1 and PG-2 using base-catalysed Î²-elimination suggested that CUI-3IIb-3-2 be assumed as pectic-type polysaccharide. Since the activities of PG-1 and PG-2 were potently decreased, the whole polysaccharide structure of CUI-3IIb-3-2 would be essential to maintain the activity. Meanwhile, when CUI-3IIb was orally administered in mice, bone marrow cell proliferation and GM-CSF/IL-6 production from Peyer's patch cell were significantly higher (1.76- and 2.03/2.51-fold, respectively) than a saline. Therefore, a pectic-type polysaccharide from citrus peel could stimulate Peyer's patches and produce hematopoietic growth factors resulted in bone marrow cell proliferation.
23123771	An Indian butyrylcholinesterase variant L307P is not structurally stable: A molecular dynamics simulation study. The human butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activity is less than 1% in the serum of silent variant individuals of Vysya community in India. They are homozygous for a point mutation at codon 307 (CTTâCCT) resulting in the substitution of leucine 307 by proline. The reason for the disappearance of the protein in the serum has not been explicated till date. Based on this background, we performed molecular dynamics simulation to probe the structural stability of Indian variant (L307P) in comparison with wild and other BChE variants (D70G, E497V, V142M) having differential esterase activity. The simulation of all the mutants except D70G showed a much larger CÎ± root mean square deviation from the wild BChE crystal structure, showing the overall conformational disturbance. Further analysis revealed that secondary structure of the mutant proteins was not stable. The orientation of the catalytic triad is also distorted in all the mutants. The distance between Î´ nitrogen of His438 to Îµ oxygen of Glu325 and Îµ nitrogen of His438 to Î³ oxygen of Ser198 were highly altered in L307P mutant than the wild and other three variants throughout the simulation. Such disparity of distances between the catalytic residues may be due to the change in the protein conformation attributing to their differential catalytic activity. Our studies thus prove that the Indian BChE L307P mutant with negligible activity is possibly due to its structural instability when compared to other BChE variants.
14642426	The inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on the stress-induced plasma GENEIN level in mice. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on plasma GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in non-stressed and immobilization-stressed mice were investigated. Ginseng total CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN administered intraperitoneally attenuated the immobilization stress-induced increase in plasma GENEIN level. But, intracerebroventricular injection of each CHEMICALIN did not affect plasma GENEIN level induced by immobilization stress. CHEMICALIN significantly decreased CHEMICALIN and/or CHEMICALIN-induced increase of GENEIN level in macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7). Thus, it can be suggested that the inhibitory action of CHEMICALIN against the immobilization stress-induced increase of plasma GENEIN level would be in periphery; at least in part, mediated by blocking CHEMICALIN- and/or CHEMICALIN-induced increase of GENEIN level in macrophage rather than in the brain. CHEMICALNOTIN might be proposed as a possible candidate in the research or therapeutic modulation of stress-related disorders.
17352516	CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN, an oral GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, improves glycaemic control by inhibiting GENEIN inactivation of the GENEIN GENEIN and GENEIN. This increases active GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels, and decreases GENENOTIN levels and post-CHEMICALNOTIN-load CHEMICALNOTIN excursion. In large, well designed phase III trials in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, CHEMICALIN 100 or 200mg once daily alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemics was associated with significant improvements relative to placebo in overall glycaemic control and indices for GENEIN response and beta-cell function. Improvements from baseline in mean GENEIN (GENEIN) were significantly greater with CHEMICALIN monotherapy than with placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes. As add-on therapy in patients with suboptimal glycaemic control despite oral antihyperglycaemic treatment, CHEMICALIN improved GENEIN to a significantly greater extent than placebo when added to CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN and was noninferior to CHEMICALIN when added to CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN was well tolerated when administered alone or in combination with other antihyperglycaemics, with an adverse event profile similar to that shown with placebo. The incidence of hypoglycaemia with CHEMICALNOTIN was similar to that with placebo and, in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN, lower than that with CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN had a generally neutral effect on bodyweight.
23643883	GENENOTIN GENENOTIN induces apoptosis via GENENOTIN-independent pathway in human neuroblastoma cells: cytoplasmic relocalization of GENENOTIN. Streptococcus pneumoniae causes the most severe form of the bacterial meningitis which is the major cause of bacterial meningitis. Virulence factors produced by S. pneumoniae have been known to contribute significantly to the disease process. GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) which is essential for virulence and survival under stress conditions in S. pneumonia was examined for the ability to induce apoptosis and the mechanism of the induction of apoptosis in human neuron-like cells, SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cells. GENENOTIN inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in SK-N-SH cells. Treatment with GENENOTIN resulted in hypodiploid DNA contents, increased GENENOTIN/ GENENOTIN ratio and induction of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) production. The release of GENENOTIN from mitochondria into the cytosol, which is an initiator of the activation of GENENOTIN cascades, was not observed in GENENOTIN-treated cells. In addition, pretreatment with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a broad spectrum of GENEIN inhibitor, could not rescue apoptotic cells from GENENOTIN toxicity. Coincidently, GENENOTIN activation and cleavage of GENENOTIN were not detected. Moreover, GENENOTIN independent GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was released from mitochondria and translocated to the nucleus in response to GENENOTIN. We also found that GENENOTIN treatment resulted in the increase of GENENOTIN activity and cytoplasmic GENENOTIN levels were increased by GENENOTIN, suggesting that functional activation of GENENOTIN is intact despite increased cytoplasmic accumulation. Taken together, these data suggest that GENENOTIN contributes to neuronal damage in meningitis and provide further insight into the mechanisms underlying action of pneumococcal virulence factors during bacterial pathogenesis.
10095983	New aspects in the management of obesity: operation and the impact of GENENOTIN inhibitors. Obesity is an increasing health problem in most developed countries and its prevalence is also increasing in developing countries. There has been no great success with dietary means and life style modification for permanent weight loss. Various surgical treatment methods for obesity are now available. They are aimed at limiting oral energy intake with or without causing dumping or inducing selective maldigestion and malabsorption. Based on current literature, up to 75% of excess weight is lost by surgical treatment with concomitant disappearance of hyperlipidaemias, type 2 diabetes, hypertension or sleep apnoea. The main indication for operative treatment is morbid obesity (body mass index greater than 40 kg/m2) or severe obesity (body mass index > 35 kg/m2) with comorbidities of obesity. CHEMICALIN is a new inhibitor of GENEIN enzyme. At doses of 120 mg three times per day with meals it results in a 30% reduction in dietary fat absorption, which equals approximately 200 kcal daily energy deficit. In the long term, CHEMICALIN has been shown to be more effective than placebo in reducing body weight and serum total and GENEIN CHEMICALNOTIN levels. CHEMICALNOTIN has a lowering effect on serum CHEMICALNOTIN independent of weight loss. Along with weight loss, CHEMICALIN also favourably affects blood pressure and CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN levels in obese individuals and in obese type 2 diabetic patients.
23435915	The characteristics of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced inhibitory effects on intestinal motility. CHEMICALNOTIN belongs to CHEMICALNOTIN. Based on the facts that CHEMICALNOTIN exerts inhibitory effects on the contractility of vascular smooth muscle,the present study was designed to characterize the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on intestinal contractility and evaluate its potential clinical implication. Ex vivo [isolated jejunal segment (IJS) of rat], in vitro, and in vivo assays were used in the study. The results indicated that CHEMICALNOTIN (5-80 Î¼mol/L) inhibited the contraction of IJS in a dose-dependent manner and inhibited the increased-contractility of IJS induced by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, high CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. The inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were correlated with the stimulation of GENENOTIN since these inhibitory effects were significantly blocked in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN respectively. No further inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN were observed in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN or in CHEMICALNOTIN-free condition, indicating CHEMICALNOTIN-induced inhibitory effects are CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent. CHEMICALIN decreased GENEIN (GENEIN) protein contents and GENEIN mRNA expression in IJS, and inhibited both phosphorylation and CHEMICALNOTIN-GENEIN activity of purified myosin, implicating that the decrease of GENEIN contents and inhibition of GENEIN activity are involved in the CHEMICALIN-induced inhibitory effects. The study suggests the potential clinical implications of CHEMICALNOTIN in relieving intestinal hypercontractility.
23333261	Contribution of GENENOTIN to hyperglycaemia-induced neurotoxicity. Diabetes mellitus is associated to central nervous system damage, which results in impairment of brain functions and cognitive deficits and decline in memory. However, the mechanisms mediating the actions of CHEMICALNOTIN on the neurons remained elusive. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-GENENOTIN transcriptional repressor, is thought to be involved in some symptoms of Down syndrome. We hypothesized that GENENOTIN mediated hyperglycaemia-induced neuronal injury and impairment of learning and memory. It was found that expression of GENEIN protein in cortical neurons was increased in CHEMICALIN-induced diabetes mellitus rat model. GENENOTIN, down-regulated by GENENOTIN, was subsequently decreased as detected by confocal laser scanning microscopy and Western blot analysis. The expression pattern of GENEIN and GENEIN correspond to 50mmol/L CHEMICALIN (hyperglycaemia) was also found in primary cultured neurons. CHEMICALNOTIN, one neuroprotective agent, inhibited hyperglycaemia-induced neurotoxicity. Moreover, CHEMICALIN alleviated GENEIN expression, and reversely raised GENEIN expression in neurons treated with hyperglycaemia. Finally, we found that silencing GENENOTIN expression decreased hyperglycaemia-induced neuronal injury. In conclusion, GENENOTIN may mediate neurotoxicity during hyperglycaemia and thereby play a critical role in the development of hyperglycaemia-induced cognitive deficits.
23471540	Global analysis of Drosophila Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins reveals a multitude of novel recognition motifs and binding determinants. Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) are the largest group of transcription factors in higher metazoans. A complete characterization of these ZFPs and their associated target sequences is pivotal to fully annotate transcriptional regulatory networks in metazoan genomes. As a first step in this process, we have characterized the DNA-binding specificities of 129 zinc finger sets from Drosophila using a bacterial one-hybrid system. This data set contains the DNA-binding specificities for at least one encoded ZFP from 70 unique genes and 23 alternate splice isoforms representing the largest set of characterized ZFPs from any organism described to date. These recognition motifs can be used to predict genomic binding sites for these factors within the fruit fly genome. Subsets of fingers from these ZFPs were characterized to define their orientation and register on their recognition sequences, thereby allowing us to define the recognition diversity within this finger set. We find that the characterized fingers can specify 47 of the 64 possible DNA triplets. To confirm the utility of our finger recognition models, we employed subsets of Drosophila fingers in combination with an existing archive of artificial zinc finger modules to create ZFPs with novel DNA-binding specificity. These hybrids of natural and artificial fingers can be used to create functional zinc finger nucleases for editing vertebrate genomes.
20091113	Polymorphisms in GENEIN (GENEIN) are associated with stimulant effects of CHEMICALIN: an exploratory pharmacogenetic study using healthy volunteers. Individuals vary in their subjective responses to stimulant drugs, and these differences are believed to be partially genetic in origin. We evaluated associations between mood, cognitive and cardiovascular responses to CHEMICALNOTIN and four polymorphisms in the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN): rs460000, rs3756450, rs37022 and rs6869645. Healthy Caucasian male and female volunteers (N = 152) participated in a double-blind, crossover design study in which they received placebo, 10 and 20 mg of CHEMICALNOTIN. We measured self-reported rating of mood, performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, blood pressure and heart rate. Individuals with the C/C genotype at rs460000 (N = 83) reported approximately twofold higher ratings of stimulation and euphoria relative to the A/A+A/C (N = 69) genotype group, at both the 10 and 20 mg doses. No other responses or SNPs showed significant effects. rs460000 is in perfect LD with rs463379 (CEU: D' = 1; r (2) = 1), which was not studied here, but has been associated with etiology of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). These findings suggest a pleiotropic effect of this polymorphic locus on both ADHD and sensitivity to the subjective effects of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23163726	The structure and properties of septin 3: a possible missing link in septin filament formation. The human genome codes for 13 members of a family of filament-forming GTP-binding proteins known as septins. These have been divided into four different subgroups on the basis of sequence similarity. The differences between the subgroups are believed to control their correct assembly into heterofilaments which have specific roles in membrane remodelling events. Many different combinations of the 13 proteins are theoretically possible and it is therefore important to understand the structural basis of specific filament assembly. However, three-dimensional structures are currently available for only three of the four subgroups. In the present study we describe the crystal structure of a construct of human SEPT3 which belongs to the outstanding subgroup. This construct (SEPT3-GC), which includes the GTP-binding and C-terminal domains, purifies as a nucleotide-free monomer, allowing for its characterization in terms of GTP-binding and hydrolysis. In the crystal structure, SEPT3-GC forms foreshortened filaments which employ the same NC and G interfaces observed in the heterotrimeric complex of human septins 2, 6 and 7, reinforcing the notion of 'promiscuous' interactions described previously. In the present study we describe these two interfaces and relate the structure to its tendency to form monomers and its efficiency in the hydrolysis of GTP. The relevance of these results is emphasized by the fact that septins from the SEPT3 subgroup may be important determinants of polymerization by occupying the terminal position in octameric units which themselves form the building blocks of at least some heterofilaments.
23384446	The effect of inorganic CHEMICALNOTIN on endothelium-dependent relaxation: Role of GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Chronic CHEMICALNOTIN ingestion predisposes to vascular disease, but underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the present study we have analyzed the effects of short-term CHEMICALNOTIN exposure on vascular function and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Endothelium-dependent relaxations, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and endothelium derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF)-type, were studied in rabbit iliac artery and aortic rings using the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which promotes store-operated CHEMICALNOTIN entry by inhibiting the endothelial GENEIN pump. Production of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) in the endothelium of rabbit aortic valve leaflets and endothelium-denuded RIA and aortic rings was assessed by imaging of CHEMICALNOTIN. In the iliac artery, exposure to 100Î¼M CHEMICALNOTIN for 30min potentiated EDHF-type relaxations evoked by both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Potentiation was prevented by GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN mimetic CHEMICALNOTIN and the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. By contrast in aortic rings, that exhibited negligible EDHF-type responses, endothelium-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated relaxations evoked by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were unaffected by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN induced CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive increases in ROS production in the aortic valve endothelium, but not in the media and adventitia of the iliac artery and aorta. Our results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN can potentiate EDHF-type relaxations via a mechanism that is dependent on CHEMICALNOTIN, thus demonstrating that dismutation of the CHEMICALIN anion generated by GENEIN can potentially offset loss of CHEMICALNOTIN bioavailability under conditions of reduced GENENOTIN activity. By contrast, selective increases in endothelial ROS production following exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN failed to modify relaxations mediated by endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN.
17570561	CHEMICALNOTIN, antioxidant activity and stress-induced gene expression in high CHEMICALNOTIN-treated table grapes stored at low temperature. A pretreatment with 20kPa CHEMICALNOTIN+20 kPa O2+60 kPa CHEMICALNOTIN for 3 days proved effective in maintaining the fruit quality and controlling decay in table grapes (Vitis vinifera cv. Cardinal) stored at 0 degrees C. In the present work, we analyzed whether total CHEMICALNOTIN content, the molecular mechanism implicated in their biosynthesis and antioxidant activity is related to the beneficial effect of this gaseous treatment. We isolated partial cDNAs that codified for enzymes implicated in the CHEMICALIN biosynthesis such as GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN), and an antioxidant enzyme such as GENEIN (GENEIN). Low temperatures induced an accumulation of total CHEMICALNOTIN content in the skin of both treated and non-treated grapes, although levels were lower in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated fruit. By contrast, antioxidant activity decreased during storage at 0 degrees C in non-treated grapes but did not change in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated grapes. The up-regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis gene expression and GENENOTIN mRNA observed in non-treated grape is not enhanced in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated grapes, which presented low total decay. These results point out the ability of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated grapes to prevent the generation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species rather than their inactivation by means of induction of studied defense systems.
22580612	MUC1-C oncoprotein as a target in breast cancer: activation of signaling pathways and therapeutic approaches. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is a heterodimeric protein formed by two subunits that is aberrantly overexpressed in human breast cancer and other cancers. Historically, much of the early work on MUC1 focused on the shed mucin subunit. However, more recent studies have been directed at the transmembrane MUC1-C-terminal subunit (MUC1-C) that functions as an oncoprotein. MUC1-C interacts with EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor), ErbB2 and other receptor tyrosine kinases at the cell membrane and contributes to activation of the PI3Kî²AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)î²extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathways. MUC1-C also localizes to the nucleus where it activates the Wnt/Î²-catenin, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) and NF (nuclear factor)-ÎºB RelA pathways. These findings and the demonstration that MUC1-C is a druggable target have provided the experimental basis for designing agents that block MUC1-C function. Notably, inhibitors of the MUC1-C subunit have been developed that directly block its oncogenic function and induce death of breast cancer cells in vitro and in xenograft models. On the basis of these findings, a first-in-class MUC1-C inhibitor has entered phase I evaluation as a potential agent for the treatment of patients with breast cancers who express this oncoprotein.
23262035	Synthesis, crystal structure and antidiabetic activity of substituted (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino) phenylprop-2-en-1-one. A novel series of substituted (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino)phenylprop-2-en-1-onewere synthesized starting from 2-aminobenzothiazole and 1-aryl-3,3-bis- (methylsulfanyl)-2-propen-1-onesin the presence of a catalytic amount of sodium hydride in THF. The synthesised compounds' structures were confirmed by IR, Mass spectrometry, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR and HRMS spectral data. These compounds were evaluated for their antidiabetic activity, and most of the derivatives of (E)-3-(Benzo [d]thiazol-2-ylamino)phenylprop-2-en-1-one displayed significant antidiabetic activity.
17884974	CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a selective GENEIN inhibitor in man. For more than three decades, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) has been claimed to be devoid of significant inhibition of peripheral CHEMICALNOTIN. Meanwhile, attempts to explain its action by inhibition of a central GENENOTIN have been rejected. The fact that CHEMICALIN acts functionally as a selective GENEIN inhibitor led us to investigate the hypothesis of whether it works via preferential GENENOTIN blockade. Ex vivo GENEIN inhibition and pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALIN were assessed in 5 volunteers receiving single 1000 mg doses orally. Coagulation-induced CHEMICALIN and lipopolysaccharide-induced CHEMICALIN were measured ex vivo and in vitro in human whole blood as indices of GENEIN and GENEIN activity. In vitro, CHEMICALIN elicited a 4.4-fold selectivity toward GENEIN inhibition (IC(50)=113.7 micromol/L for GENEIN; IC(50)=25.8 micromol/L for GENEIN). Following oral administration of the drug, maximal ex vivo inhibitions were 56% (GENENOTIN) and 83% (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALIN plasma concentrations remained above the in vitro IC(50) for GENEIN for at least 5 h postadministration. Ex vivo IC(50) values (GENEIN: 105.2 micromol/L; GENEIN: 26.3 micromol/L) of CHEMICALIN compared favorably with its in vitro IC(50) values. In contrast to previous concepts, CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN by more than 80%, i.e., to a degree comparable to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and selective GENENOTIN inhibitors. However, a >95% GENENOTIN blockade relevant for suppression of platelet function was not achieved. Our data may explain acetaminophen's analgesic and antiinflammatory action as well as its superior overall gastrointestinal safety profile compared with NSAIDs. In view of its substantial GENEIN inhibition, recently defined cardiovascular warnings for use of GENENOTIN inhibitors should also be considered for CHEMICALIN.
17159811	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN in rat selected brain and peripheral tissues. OBJECTIVES: The alkaloid CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which exhibits a combined GENEIN and direct parasympathomimetic mechanism of action, is employed in conjunction with therapeutic interventions in the stimulation of central cholinergic transfer in cognitive diseases. We attempted to achieve pharmacologically-induced enhancement of the parasympathomimetic activity of CHEMICALNOTIN in the key areas of rat brain, using an interactive combination of the alkaloid with the transmembrane enhancer CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). METHODS: We investigated activities of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in brain areas (frontal cortex, basal ganglia, septum and hippocampus) and the hypophysis, and that of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in plasma and liver. RESULTS: Following administration of the highest of the CHEMICALIN doses used (2.5; 5; 10 mg/kg i.m.), GENEIN activity decreased mainly in the frontal cortex, hippocampus and hypophysis. In the interaction of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN inhibition was stronger but without any statistical significance. The peripheral inhibition of GENENOTIN was found to be dose-dependent. Premedication by CHEMICALNOTIN led to a slight change in the values of the activities monitored. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALNOTIN in terms of positive modulation of CHEMICALNOTIN targeting to the central nervous system had no statistically significant effect.
23022324	Inhibition of neurite outgrowth and alteration of cytoskeletal gene expression by CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN compounds that are often found in drinking water increase the risk of developmental brain disorders. In this study, we performed live imaging analyses of Neuro-2a cells expressing SCAT3, a GENENOTIN cleavage peptide sequence linking two fluorescent proteins; enhanced cyan fluorescence protein (ECFP) and Venus, to determine whether CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; 0, 1, 5, or 10 Î¼M) affects both neurite outgrowth and/or induces apoptosis with the same doses and in the same cell cultures. We observed that the area ratio of neurite to cell body in SCAT3-expressing cells was significantly reduced by 5 and 10 Î¼M CHEMICALIN, but not by 1 Î¼M, although the emission ratio of ECFP to Venus, an endpoint of GENEIN activity, was not changed. However, cytological assay using apoptotic and necrotic markers resulted in that apoptosis, but not necrosis, was significantly induced in Neuro-2a cells when CHEMICALNOTIN exposure continued after the significant effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on neurite outgrowth were found by live imaging. These results suggested that neurite outgrowth was suppressed by CHEMICALNOTIN prior to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis. Next, we examined the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on cytoskeletal gene expression in Neuro-2a cells. CHEMICALIN increased the mRNA levels of the GENEIN and decreased the mRNA levels of GENEIN and GENEIN in a dose-dependent manner; no significant effect was found in the mRNA levels of the GENEIN, GENEIN, or GENEIN. The changes in cytoskeletal gene expression are likely responsible for the inhibitory effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on neurite outgrowth.
2855368	A CHEMICALIN with selective and long-acting opioid antagonism at GENEIN in vitro. The interaction of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) with various GENEIN types was studied in vitro. Its potency as an antagonist of opioid effects was compared to that of CHEMICALNOTIN on the electrically evoked contractions of mouse vas deferens (Mvd) and guinea pig ileum myenteric plexus longitudinal muscle (Gpi) preparations. CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be 9-fold more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN in antagonizing the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in the Mvd and 22-fold less potent in antagonizing CHEMICALNOTIN in the Gpi. In the Mvd, the recovery half-time for CHEMICALNOTIN was longer than 1000 min. Neither compound showed agonism. The two compounds were also compared for their capacity to displace the binding of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN to rat brain membranes under conditions where delta, mu, and kappa sites were labeled. The relative affinities were 0.70, 0.16, and 0.14 for CHEMICALNOTIN and 0.05, 0.87, and 0.08 for CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. Thus, compared to CHEMICALNOTIN, which is mu selective, CHEMICALNOTIN is a delta-selective antagonist.
18068977	Inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN) by CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is an enzyme responsible for the inactivation of the glucoregulatory GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). In this report, we show that the hypolipidemic agent CHEMICALIN is a competitive inhibitor of GENEIN in vitro, with K(i)=57.8+/-2.3 microM. These results may have implications in the development of novel GENEIN inhibitors based on the use of CHEMICALIN as a lead compound for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.
23261590	CHEMICALIN suppresses GENEIN oligomer-induced microglia activation and thereby protects PC-12 cells from inflammation-mediated toxicity. A pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), aggregation and deposition of GENENOTIN, has been recognized as a potent activator of microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction. Therefore, downregulation of microglial activation has a significant therapeutic demand. In this study, focus was given to evaluate the ability of CHEMICALIN, an CHEMICALIN alkaloid isolated from marine-derived Microsporum sp., to attenuate microglial activation by oligomeric GENEIN (GENEIN). CHEMICALIN treatment significantly inhibited the generation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN species in GENEIN-activated BV-2 microglia cells. In addition, we found that CHEMICALIN significantly suppressed the production of neurotoxic inflammatory mediator GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in activated BV-2 cells. Moreover, the treatment downregulated the protein and gene expressions of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Further, activated microglia-mediated apoptosis of PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells was significantly repressed by CHEMICALNOTIN. The molecular mechanism studies suggested that CHEMICALIN may block the phosphorylation of GENEIN (GENEIN) molecule GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN) and nuclear translocation of GENEIN (GENEIN) GENEIN and GENEIN subunits. Regulation of these signalling pathways have most probably contributed to the anti-inflammatory activity of CHEMICALNOTIN. Collectively, these results suggest that with further studies CHEMICALNOTIN have a potential to be developed as a modulator of neuroinflammatory process in AD.
22370641	GENENOTIN is a novel target gene of GENENOTIN promoting chemoresistance to CHEMICALNOTIN in human gastric cancer cells. Resistance to chemotherapy is a major obstacle for curative treatment of human gastric cancer (GC). However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are secreted glycoproteins involved in embryogenesis and, on inappropriate expression in the adult, in cancer. Here, we show expression of GENENOTIN in GC patient specimens, human GC cell lines and in a mouse model of GC. In human GC cells, GENENOTIN expression was enhanced by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a scaffold protein of plasma membrane caveolae. GENENOTIN knock-down and overexpression experiments demonstrated that GENENOTIN increased the resistance to apoptotic cell death induced by the CHEMICALNOTIN chemotherapeutics CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALIN increased the activity of the GENEIN through GENEIN-dependent binding of GENEIN to the proximal GENEIN. CHEMICALIN increased both GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN expression in human GC cells and within the tumor area of a murine model of GC (CEA424-SV40 TAg). In GC patients, GENENOTIN expression was positively associated with the tumor stage and the nodal status, and inversely correlated with the response to ECF (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) chemotherapy. These results showed that GENEIN and GENEIN are upregulated by chemotherapeutics and enhance the resistance of GC cells to CHEMICALIN drugs. Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN-induced drug resistance will provide benefits in developing new therapies for GC.
23583884	CHEMICALNOTIN-induced inflammatory activation is mediated by intracellular free CHEMICALNOTIN in microglial cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) has been known to induce inflammatory signaling in a number of cell types and tissues. However, the adverse effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the central nervous system (CNS) have not been entirely elucidated. In this study, using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and ELISA, we showed that CHEMICALIN up-regulated the expression and secretion of GENEIN (GENEIN) in a time-dependent manner in cultured HAPI microglial cells. CHEMICALIN also caused a fast (within 30min as judged by the increase in its mRNA level) activation of GENEIN (GENEIN). This initial action was accompanied by up-regulation of GENEIN (GENEIN), an important inflammation marker within 1h after CHEMICALIN treatment. These pro-inflammatory responses were inhibited by two types of CHEMICALNOTIN blockers, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN, thus, indicating that the effects are triggered by initial increase in the intracellular concentration of free CHEMICALNOTIN ([CHEMICALNOTIN]i). Further, CHEMICALIN exposure could induce phosphorylation- and ubiquitination-dependent degradation of GENEIN, and the translocation of GENENOTIN from the cytosol to the nucleus in this microglial cell line. Thus, the GENEIN signaling pathway can be activated after CHEMICALIN treatment. However, CHEMICALNOTIN blockers also obviously attenuated GENEIN activation and transnuclear transport induced by CHEMICALIN. In concert with these results, we highlighted that the secretion of pro-inflammatory GENEIN and GENEIN activation induced by CHEMICALIN can be mediated by elevation of [CHEMICALIN]i in HAPI microglial cells.
18093407	Introduction: The pharmacological profile of CHEMICALNOTIN--implications for cerebrovascular and cardiovascular risk reduction. Moderate elevations in blood pressure translate to significant increases in cardiovascular and cerebro vascular risk. Beneficially, this relationship allows small decreases in blood pressure to be associated with risk reduction. Both the GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN system and the sympathetic nervous system are involved in hypertension, hence targeting these systems is likely to be of benefit in the treatment of hypertension. GENENOTIN blockers (ARBs) are used for controlling blood pressure and treating heart failure in a broad range of patients, including those with diabetes and the elderly. Not only have ARBs shown good efficacy and tolerability, they also appear to have a protective effect that goes beyond that expected from the reduction of blood pressure. The ARB CHEMICALIN is a nonbiphenyl nontetrazole GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonist, which acts to decrease total peripheral resistance. CHEMICALIN acts at vascular GENEIN (postsynaptically) and at presynaptic GENEIN, where it inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN release. In clinical studies, CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to significantly reduce cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, whilst avoiding the persistent cough that commonly occurs with the use of GENENOTIN inhibitors. CHEMICALNOTIN can also be differentiated from other ARBs due to its noradrenergic effects, which other ARBs used at therapeutic doses do not possess. CHEMICALNOTIN, therefore, represents a useful therapeutic option in the management of patients with hypertension, including those with a history of stroke or with co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus.
10401556	Analysis of GENENOTIN pharmacology in rat small mesenteric artery. 1. To illuminate the controversy on GENEIN- or GENEIN involvement in CHEMICALIN-mediated contractions of rat small mesenteric artery (SMA), we have studied the effects of subtype-selective GENENOTIN agonists and antagonists under different experimental conditions. 2. The agonist potency order in rat SMA was: CHEMICALNOTIN >> CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN antagonized all agonists with a low potency (pA2: 8.29-8.80) indicating the involvement of GENEIN-rather than GENEIN. 3. The putative GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, but not the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (10 microM) antagonized CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contractions of SMA. The potency of the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN against CHEMICALNOTIN (pA2 = 6.16 +/- 0.13) and of the selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN against CHEMICALNOTIN (pKB = 8.35 +/- 0.10) and against the selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN (pKB = 8.40 +/- 0.09) were too low to account for GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN involvement. 4. The potency of CHEMICALNOTIN (pKB/pA2's = 7.72-8.46) was not affected by lowering temperature, changing experimental protocol or inducing myogenic tone via CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. 5. Selective protection of a putative GENEIN population against the irreversible action of CHEMICALIN also failed to increase the potency of CHEMICALNOTIN (pA2 = 8.25 +/- 0.06 against A61603). 6. Combined concentration-ratio analysis demonstrated that CHEMICALIN, which does not discriminate between GENEIN- and GENEIN, and CHEMICALIN competed for binding at the same site in the SMA. 7. In summary, data obtained in our experiments in rat SMA indicate that the GENEIN mediating CHEMICALIN-induced contraction displays a distinct GENEIN pharmacology. This study does not provide evidence for the hypothesis that GENENOTIN represent an affinity state of the GENENOTIN in functional assays. Furthermore, there is no co-existing GENENOTIN in the SMA.
7768269	Discriminative stimulus effects of esteratic local anesthetics in squirrel monkeys. A number of esteratic local anesthetics serve as positive reinforcers and produce CHEMICALNOTIN-like discriminative stimulus effects in animals. It has been suggested that the affinity of these compounds for a site on the GENENOTIN, and not their local anesthetic actions, is responsible for these abuse-related behavioral effects. In the present study, three local anesthetics previously shown to be self-administered in animals were examined in squirrel monkeys trained to discriminate CHEMICALNOTIN (0.3 mg/kg) from saline in a two-lever, food-reinforced procedure. CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1-3.0 mg/kg) fully and dose-dependently substituted for CHEMICALNOTIN. Doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (1.7 mg/kg) and CHEMICALNOTIN (0.3 mg/kg) which produced full (> 80%) substitution for CHEMICALNOTIN were administered in combination with the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN (both at 0.003-0.03 mg/kg). CHEMICALNOTIN fully blocked the CHEMICALNOTIN-like discriminative stimulus effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, but CHEMICALNOTIN produced only partial antagonism of CHEMICALNOTIN-lever selection. In addition, there was some evidence that CHEMICALNOTIN blocked CHEMICALNOTIN-lever responding produced by a lower dose of CHEMICALNOTIN. In substitution studies, neither CHEMICALNOTIN (1-10 mg/kg) nor CHEMICALNOTIN (1-30 mg/kg) produced CHEMICALNOTIN-like effects. These results support a role for CHEMICALNOTIN in the behavioral effects of some local anesthetics.
11401111	Plasma GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN: prognostic utility and prediction of benefit from CHEMICALNOTIN in chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction. Australia-New Zealand Heart Failure Group. OBJECTIVES: We sought to assess plasma concentrations of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN for prediction of adverse outcomes and responses to treatment in 297 patients with ischemic left ventricular (LV) dysfunction who were randomly assigned to receive CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo. BACKGROUND: Although neurohormonal status has known prognostic significance in heart failure, the predictive power of either GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN in chronic ischemic LV dysfunction has not been previously reported. METHODS: Plasma GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were measured in 297 patients with chronic ischemic (LV) dysfunction before randomization to CHEMICALNOTIN or placebo, added to established treatment with a converting enzyme inhibitor and loop diuretic (with or without digoxin). The patients' clinical outcomes, induding mortality and heart failure events, were recorded for 18 months. RESULTS: Above-median GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels conferred increased risks (all p < 0.001) of mortality (risk ratios [95% confidence intervals]: 4.67 [2-10.9] and 3.92 [1.76-8.7], respectively) and hospital admission with heart failure (4.7 [2.2-10.3] and 2.4 [1.3-4.5], respectively). Both of these predicted death or heart failure independent of age, New York Heart Association functional class, LV ejection fraction, previous myocardial infarction or previous admission with heart failure. CHEMICALIN reduced the risk of death or heart failure in patients with above-median levels of GENEIN or GENEIN, or both, to rates not significantly different from those observed in patients with levels below the median value. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with established ischemic LV dysfunction, plasma GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are independent predictors of mortality and heart failure. CHEMICALIN reduced mortality and heart failure in patients with higher pre-treatment plasma GENEIN and GENEIN.
23146690	Synergistic anti-cancer effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and chemotherapeutic agent CHEMICALNOTIN against human malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells. Dietary phytochemicals as adjuvants have been suggested to play important roles in enhancing chemotherapeutic potential owing to multitargeted chemopreventive properties and lack of substantial toxicity. Here, we investigated the efficacy of the combined treatment of various phytochemicals with the anticancer drug CHEMICALNOTIN in malignant mesothelioma MSTO-211H cells and normal mesothelial MeT-5A cells. The combined treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN produced a synergistic antiproliferative effect in MSTO-211H cells, but not in MeT-5A cells. In MSTO-211H cells, the nuclear accumulation of GENENOTIN and the levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN were effectively decreased by the combined treatment of them. In combination with CHEMICALIN, the ability of CHEMICALIN to reduce the contents of GENEIN and its target gene products was also evident in a time- and dose-dependent experiment. The inhibition of GENEIN using CHEMICALIN augmented a decrease in the GENEIN level induced by their combination, but it showed no significant effects on expression of GENEIN and GENEIN. Taken together, the data provide evidence that the synergistic antiproliferative effect of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN is linked to the inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN activities, and suggest that this combination may have therapeutic value in treatment of malignant mesothelioma.
23122079	CHEMICALIN attenuates high CHEMICALNOTIN-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes through the activation of GENEIN/GENEIN-dependent signalling. CHEMICALNOTIN, an active constituent found in many medicinal plants and certain functional foods, has anti-obesity activity in vivo. The aim of our study was to provide new data on the molecular mechanism(s) underlying the role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the prevention of high CHEMICALNOTIN-induced lipid accumulation in human HepG2 hepatocytes. We found that CHEMICALNOTIN suppressed high CHEMICALNOTIN-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. CHEMICALIN strongly inhibited high CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN (GENEIN) expression by modulating GENEIN (GENEIN) activation. Moreover, use of the pharmacological GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN revealed that GENEIN is essential for suppressing GENENOTIN expression in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated cells. Finally, we found that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) phosphorylation is required for the CHEMICALIN-enhanced activation of GENEIN in HepG2 hepatocytes. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN prevents lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells by blocking the expression of GENEIN and GENEIN through GENEIN/GENEIN activation, suggesting that CHEMICALIN is a novel GENEIN activator with a role in the prevention and treatment of obesity.
15898717	Structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of the binding of the 40 kDa CHEMICALNOTIN-GENENOTIN and its individual positional isomers to the extracellular domain of the receptor GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN exert antiviral and antiproliferative activities through the binding to a common cell surface receptor comprising two subunits, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a potent drug (Roferon-A) used to treat various cancers and viral diseases including Hepatitis B/C infections. To significantly improve the pharmacological properties of the drug, a pegylated form of GENENOTIN was developed (PEGASYS). This 40 kDa CHEMICALIN-conjugated GENEIN ((40)PEG-GENENOTIN) is obtained by the covalent binding of one 40 kDa branched PEG-polymer to a CHEMICALIN side-chain of GENEIN. Here, we report the detailed structural, kinetic, and thermodynamic analysis of the binding to the extracellular domain of the receptor GENENOTIN of (40)PEG-GENENOTIN and its isolated positional isomers modified at K31, K134, K131, K121, K164, and K70, respectively, in comparison with unmodified GENENOTIN. Our binding studies, using the surface plasmon resonance technique, show that the pegylation does not abolish the binding to the receptor, but significantly reduces the affinity mainly due to a change of the association rate. The results are supported by modeling and simulation of the binding, using Self-Avoiding-Walk calculations for the polymer conformations. A correlation between the structural parameters and the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the binding of the positional isomers could be established. For the Isomer-K31 and -K164, the PEG-polymer attachment point is located in proximity to the binding interface, and the isomers display affinity in the range 150-520 nM in an enthalpy-driven binding process. In contrast for the Isomer-K134, -K131, -K121, and -K70, the CHEMICALNOTIN-polymer is attached remotely from the binding interface, and the isomers exhibit a higher affinity (32-76 nM) in an entropy-driven binding process. This study constitutes an essential collection of knowledge on which the interaction of (40)PEG-GENENOTIN and its positional isomers with its cellular receptors can be better understood.
22935616	Noncanonical control of C. elegans germline apoptosis by the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling pathways. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway controls a number of physiological processes in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, including development, aging and stress response. We previously found that the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ortholog GENENOTIN dampens the apoptotic response to genotoxic stress in the germline by negatively regulating the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Here, we report unexpected rearrangements to the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway, whereby the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN oppose GENENOTIN to promote DNA damage-induced apoptosis. While DNA damage does not affect phosphorylation at the GENENOTIN site GENENOTIN of GENEIN, it increased phosphorylation at CHEMICALIN517/CHEMICALIN473. Although ablation of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN completely suppressed GENENOTIN-dependent apoptosis, the transcriptional activation of GENENOTIN was unaffected, suggesting that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN act independently or downstream of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Ablation of the GENENOTIN paralog GENENOTIN or the downstream target of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway GENENOTIN (a GENENOTIN transcription factor) restored sensitivity to damage-induced apoptosis in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mutants. In addition, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mutants have reduced levels of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN in their germ cells, indicating that the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway promotes GENENOTIN signaling in the germline. Ablation of the GENENOTIN effector GENENOTIN, a negative regulator of GENENOTIN, restored sensitivity to apoptosis in GENENOTIN mutants, suggesting that GENENOTIN acts downstream of GENENOTIN. In addition, the hypersensitivity of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN gain-of-function mutants to damage-induced apoptosis was suppressed to wild-type levels by ablation of GENENOTIN. Thus, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling selectively engages GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN to promote DNA damage-induced germ cell apoptosis downstream of GENENOTIN through the GENENOTIN pathway.
23642478	GENENOTIN inhibitors. CHEMICALIN incorporating CHEMICALIN moieties strongly inhibit GENEIN. A series of CHEMICALIN incorporating CHEMICALIN moieties (CHEMICALIN analogs) were assayed as inhibitors of the GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN) from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, GENEIN. Some of these compounds were low nanomolar or subnanomolar GENENOTIN inhibitors and showed selectivity ratios in the range of 4.91-69.86 for inhibiting the yeast enzyme over the offtarget human (h) isoforms GENENOTIN and of 6.46-13.52 for inhibiting GENENOTIN over GENENOTIN. The model organism S. cerevisiae and this particular enzyme may be useful for detecting antifungals with a novel mechanism of action compared to the classical CHEMICALNOTIN drugs to which significant drug resistance emerged. Indeed, some of these CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the growth of the yeast with CC50-s in the range of 0.73-6.54Î¼M.
23063590	CHEMICALIN inhibits melanogenesis through downregulation of GENEIN-dependent expression of GENEIN gene. CHEMICALNOTIN is associated with the regulation of melanogenesis which is the major physiological defense against solar irradiation. The present study was designed to determine the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on melanogenesis and its mechanisms of action in human epidermal melanocytes. In this study, we found that CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited melanin content. The mRNA levels of GENEIN (GENEIN) and its downstream genes GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN were reduced by CHEMICALIN treatment. Additionally, the mRNA levels of melanogenesis-related genes (GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), and GENEIN (GENEIN)) were down-regulated by CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN production and GENEIN (GENEIN) activity were suppressed by CHEMICALIN. Moreover, attempts to elucidate a possible mechanism underlying the CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated effects revealed that CHEMICALIN regulated melanogenesis by inhibiting CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis through downregulation of the GENEIN gene, which was mediated through reduced expression of the GENEIN gene. Taken together, these findings indicate that the inhibition of melanogenesis by CHEMICALIN occurs through reduced expression of the GENEIN gene, which is mediated by GENEIN inhibition and suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN may be useful as a hyperpigmentation inhibitor.
7711211	CHEMICALIN metabolites modulate the GENEIN and GENEIN gene expression in prepubertal rabbits. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a synthetic CHEMICALNOTIN, used as a contraceptive agent, that is biotransformed at target tissues into CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, which possess different pharmacological properties. The effects of these metabolites on the expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) genes, both regulated by CHEMICALIN, were evaluated in the uterus of prepubertal female rabbits that were simultaneously treated with P4 (1.0 mg) for 5 consecutive days. As determined by Western and Northern blot analyses, CHEMICALIN inhibited the P4-induced GENEIN gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. A similar inhibition was observed with the administration of CHEMICALNOTIN. The estrogenic agent CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN at a dose of 1.0 mg also inhibited the GENEIN gene expression induced by P4. Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN blocked the GENEIN down-regulation induced by P4 as assessed by Western and Northern blot methods. The inhibition of GENEIN synthesis and GENEIN down-regulation by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN indicates that these CHEMICALIN metabolites possess antiprogestational properties.
23552851	CHEMICALIN-induced autophagy mitigates cell apoptosis through modulation of GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN and GENEIN signaling pathways in human lung cancer cell lines. Our previous study has revealed that CHEMICALNOTIN, a compound with anti-inflammatory, lipid-lowering, anticancer and hepatoprotective effects, may induce autophagy in hepatoma cells. Autophagy is a lysosomal degradation pathway that is essential for cell survival and tissue homeostasis. In this study, the role of autophagy and related signaling pathways during CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis in human lung cancer cells was investigated. Results from CHEMICALNOTIN and annexin-V/PI double-staining assay showed that GENENOTIN- and GENENOTIN-dependent, and dose-dependent apoptoses were detected after a 24-h CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. Meanwhile, autophagy was detected as early as 12Â h after an exposure to low-dose CHEMICALIN, as indicated by an up-regulated expression of GENEIN and GENEIN proteins. Blockade of autophagy with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN sensitized the A549 and H1299 cells to apoptosis. Treatment of A549 and H1299 cells with CHEMICALIN caused a dose-dependent increase in GENEIN and GENEIN activity, accompanied with a decreased GENEIN expression and decreased phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN. Taken together, this study demonstrated for the first time that autophagy occurred earlier than apoptosis during CHEMICALNOTIN-induced human lung cancer cell line apoptosis. CHEMICALIN-induced autophagy via GENEIN and GENEIN pathways may provide a protective mechanism for cell survival against CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis to act as a cytoprotective reaction.
23550028	CHEMICALIN from Hedyotis diffusa Willd induces apoptosis in human leukemic U937 cells through modulation of GENEIN pathways. The herb of Hedyotis diffusa Willd (H. diffusa Willd), an annual herb distributed in northeastern Asia, has been known as a traditional oriental medicine for the treatment of cancer. Recently, Chinese researchers have discovered that two CHEMICALNOTIN isolated from a water extract of H. diffusa Willd showed apoptosis-inducing effects against cancer cells. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly understood. The current study determines the role of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in human leukemic U937 cells apoptosis induced by CHEMICALNOTIN from H. diffusa. Our results showed that CHEMICALIN decreased phosphorylation-GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and increased GENEIN, but did not affect expressions of GENEIN in U937 cells. Moreover, treatment of U937 cells with CHEMICALIN resulted in activation of GENEIN. Furthermore, CHEMICALNOTIN (GENENOTIN inhibitor) significantly enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis in U937 cells, whereas GENENOTIN inhibitor or CHEMICALIN (GENEIN inhibitor), decreased apoptosis in U937 cells. Taken together, our study for the first time suggests that CHEMICALIN is able to enhance apoptosis of U937 cells, at least in part, through activation of GENEIN and downregulation of GENENOTIN. Moreover, the triggering of GENENOTIN activation mediated apoptotic induction.
20541672	Hormonal therapy of prostate cancer. Of all cancers, prostate cancer is the most sensitive to hormones: it is thus very important to take advantage of this unique property and to always use optimal androgen blockade when hormone therapy is the appropriate treatment. A fundamental observation is that the serum testosterone concentration only reflects the amount of testosterone of testicular origin which is released in the blood from which it reaches all tissues. Recent data show, however, that an approximately equal amount of testosterone is made from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) directly in the peripheral tissues, including the prostate, and does not appear in the blood. Consequently, after castration, the 95-97% fall in serum testosterone does not reflect the 40-50% testosterone (testo) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) made locally in the prostate from DHEA of adrenal origin. In fact, while elimination of testicular androgens by castration alone has never been shown to prolong life in metastatic prostate cancer, combination of castration (surgical or medical with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist) with a pure anti-androgen has been the first treatment shown to prolong life. Most importantly, when applied at the localized stage, the same combined androgen blockade (CAB) can provide long-term control or cure of the disease in more than 90% of cases. Obviously, since prostate cancer usually grows and metastasizes without signs or symptoms, screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is absolutely needed to diagnose prostate cancer at an 'early' stage before metastasis occurs and the cancer becomes non-curable. While the role of androgens was believed to have become non-significant in cancer progressing under any form of androgen blockade, recent data have shown increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) in treatment-resistant disease with a benefit of further androgen blockade. Since the available anti-androgens have low affinity for AR and cannot block androgen action completely, especially in the presence of increased AR levels, it becomes important to discover more potent and purely antagonistic blockers of AR. The data obtained with compounds under development are promising. While waiting for this (these) new anti-androgen(s), combined treatment with castration and a pure anti-androgen (bicalutamide, flutamide or nilutamide) is the only available and the best scientifically based means of treating prostate cancer by hormone therapy at any stage of the disease with the optimal chance of success and even cure in localized disease.
16281286	Spectrum of mutations in mut methylmalonic acidemia and identification of a common Hispanic mutation and haplotype. Cobalamin nonresponsive methylmalonic acidemia (MMA, mut complementation class) results from mutations in the nuclear gene MUT, which codes for the mitochondrial enzyme methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MCM). To better elucidate the spectrum of mutations that cause MMA, the MUT gene was sequenced in 160 patients with mut MMA. Sequence analysis identified mutations in 96% of disease alleles. Mutations were found in all coding exons, but predominantly in exons 2, 3, 6, and 11. A total of 116 different mutations, 68 of which were novel, were identified. Of the 116 different mutations, 53% were missense mutations, 22% were deletions, duplications or insertions, 16% were nonsense mutations, and 9% were splice-site mutations. Sixty-one of the mutations have only been identified in one family. A novel mutation in exon 2, c.322C>T (p.R108C), was identified in 16 of 27 Hispanic patients. SNP genotyping data demonstrated that Hispanic patients with this mutation share a common haplotype. Three other mutations were seen exclusively in Hispanic patients: c.280G>A (p.G94R), c.1022dupA, and c.970G>A (p.A324T). Seven mutations were seen almost exclusively in black patients, including the previously reported c.2150G>T (p.G717V) mutation, which was identified in 12 of 29 black patients. Two mutations were seen only in Asian patients. Some frequently identified mutations were not population-specific and were identified in patients of various ethnic backgrounds. Some of these mutations were found in mutation clusters in exons 2, 3, 6, and 11, suggesting a recurrent mutation.
10444166	Common resistance mechanisms to deoxynucleoside analogues in variants of the human erythroleukaemic line K562. Resistant variants of the human leukaemic line K562 were developed using selection with the deoxynucleoside analogues CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The resistant lines displayed a high degree of cross resistance to all deoxynucleoside analogues, with little or no cross resistance to other agents. There was a profound accumulation defect of all nucleoside analogues in the resistant variants but no significant defect in nucleoside transport in any of the variants. GENENOTIN activity was strongly increased and GENENOTIN activity was moderately reduced in all of the resistant variants, resulting in reduced accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN analogues. In addition a deletion in one of the alleles of the GENEIN was detected in the CHEMICALIN-resistant line. GENEIN activity was found to be strongly increased in the CHEMICALIN-selected line and GENEIN was increased in the CHEMICALIN-selected line. Free CHEMICALNOTIN pools were increased in the CHEMICALNOTIN-selected line. There was no expression of the GENENOTIN gene by the resistant lines. Karyotypic analysis and FISH experiments using a 6q21 specific probe showed alterations in the 6(q16-q22) region which contains the GENENOTIN gene. Early events in the activation and degradation of deoxynucleoside analogues appear to constitute common mechanisms of resistance to these compounds.
23466232	A new series of CHEMICALIN analogues as GENEIN inhibitors. Several members of a new family of non-CHEMICALNOTIN-type GENEIN inhibitors, bearing a CHEMICALIN moiety and various substituent at the N2 position, were synthesized and their activities were investigated. The newly synthesized compounds displayed different inhibition profile towards GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Almost all the compounds had strong inhibitory activities against GENENOTIN. Regarding GENENOTIN, only analogs with N2-aromatic substituents displayed varying degrees of inhibitory activities on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and nearly all compounds showed no inhibition against GENENOTIN. Structure-activity relationship studies indicated that CHEMICALIN moiety is a favorable scaffold to exert the GENEIN inhibitory activity and substituents at the N2 position have considerable influence on the efficacy of the inhibition activities.
22865292	The GENENOTIN mutation in the GENENOTIN subunit increases lysosomal pH, impairs GENENOTIN translocation, and decreases in vitro osteoclastogenesis. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a multisubunit enzyme located at the ruffled border and in lysosomes of osteoclasts, is necessary for bone resorption. We previously showed that heterozygous mice with an GENENOTIN mutation in the a3 subunit of GENENOTIN (+/R740S) have mild osteopetrosis resulting from an â¼90% reduction in proton translocation across osteoclast membranes. Here we show that lysosomal pH is also higher in +/GENENOTIN compared with wild-type (+/+) osteoclasts. Both osteoclast number and size were decreased in cultures of +/GENENOTIN compared with +/+ bone marrow cells, with concomitant decreased expression of key osteoclast markers (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN), suggesting that low lysosomal pH plays an important role in osteoclastogenesis. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of this inhibition, GENENOTIN activation was assessed. GENENOTIN nuclear translocation was significantly reduced in +/GENENOTIN compared with +/+ cells; however, this was not because of impaired enzymatic activity of calcineurin, the phosphatase responsible for GENENOTIN dephosphorylation. Protein and RNA expression levels of regulator of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), an endogenous inhibitor of GENENOTIN activation and a protein degraded in lysosomes, were not significantly different between +/GENENOTIN and +/+ osteoclasts, but the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ratio was significantly higher in +/GENENOTIN versus +/+ cells. The lysosomal inhibitor CHEMICALIN significantly increased GENEIN accumulation in +/+ cells, consistent with the hypothesis that higher lysosomal pH impairs GENENOTIN degradation, leading to a higher GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ratio and consequently GENENOTIN inhibition. Our data indicate that increased lysosomal pH in osteoclasts leads to decreased GENENOTIN signaling and nuclear translocation, resulting in a cell autonomous impairment of osteoclastogenesis in vitro.
23539296	GENENOTIN GENENOTIN Regulates the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN to Activate the GENENOTIN Gene. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) regulates hepatic drug metabolism by activating genes such as GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and certain GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is highly activated in human primary hepatocytes but barely in human hepatoma cell-lines including HepG2 cells. Liganded-GENENOTIN induced GENENOTIN mRNA in human primary hepatocytes far more effectively than in HepG2 cells ectopically expressing GENENOTIN. Here, we have now found that activation of GENEIN GENEIN by CHEMICALIN potentiated induction of GENEIN mRNA by GENEIN ligand in HepG2 cells to levels observed in ligand-treated human primary hepatocytes. siRNA knockdown of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN abrogated the ability of CHEMICALIN to synergistically induce GENEIN mRNA. In addition to GENEIN, CHEMICALIN co-treatment potentiated an increase in GENEIN and GENEIN mRNAs but not GENEIN or GENEIN mRNAs. Thus, activated GENENOTIN GENENOTIN is required for liganded-GENENOTIN to selectively activate a set of genes that encode drug metabolizing enzymes. Our present results suggest that GENENOTIN-mediated induction of these enzymes can not be understood by ligand binding alone because the specificity and magnitude of induction are co-determined by a given cell signaling such as GENENOTIN GENENOTIN; both physiological and pathophysiological states of cell signaling may have a strong impact in hepatic drug metabolizing capability during therapeutic treatments.
17549299	Parnaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin, prevents P-selectin-dependent formation of platelet-leukocyte aggregates in human whole blood. Parnaparin, a low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH), prevents platelet activation and interaction with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) in a washed cell system. The in-vitro effect of parnaparin was studied here on platelet-PMN aggregates formed with more physiologic approaches in whole blood, in parallel with unfractionated heparin and enoxaparin, another LMWH. Citrated blood from healthy subjects was stimulated: i) from passage through the "Platelet Function Analyzer" (PFA-100), a device that exposes blood to standardized high shear flow through collagen/ADP cartridges; ii) by collagen and ADP (2 and 50 mug/ml, respectively) added in combination under stirring in an aggregometer cuvette; iii) with recombinant Tissue Factor, to generate thrombin concentrations able to activate platelets without inducing blood clotting, or iv) the Thrombin Receptor Activating Peptide-6 (TRAP-6). Platelet P-selectin and platelet-PMN aggregates were measured by flow cytometry upon stimulation of blood. Fibrinogen binding to platelets and markers of PMN activation were also detected. Platelet P-selectin expression and platelet-PMN aggregate formation were induced in all four activation conditions tested. Parnaparin prevented in a concentration-dependent manner (0.3-0.8 IUaXa/ml) the expression of P-selectin and the formation of mixed aggregates, while the two reference heparin preparations had a much weaker effect. Platelet fibrinogen binding and PMN activation markers (fibrinogen binding, CD11b and CD40) were also prevented by parnaparin. These data extend in more physiological systems of platelet activation, the anti-inflammatory profile of parnaparin, previously reported in washed cells. The greater effect of parnaparin, as compared to the reference heparins, could be due to chemico-physical differences possibly unrelated to their anticoagulant effect.
23505146	Diverse effects of macromolecular crowding on the sequential glycan-processing pathway involved in glycoprotein quality control. Compared with in vitro conditions, the intracellular environment is highly crowded with biomolecules; this has numerous effects on protein functions, including enzymatic activity. We examined the effects of macromolecular crowding on glycan processing of N-glycoprotein in the endoplasmic reticulum as a model sequential metabolic pathway. Experiments with synthetic substrates of physiological glycan structure clearly showed that the first half of the pathway (glucose trimming) was accelerated, whereas the second (mannose trimming) was decelerated under molecular crowding conditions. Furthermore, calreticulin, a lectin-like molecular chaperone, bound more strongly to a glycan-processing intermediate under these conditions. This study demonstrates the diverse effects of molecular crowding on sequential enzymatic processing, and the importance of the effects of macromolecular crowding on in vitro assays for understanding sequential metabolic pathways.
23631374	X-ray structure analysis of a solid solution of milbemycins A3 and A4. Milbemycins A3 and A4 are pharmaceutically and agriculturally useful macrolides isolated from Streptomyces species. The molecular structures of the title compounds were unambiguously established by a single crystal X-ray analysis of the solid solution of both compounds. The crystals present trigonal system, space group P32 with ZÂ =Â 3, unit cell dimensions: aÂ =Â 12.2211(4), cÂ =Â 17.5372(7)Â Ã; VÂ =Â 2268.4(1)Â Ã(3), Î¼Â =Â 0.082Â mm(-Â 1); dÂ =Â 1.183Â gÂ cm(-Â 3). An interesting system of intramolecular hydrogen bonds and weak intermolecular CHâ¦O type hydrogen bond was observed in the solid state.
23609606	In vitro exploration of potential mechanisms of toxicity of the human hepatotoxic drug CHEMICALNOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN NSAID CHEMICALNOTIN exhibited an excellent preclinical safety profile and promising clinical efficacy, yet was withdrawn from clinical development in 1971 due to hepatotoxicity observed in clinical trials. A variety of modern in vitro approaches have been used to explore potential underlying mechanisms. Covalent binding studies were undertaken with CHEMICALNOTIN to investigate the possible role of reactive metabolites. Time-dependent covalent binding to protein was observed in CHEMICALNOTIN-supplemented liver microsomes, although no metabolites were detected in these incubations or in reactive metabolite trapping experiments. In human hepatocytes, covalent binding was observed at lower levels than in microsomes and a minor uncharacterizable metabolite was also observed. In addition, covalent binding was observed in incubations undertaken with dog and rat hepatocytes, where a CHEMICALNOTIN conjugate of the drug was detected. Although an CHEMICALNOTIN metabolite was detected when liver microsomes from human, rat and dog were supplemented with CHEMICALNOTIN, there was no detectable CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent covalent binding. No effects were observed when CHEMICALIN was assessed for GENEIN-dependent and GENEIN-independent cytotoxicity to THLE cell lines, time-dependent inhibition of five major GENEIN enzymes, inhibition of the biliary GENEIN GENEIN and GENEIN or mitochondrial toxicity to THLE or HepG2 cells. These data suggest that Phase 1 bioactivation plays a role in the hepatotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN and highlight the unique insight into mechanisms of human drug toxicity that can be provided by investigations of biotransformation and covalent binding to proteins.
14529460	Mechanism of organophosphates (nerve gases and pesticides) and antidotes: electron transfer and oxidative stress. Evidence indicates that nerve gas toxins operate in ways in addition to inhibition of acetylcholine esterase. Alternative bioactivities are discussed with focus on electron transfer. The main class, including pralidoxime (2-PAM), incorporates conjugated iminium and oxime moieties that are electron affinic. Various physiological properties of iminium and oxime species are reviewed. The organophosphates encompass both nerve gases and insecticides, possessing similar properties, but different activities. Toxic manifestations are apparently due, in part, to oxidative stress. Alkylation of DNA takes place which may lead to generation of reactive oxygen species. Structure-activity relationships are examined, including reduction potentials and the captodative effect.
17034761	CHEMICALIN, as an anti-rheumatic gold compound, suppresses LPS-induced homodimerization of GENEIN. GENENOTIN, which are activated by invading microorganisms or endogenous molecules, evoke immune and inflammatory responses. GENENOTIN activation is closely linked to the development of many chronic inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis. CHEMICALNOTIN, an CHEMICALNOTIN compound, is a well-known and long-used anti-rheumatic drug. However, the mechanism as to how CHEMICALNOTIN relieves the symptom of rheumatoid arthritis has not been fully clarified. Our results demonstrated that CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN-mediated activation of transcription factors, GENEIN and GENEIN, and expression of GENEIN, a pro-inflammatory enzyme. This suppression was well correlated with the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on the homodimerization of GENEIN induced by an agonist. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN activation induced by GENENOTIN-dependent downstream signaling components of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. GENEIN activation induced by GENENOTIN-independent signaling components, GENEIN and GENEIN, was also downregulated by CHEMICALIN. Our results first demonstrate that CHEMICALIN suppresses the multiple steps in GENEIN signaling, especially the homodimerization of GENEIN. The results suggest that the suppression of GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN may be the molecular mechanism through which CHEMICALIN exerts anti-rheumatic activity.
9094999	Differential binding of GENENOTIN to basement membrane heparan CHEMICALNOTIN: comparison of normal and abnormal human tissues. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) play multiple roles during development and in adult tissues as paracrine regulators of growth and differentiation. GENENOTIN signal through GENENOTIN, but heparan CHEMICALIN is also required for signaling by members of the GENEIN family. In addition, heparan sulfate may be involved in determining tissue distribution of GENENOTIN. Using biotinylated GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as probes, we have identified specific interactions between GENEIN and heparan CHEMICALIN in human tissues. Both GENENOTIN species bind to tissue mast cells and to epithelial cell membranes. Binding to basement membrane heparan CHEMICALNOTIN is tissue source dependent and specific. Although GENEIN strongly binds to basement membrane heparan CHEMICALIN in skin and most other tissue sites examined, GENEIN fails to bind to basement membrane heparan CHEMICALIN in most locations. However, in subendothelial matrix in blood vessels and in the basement membrane of a papillary renal cell carcinoma, strong GENENOTIN binding is seen. In summary, distinct and specific affinities of heparan CHEMICALIN for different GENEIN were identified that may affect growth factor activation and local distribution. Heparan CHEMICALNOTIN may have a gatekeeper function to either restrict or permit diffusion of heparin-binding growth factors across the basement membrane.
23584948	CHEMICALNOTIN: opening a new treatment practice in advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma. Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) is frequently diagnosed in a locally advanced or metastatic stage, and 10-year survival rates in these cases are below 20Â %. Cytotoxic chemotherapy has no significant impact on overall or progression-free survival. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN(Â®), AstraZeneca) is a once-daily oral GENEIN inhibitor that selectively inhibits signalling mediated by GENEIN GENEIN (constitutively activated in roughly 60Â % of all MTCs), GENENOTIN, and GENEIN. It is the first systemic drug with demonstrated anti-tumor benefits in advanced MTC, and it has recently been approved for locally advanced or metastatic MTC by the United States Food and Drug Administration (April 2011) and the European Medicines Agency (February 2012). This review, starting from the phases II and III efficacy and safety data that led to these approvals, explores important issues related to dosing, patient selection, and strategies for managing the substantial risk of toxicity associated with the drug (including life-threatening cardiac events that are the subject of a black-box warning in the United States). All these issues still remain to be defined. CHEMICALNOTIN is becoming a standard of care for symptomatic, progressive, metastatic MTCs, to be used selectively in those patients who are likely to benefit from it.
23521080	Potent fibrinolysis inhibitor discovered by shape and electrostatic complementarity to the drug CHEMICALNOTIN. Protein-protein interfaces provide an important class of drug targets currently receiving increased attention. The typical design strategy to inhibit protein-protein interactions usually involves large molecules such as peptides and macrocycles. One exception is CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), which, as a CHEMICALIN mimetic, inhibits binding of GENEIN to GENEIN. However, the daily dose of CHEMICALNOTIN is high due to its modest potency and pharmacokinetic properties. In this study, we report a computational approach, where the focus was on finding electrostatic potential similarities to CHEMICALNOTIN. Coupling this computational technique with a high-quality low-throughput screen identified CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) as a potent GENEIN binding inhibitor with the potential for the treatment of various bleeding disorders. Remarkably, CHEMICALNOTIN was found to be more than four times as potent as the drug CHEMICALNOTIN.
16835395	Gene deletion reveals roles for GENENOTIN in the regulation of lipolysis and GENENOTIN release in epididymal adipose tissue. In this study, epididymal adipose tissue from male GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-null and wild-type control mice were used to explore the potential role of GENENOTIN in adipocyte biology. GENENOTIN was detected by Western blot analysis in wild-type tissue and localized predominantly to the stromal-vascular compartment. Epididymal fat pad mass was reduced by GENENOTIN gene deletion, but adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting that GENENOTIN is required for the maintenance of adipocyte and/or preadipocyte cell number. Epididymal tissue from wild-type mice responded in vitro to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN with increased CHEMICALNOTIN release, reduced GENEIN release, and increased CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation. Qualitatively similar but significantly attenuated responses to the CHEMICALIN were observed in tissue from GENENOTIN-null mice, an effect that was not associated with changes in GENEIN mRNA expression. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) also stimulated lipolysis in vitro, but its effects were muted by GENENOTIN gene deletion. By contrast, LPS failed to influence GENENOTIN release from wild-type tissue but stimulated the release of the GENENOTIN from tissue from GENENOTIN-null mice. GENENOTIN gene deletion did not affect GENENOTIN expression or the ability of CHEMICALNOTIN to suppress CHEMICALNOTIN-induced lipolysis. It did, however, augment GENENOTIN expression and modify the inhibitory effects of glucocorticoids on GENENOTIN release. Collectively, these studies suggest that GENENOTIN supports aspects of adipose tissue mass and alters the sensitivity of epididymal adipose tissue to CHEMICALNOTIN, glucocorticoids, and LPS, thereby modulating lipolysis and GENENOTIN release.
10207608	GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN (GENEIN) expression in murine primary splenocytes. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has been postulated to play a role in the regulation of GENENOTIN expression. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the effects of GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on GENEIN (GENEIN) expression in murine primary splenocytes. Pretreatment of the splenocytes with both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN suppressed CHEMICALIN plus ionomycin-induced GENEIN secretion in a concentration-dependent manner. Inhibition > 90% of GENEIN secretion was observed at 1 microM CHEMICALIN and 10 microM CHEMICALIN compared to the respective vehicle control. Likewise, GENEIN steady-state mRNA expression was inhibited by both GENEIN inhibitors in a concentration-dependent fashion with > 90% inhibition at 1 microM CHEMICALIN and 20 microM CHEMICALIN. Taken together, these data demonstrated that GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are robust inhibitors of GENEIN expression at both the mRNA and protein levels in murine splenocytes. Moreover, these findings suggest that drugs and chemicals which inhibit GENENOTIN may have marked effects on T-cell function.
23127916	Polymorphisms in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transporters genes are associated with prolonged time to progression in unresectable gastrointestinal stromal tumours treated with CHEMICALNOTIN therapy. The two basic mainstays of gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) treatment are surgery and CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN inhibitor that allows achieving a stable or responding disease in about 80% of patients with unresectable/metastatic GIST. Response to CHEMICALNOTIN mainly depends from GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mutational status. Nevertheless, some patients with a potentially responsive genotype do not respond, and others develop a pattern of resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN which is not associated with secondary mutations. This emphasizes the presence of mechanisms of resistance other than the receptor-related genotype, and the need of biological predictors to select the optimal therapeutic strategy, particularly now that other potent inhibitors are available. We investigated a panel of 31 polymorphisms in 11 genes, potentially associated with the pharmacogenetics of CHEMICALNOTIN, in a group of 54 unresectable/metastatic GISTs treated with CHEMICALNOTIN 400mg daily as first line therapy. Included in this analysis were polymorphisms in the transporters' family GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and in the metabolizing genes GENENOTIN. Time to progression was significantly improved in presence of the C allele in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN rs1050152), and the two minor alleles (G) in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN rs2631367 and rs2631372). Importantly, multivariate analysis, adjusting for age, gender, GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN mutational status, and tumour size, revealed that all the three genotypes maintained independent predictive significance. In conclusion, in this study we showed that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genotypes may be an important predictor of time to progression in GIST patients receiving CHEMICALNOTIN therapy. Further investigations are required in an attempt to further personalize GIST therapy.
23238657	Acute Macrovascular Dysfunction in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Induced by Ingestion of Advanced Glycated Î²-Lactoglobulins. OBJECTIVE Recent evidence indicates that heat-enhanced food advanced glycation end products (AGEs) adversely affect vascular function. The aim of this study was to examine the acute effects of an oral load of heat-treated, AGE-modified Î²-lactoglobulins (AGE-BLG) compared with heat-treated, nonglycated BLG (C-BLG) on vascular function in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS In a double-blind, controlled, randomized, crossover study, 19 patients with T2DM received, on two different occasions, beverages containing either AGE-BLG or C-BLG. We measured macrovascular [brachial ultrasound of flow-mediated dilatation (FMD)] and microvascular (laser-Doppler measurements of reactive hyperemia in the hand) functions at baseline (T0), 90 (T90), and 180 (T180) min. RESULTS Following the AGE-BLG, FMD decreased at T90 by 80% from baseline and remained decreased by 42% at T180 (P < 0.05 vs. baseline, P < 0.05 vs. C-BLG at T90). By comparison, following C-BLG, FMD decreased by 27% at T90 and 51% at T180 (P < 0.05 vs. baseline at T180). A significant decrease in nitrite (T180) and nitrate (T90 and T180), as well as a significant increase in N(Îµ)-carboxymethyllisine, accompanied intake of AGE-BLG. There was no change in microvascular function caused by either beverage. CONCLUSIONS In patients with T2DM, acute oral administration of a single AGE-modified protein class significantly though transiently impaired macrovascular function in concert with decreased nitric oxide bioavailability. These AGE-related changes were independent of heat treatment.
23477570	In situ forming reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels for facile loading and triggered intracellular release of proteins. In situ forming reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels were designed and developed based on poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(2-(hydroxyethyl) methacrylate-co-acryloyl carbonate) (PEG-P(HEMA-co-AC)) block copolymers for efficient loading as well as triggered intracellular release of proteins. PEG-P(HEMA-co-AC) copolymers were prepared with controlled Mn of 9.1, 9.5, and 9.9 kg/mol and varying numbers of AC units per molecule of 7, 9 and 11, respectively (denoted as copolymer 1, 2, and 3) by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer copolymerization. These copolymers were freely soluble in phosphate buffer but formed disulfide-cross-linked nanogels with defined sizes ranging from 72.5 to 124.1 nm in the presence of cystamine via ring-opening reaction with cyclic carbonate groups. The sizes of nanogels decreased with increasing AC units as a result of increased cross-linking density. Dynamic light scattering studies showed that these nanogels though stable at physiological conditions were rapidly dissociated in response to 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Interestingly, FITC-labeled cytochrome C (FITC-CC) could be readily loaded into nanogels with remarkable loading efficiencies (up to 98.2%) and loading contents (up to 48.2 wt.%). The in vitro release studies showed that release of FITC-CC was minimal under physiological conditions but significantly enhanced under reductive conditions in the presence of 10 mM DTT with about 96.8% of FITC-CC released in 22 h from nanogel 1. In contrast, protein release from 1,4-butanediamine cross-linked nanogels (reduction-insensitive control) remained low under otherwise the same conditions. MTT assays showed that these nanogels were nontoxic to HeLa cells up to a tested concentration of 2 mg/mL. Confocal microscopy results showed that nanogel 1 delivered and released FITC-CC into the perinuclei region of HeLa cells following 8 h incubation. CC-loaded reductively degradable nanogels demonstrated apparently better apoptotic activity than free CC as well as reduction-insensitive controls. These in situ forming, surfactant and oil-free, and reduction-sensitive degradable nanogels are highly promising for targeted protein therapy.
16972995	Brugada syndrome. A novel clinical entity characterized by ST segment elevation in right precordial leads (V1 to V3), incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, and susceptibility to ventricular tachyarrhythmia and sudden cardiac death has been described by Brugada et al. in 1992. This disease is now frequently called "Brugada syndrome" (BrS). The prevalence of BrS in the general population is unknown. The suggested prevalence ranges from 5/1,000 (Caucasians) to 14/1,000 (Japanese). Syncope, typically occurring at rest or during sleep (in individuals in their third or fourth decades of life) is a common presentation of BrS. In some cases, tachycardia does not terminate spontaneously and it may degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and lead to sudden death. Both sporadic and familial cases have been reported and pedigree analysis suggests an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. In approximately 20% of the cases BrS is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene on chromosome 3p21-23, encoding the cardiac sodium channel, a protein involved in the control of myocardial excitability. Since the use of the implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is the only therapeutic option of proven efficacy for primary and secondary prophylaxis of cardiac arrest, the identification of high-risk subjects is one of the major goals in the clinical decision-making process. Quinidine may be regarded as an adjunctive therapy for patients at higher risk and may reduce the number of cases of ICD shock in patients with multiple recurrences.
22878908	CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) affect osteoblast viability and biomarkers independently of the CHEMICALIN effects on GENEIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) are GENEIN sensitizers used for treatment of diabetes. We have previously reported that CHEMICALIN reduce CHEMICALIN synthesis by inhibiting GENEIN activity in human granulosa cells (HGC). Multiple clinical trials demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN increase the risk of fractures in postmenopausal women with type 2 diabetes. We studied mouse osteoblasts alone or in a co-culture with HGC to determine whether CHEMICALIN inhibition of GENEIN plays a role in their effects on bone metabolism. Mouse osteoblasts were cultured with and without HGC, and incubated in a medium with or without CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. Cell growth, oleic acid uptake, GENENOTIN activity, and GENENOTIN production were measured. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN production by up to 84% in HGC/mouse osteoblast co-cultures. CHEMICALNOTIN induced mouse osteoblast death and increased CHEMICALNOTIN uptake. CHEMICALIN also inhibited GENEIN activity (58-75%, p<0.046) and GENEIN production (52-75%, p<0.031). For all the parameters, there were no significant differences between the osteoblast cultures alone and the HCG/osteoblast co-cultures. CHEMICALIN effects on osteoblast viability, oleic acid uptake, GENEIN and GENEIN production are independent of their effects on GENEIN.
15199474	GENEIN, a new platelet GENEIN, target of CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is a potent antithrombotic drug that inhibits CHEMICALNOTIN-induced platelet aggregation. The results of large clinical trials have demonstrated an overall benefit of CHEMICALNOTIN over CHEMICALNOTIN in the prevention of vascular ischemic events (myocardial infarction, stroke, vascular death) in patients with a history of symptomatic atherosclerotic disease. The antiaggregating effect of CHEMICALIN is attributed to an irreversible inhibition of CHEMICALIN binding to a GENEIN present at the platelet surface. CHEMICALNOTIN is not active in vitro and can be considered a precursor of an active metabolite formed in the liver. The chemical structure of this active metabolite and its biological activity have been described recently. Several GENEIN have been described on platelets; GENEIN, a GENEIN, and GENEIN a GENEIN, have been found not to be antagonized by CHEMICALIN. Another GENENOTIN (named GENENOTIN) has been recently cloned and stably expressed in CHO cells. These cells displayed a strong affinity for CHEMICALNOTIN, a stable analogue of CHEMICALNOTIN, the binding characteristics of which corresponded in all points to those observed on platelets. The binding of CHEMICALNOTIN to these cells was strongly inhibited by the active metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN with a potency that was consistent with that observed for this compound on platelets. In these transfected CHO cells, as in platelets, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN induced CHEMICALNOTIN cyclase downregulation, an effect that was inhibited by the active metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN. These results demonstrate that this receptor corresponds to the previously called "GENEIN" GENEIN and show that the active metabolite of CHEMICALIN binds in a covalent manner to this receptor, thus explaining how it blocks the aggregating effect of CHEMICALIN on platelets.
15155769	Redesign of GENENOTIN specificity by protein engineering. In eukaryotes, CHEMICALNOTIN is involved in energy metabolism by facilitating beta-oxidation of CHEMICALNOTIN. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyze the reversible conversion of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN and free CoA. To redesign the specificity of GENENOTIN toward its substrates, we mutated Met564. The GENEIN mutated GENEIN showed higher activity toward longer chain CHEMICALIN: activity toward CHEMICALIN was 1250-fold higher than that of the wild-type GENEIN, and lower activity toward its natural substrate, CHEMICALIN. Kinetic constants of the mutant GENEIN showed modification in favor of longer CHEMICALIN as substrates. In the reverse case, mutation of the orthologous GENENOTIN in GENEIN (GENEIN) decreased activity toward its natural substrates, medium- and long-chain CHEMICALIN, and increased activity toward short-chain CHEMICALIN. Another GENENOTIN mutant, GENENOTIN, was prepared and tested in the same way, with similar results. We conclude that Met564 blocks the entry of medium- and long-chain CHEMICALIN to the catalytic site of GENEIN. Three-dimensional models of wild-type and mutated GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN support this hypothesis. We show for the first time that a single CHEMICALIN is able to determine the substrate specificity of GENEIN and GENEIN.
2226440	Cooperative homotropic interaction of CHEMICALIN with the catalytic site of GENEIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) are potent inhibitors of GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN). The amines bind to the enzyme by a direct coordination to the high-spin (S = 5/2) Fe(III) at the active site (charge transfer interaction), as seen by resonance Raman and EPR spectroscopy. Experimental evidence is presented that a group with an apparent pKa value of about 5.1 (20 degrees C) is involved in the interaction between the CHEMICALNOTIN and the enzyme. The high-affinity binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN, as studied by equilibrium microdialysis (anaerobically) and ultrafiltration (aerobically), shows positive cooperativity (h = 1.9); at pH 7.2 and 20 degrees C the rat enzyme binds about 0.5 mol CHEMICALIN/mol subunit with a half-maximal binding (S50) at 0.25 microM CHEMICALIN. No binding to the ferrous form of the enzyme was observed. The affinity decreases with decreasing pH, by phosphorylation and by preincubation of the enzyme with the substrate CHEMICALNOTIN, while it increases after alkylation of the enzyme with the activator CHEMICALNOTIN. Preincubation of the enzyme with CHEMICALNOTIN also leads to a complete loss of the cooperativity of CHEMICALNOTIN binding (h = 1.0). The many similarities in binding properties of the inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN and the activator/substrate CHEMICALNOTIN makes it likely that the cooperative interactions of these effectors are due to their binding to the same site. The high-affinity of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN is a valuable probe to study the active site of this enzyme and is also relevant for the homologous enzyme GENEIN, which is purified as a stable CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN complex.
23640283	The design and realization of a large-area flexible nanofiber-based mat for pollutant degradation: an application in photocatalysis. This work demonstrates a novel multifunctional nanofibrous mat for photocatalytic applications based on TiO2 nanocables functionalized by Ag nanoparticles and coated with a thin (â¼2 nm) graphitic shell. In this mat, which was realized by an electrospinning technique, each component serves a unique function: the carbon coating acts as both an adsorption material for capturing pollutants and as a charge-transfer material, the Ag nanoparticles act as a visible-light sensitizing agent and also as a charge-transfer material, finally the TiO2 nanocable mat acts as a UV sensitive photocatalytic matrix and as the flexible substrate for the other functional components. This multicomponent nanocable mat exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity under simulated solar irradiation for the degradation of model pollutants including RhB and phenol. The significant photocatalytic properties are attributed to the synergetic effect of the three functional components and the unique charge transport "freeway" property of the nanofibrous mat. In addition, the porous carbon coating infiltrated into the nanocable matrix endows the mat with excellent flexibility and enables robust, large-area (10 Ã 10 cm) fabrication, representing a significant advantage over previous brittle ceramic nanofibrous mat photocatalyst substrates. This study provides new insight into the design and preparation of an advanced, yet commercially practical and scaleable photocatalytic composite membrane material. The as-prepared photocatalytic mat might also be of interest in solar cell, catalysis, separation technology, biomedical engineering, and nanotechnology.
23256725	The effects of GENENOTIN in human reproductive function - therapeutic implications. GENEIN is a 54-CHEMICALIN peptide which is encoded by the GENENOTIN gene and activates the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. Evidence suggests that this system is a key regulator of mammalian and human reproduction. Animal studies have shown that GENENOTIN-deficient mice have abnormal sexual development. Central and peripheral administration of GENEIN stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis whilst pre-administration of a CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) antagonist abolishes this effect. In humans, inactivating GENENOTIN mutations cause normosmic hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism whilst activation of GENENOTIN signalling is associated with premature puberty. In healthy human volunteers, the acute intravenous administration of kisspeptin potently increases plasma GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) levels and significantly increases plasma GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN without side effects in both males and in females particularly in the preovulatatory phase of the menstrual cycle. In infertility due to hypothalamic amenorrhoea acute administration of GENENOTIN results in stimulation of reproductive hormones. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN system therefore appears to play an important role in the regulation of reproduction in humans. Hence GENENOTIN has potential as a novel tool for the manipulation of the HPG axis and treatment of infertility in humans. This review discusses the evidence highlighting GENENOTIN key role in human reproduction.
12188035	Species-specific differences in the GENEIN transactivation function upon binding with CHEMICALIN. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are the most effective drugs for anti-inflammatory diseases. A number of adverse side effects, however, limit chronic treatment with GCs. To improve their therapeutic usefulness, attempts have been made to dissociate the two main actions of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), transactivation and transrepression, which are believed to be responsible for the side effects and anti-inflammatory effects, respectively. We report here species-specific differences in the transactivation response mediated by GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and their esterified-derivatives had full transrepression agonistic activity in a reporter assay using CV-1 cells transfected with either GENEIN. These GCs also had full transactivation agonistic activity in CV-1 cells transfected with GENENOTIN. The esterified-CHEMICALIN, however, had only partial transactivation agonistic activity in cells transfected with GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALIN and esterified-CHEMICALIN had full transactivation agonistic activity. Moreover, in rat hepatoma H4-II-E cells, the esterified-CHEMICALIN failed to induce GENEIN, which is regulated by GENEIN-mediated transactivation activity. There were no significant differences between the binding affinity of these GCs to GENENOTIN. Consistent with the weak transactivation activity of esterified-CHEMICALIN mediated by GENEIN, there were few side effects, evaluated by thymus involution and body weight loss, in an antigen-induced asthmatic model in rats. These results suggest that the potency of esterified-CHEMICALNOTIN to induce transactivation activity is different between species and that this difference is not due to differences in receptor binding.
1322791	Amsacrine and etoposide hypersensitivity of yeast cells overexpressing DNA topoisomerase II. Increasing the cellular concentration of DNA topoisomerase II in yeast by expressing constitutively a plasmid-borne TOP2 gene encoding the enzyme greatly increases the sensitivity of the cells to amsacrine and etoposide (VP-16). This increased drug sensitivity at a higher intracellular DNA topoisomerase II level is observed in both RAD52+ repair-proficient strains and rad52 mutants that are defective in the repair of double-stranded breaks. These results provide strong support of the hypothesis that the cellular target of these drugs is DNA topoisomerase II, and that these drugs kill cells by converting DNA topoisomerase II into a DNA damaging agent.
11089538	Characterization of GENENOTIN in human prostate epithelial cells: potential roles for GENENOTIN in senescence of the prostatic epithelium. GENEIN (GENEIN) are newly described CHEMICALIN-rich proteins that share significant aminoterminal structural similarity with the conventional GENENOTIN and are involved in a diversity of biological functions, including growth regulation. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) is a potential tumor-suppressor gene that is differentially expressed in meningiomas, mammary and prostatic cancers, compared with their malignant counterparts. We have previously shown that GENENOTIN is preferentially produced by primary cultures of human prostate epithelial cells (HPECs) and by poorly tumorigenic P69SV40T cells, compared with the cancerous prostatic LNCaP, DU145, PC-3, and M12 cells. We now show that GENENOTIN increases during senescence of HPEC. GENENOTIN (also known as GENENOTIN), a downstream effector of GENENOTIN and modulator of growth for both fibroblasts and endothelial cells, was detected in most of the normal and malignant prostatic epithelial cells tested, with a marked up-regulation of GENENOTIN during senescence of HPEC. Moreover, GENEIN noticeably increased in response to GENENOTIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) in HPEC and PC-3 cells, and it decreased in response to GENENOTIN in HPEC. GENENOTIN [GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)], the protein product of the GENENOTIN protooncogene, was not detected in HPEC but was expressed in the tumorigenic DU145 and PC-3 cells. It was also synthesized by the SV40-T antigen-transformed P69 and malignant M12 cells, where it was down-regulated by CHEMICALNOTIN. These observations suggest biological roles of GENENOTIN in the human prostate. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are likely to negatively regulate growth, because they seem to increase during senescence of the prostate epithelium and in response to growth inhibitors (GENENOTIN and atRA). Although the data collected on GENEIN in prostate are modest, its role as a growth stimulator and/or protooncogene is supported by its preferential expression in cancerous cells and its down-regulation by CHEMICALIN.
15921304	[Disorders with eosinophilia, treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome]. Eosinophilia may be associated with reactive conditions and with clonal disorders of the hematopoietic cells. The hypereosinophilic syndrome takes an intermedier place in this group. In this disease a sustained eosinophilia with end organ damage can occur. The author summarized the diagnostic procedures and differential diagnosis in the group of these diseases focusing on characteristics and treatment of hypereosinophilic syndrome. The treatment has been varied and included CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN, and in some cases chemotherapy. On the basis of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN fusion gene hypereosinophilic syndrome would be classified as a clonal disease and in the GENEIN-GENEIN positive cases the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (Glivec) would be effective.
23327877	Transport by GENEIN and GENEIN enhances the cytotoxicity of CHEMICALIN and several CHEMICALIN derivatives. GENENOTIN are transporters that are expressed selectively in human hepatocytes under normal conditions. GENENOTIN is also expressed in certain cancers. CHEMICALIN such as green tea CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN have been shown to modulate the function of some GENEIN. In the present study, the extent to which six substituted CHEMICALIN derivatives (1-6) affected the function of GENEIN and GENEIN was investigated. Uptake of the radiolabeled model substrates CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) was determined in the absence and presence of compounds 1-6 using Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably expressing either GENEIN or GENEIN. Several of compounds 1-6 inhibited GENENOTIN-mediated uptake of all three model substrates, suggesting that they could also be potential substrates. Compound 6 stimulated GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN uptake by increasing the apparent affinity of GENEIN for its substrate. Cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and most of compounds 1-6 killed preferentially GENEIN-expressing CHO cells. CHEMICALNOTIN, 1, and 3 were the most potent cytotoxic compounds, with CHEMICALIN and 3 selectively killing GENEIN-expressing cells. Given that GENENOTIN is expressed in several cancers, CHEMICALNOTIN and some of the CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives studied might be promising lead compounds for the development of novel anticancer drugs.
23192350	Silencing GENENOTIN in human leukocytes reveals a role for GENENOTIN enzyme during GENENOTIN-mediated cell adhesion. Leukocyte adhesion during inflammation is initiated by the binding of sialofucosylated CHEMICALNOTIN expressed on leukocytes to endothelial GENENOTIN. Although the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) constructing GENENOTIN-ligands have largely been identified using knock-out mice, important differences may exist between humans and mice. To address this, we developed a systematic lentivirus-based shRNA delivery workflow to create human leukocytic HL-60 cell lines that lack up to three GENENOTIN. Using this, the contributions of all three myeloid GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) to GENENOTIN-ligand biosynthesis were evaluated. The cell adhesion properties of these modified cells to GENENOTIN under hydrodynamic shear were compared with bone marrow-derived neutrophils from GENENOTIN(-/-)GENENOTIN(-/-) dual knock-out mice. Results demonstrate that predominantly GENENOTIN, and to a lesser extent GENENOTIN, forms the GENENOTIN-ligand at the CHEMICALIN terminus of leukocyte GENEIN (GENENOTIN) in humans and mice. Here, 85% reduction in leukocyte interaction was observed in GENENOTIN(-) dual knockdowns on GENENOTIN substrates. Unlike GENENOTIN(-/-)GENENOTIN(-/-) mouse neutrophils, however, human knockdowns lacking GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN only exhibited partial reduction in rolling interaction on GENENOTIN. In this case, the third GENENOTIN GENENOTIN played an important role because leukocyte adhesion was reduced by 50-60% in GENENOTIN-HL-60, 70-80% in dual knockdown GENENOTIN(-) cells, and â¼85% in GENENOTIN(-) triple knockdowns. Gene silencing results are in agreement with gain-of-function experiments where all three GENENOTIN conferred GENENOTIN-mediated rolling in HEK293T cells. This study advances new tools to study GENENOTIN function. It suggests a species-specific role for GENENOTIN during the biosynthesis of GENENOTIN ligands.
23017392	Optimization of frozen sour cherries vacuum drying process. The objective of this research was to optimize the vacuum-drying of frozen sour cherries in order to preserve health-beneficial phytochemicals, as well as textural characteristics. Investigated range of temperature was 46-74Â°C and, of pressure, 17-583mbar, in a new design of vacuum-dryer equipment. The total solids, a(w) value, total phenolics, vitamin C, antioxidant activity, anthocyanin content, total colour change and firmness were used as quality indicators of dried sour cherry. Within the experimental range of studied variables, the optimum conditions of 54.03Â°C and 148.16mbar were established for vacuum drying of sour cherry. Separate validation experiments were conducted, under optimum conditions, to verify predictions and adequacy of the second-order polynomial models. Under these optimal conditions, the predicted amount of total phenolics was 744mg CAE/100 dw, vitamin C 1.44mg/100g per dry weight (g dw), anthocyanin content 125mg/100g dw, IC(50) 3.23mg/ml, total solids 70.72%, a(w) value 0.646, total colour change 52.61 and firmness 3395.4g. The investigated parameters had a significant effect on the quality of the dried sour cherries.
8242725	GENEIN imaging with CHEMICALIN SPECT in migraine patients abusing CHEMICALIN: does CHEMICALNOTIN cross the blood brain barrier? Two migraine patients were studied by in vivo SPECT using the GENEIN specific radioligand CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) during CHEMICALIN abuse and after withdrawal. Results were compared with 15 healthy controls. Striatum/cerebellum and striatum/occipital cortex ratios of count rate density were calculated as a semiquantitative measurement for striatal GENENOTIN binding potential. No differences were found in striatal uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN between healthy controls and the patients when on or off CHEMICALNOTIN. Preliminary evidence suggests that CHEMICALIN may not occupy striatal GENEIN to a large extent and thus may not cross the blood brain barrier in large quantities.
16633143	CHEMICALNOTIN versus CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of motor vehicle accident-related posttraumatic stress disorder: a double-blind, fixed-dosage, controlled trial. BACKGROUND: Motor vehicle accidents (MVAs) are a leading cause of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the general population. Alterations in CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN systems have been proposed as mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of the condition, with treatment directed at these neurotransmitter systems. CHEMICALIN, a selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor, exhibits high affinity and selectivity for the GENEIN. Inasmuch as PTSD may be associated with dysregulation of noradrenergic activity, the present double-blind randomized clinical trial intended to evaluate reboxetine's efficacy in the management of MVA-related PTSD and to compare its efficacy with a medication commonly used in PTSD, the selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN. METHODS: Forty patients with MVA-related PTSD attending a local community mental health outpatient clinic were randomized to receive a fixed dose of either CHEMICALNOTIN (8 mg/d) or CHEMICALNOTIN (150 mg/d) in a double-blind fashion for a period of 8 weeks. RESULTS: At baseline and at study end point, the 2 subgroups demonstrated no statistical differences in scores on PTSD, depression, and anxiety rating scales. Both medications led to significant improvements in all clinical scales measured. Nine patients receiving CHEMICALNOTIN and 3 receiving CHEMICALNOTIN withdrew from the study because of side effects. CONCLUSIONS: Study observations indicate comparable efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in the management of MVA-related PTSD despite reboxetine's selective noradrenergic activity. CHEMICALNOTIN appears to be at least as effective as CHEMICALNOTIN and may offer an alternative management option in this often difficult-to-treat and disabling condition. A lower and flexible CHEMICALNOTIN dosing schedule will be recommended for future research to improve its tolerability in PTSD patients.
22820907	Current understanding of TRPM7 pharmacology and drug development for stroke. The initial excitement and countless efforts to find a pharmacological agent that disrupts the excitotoxic pathway of ischemic neuronal death have only led to disappointing clinical trials. Currently, a thrombolytic agent called recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rt-PA) is the only pharmacological treatment available for patients with acute ischemic stroke in most countries. Even though its efficacy has been confirmed repeatedly, rt-PA is considerably underused due to reasons including a short therapeutic window and repeated complications associated with its use. A search for alternative mechanisms that may operate dependently or independently with the well-established excitotoxic mechanism has led researchers to the discovery of newly described non-glutamate mechanisms. Among the latter, transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) is one of the important nonglutamate mechanisms in stroke, which has been evaluated in both in-vitro and in-vivo. In this review, we will discuss the current state of pharmacological treatments of ischemic stroke and provide evidence that TRPM7 is a promising therapeutic target of stroke.
17616291	Analgesic and anti-inflammatory activities of aqueous extract from Glycine tomentella root in mice. In the present study, we have investigated the analgesic effect of the aqueous extract of the root of Glycine tomentella (AGT) using models of acetic acid-induced writhing response and formalin test, the anti-inflammatory effect of AGT using model of lambda-carrageenan-induced paw edema. In order to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanism of AGT, we have detected the activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione reductase (GRx) in the liver and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and NO in the edema paw. In the analgesic test, AGT (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) decreased the acetic acid-induced writhing response and the licking time on the late phase in the formalin test. In the anti-inflammatory test, AGT (0.5 and 1.0 g/kg) decreased the paw edema at the third, fourth, fifth and sixth hour after lambda-carrageenan administration, and increased the activities of SOD, GPx and GRx in the liver tissue and decreased the MDA level in the edema paw at the third hour after lambda-carrageenan injection. However, AGT could not affect the NO level which induced by lambda-carrageenan. These results suggested that AGT possessed analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects. The anti-inflammatory mechanism of AGT might be related to the decrease in the level of MDA in the edema paw via increasing the activities of SOD, GPx and GRx in the liver.
23560442	Enhancing Raman Scattering without Plasmons: Unprecedented Sensitivity Achieved by TiO2 Shell-Based Resonators. A remarkable enhancement of Raman scattering is achieved by TiO2 shell-based spherical resonators in the absence of plasmonic enhancers. This effect is ascribed to the synergistic combination of high refractive index of the shell layer, multiple light scattering through the spheres, and related geometrical factors and can be exploited to fabricate a new generation of self-diagnostic, recyclable SERS-active substrates.
23473681	Degradation of CHEMICALNOTIN and studies of the interaction of resulting CHEMICALIN compounds with the GENEIN targeting GENEIN GENEIN. The discovery of novel small molecules that function as antibacterial agents or cellular probes of biology is hindered by our limited understanding of bacterial physiology and our ability to assign mechanism of action. We previously employed a chemical genomic strategy to identify a novel small molecule, CHEMICALIN, as a likely inhibitor of the GENEIN targeting GENEIN, GENEIN. Here, we report on the degradation of CHEMICALNOTIN into the active species, CHEMICALNOTIN. Analogs of this compound (e.g., A22) have previously been characterized as inhibitors of the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN. Herein, we demonstrate that the antibacterial activity of CHEMICALNOTIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN compounds are similar; these activities are suppressed or sensitized in response to increases or decreases of GENENOTIN copy number, respectively. We provide STD NMR data which confirms a physical interaction between GENEIN and the CHEMICALIN degradation product of CHEMICALIN, with a Kd of ~150 Î¼M. Taken together, we conclude that the CHEMICALIN series of compounds share a similar cellular mechanism that includes interaction with GENEIN in addition to the well-characterized target GENEIN.
14767264	GENENOTIN and their inhibitors in lower urinary tract symptoms and benign prostatic hyperplasia. PURPOSE: We provide a comprehensive overview of the role of GENENOTINs (GENENOTIN) as critical mediators of lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and pathophysiology in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and we review the pharmacological antagonists of GENENOTIN. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A review was performed of pertinent studies in the literature relating to the pathophysiology of LUTS and BPH, focusing on the role of GENENOTIN, and of clinical trial and practice data evaluating the different agents that inhibit these receptors. RESULTS: Further characterization of the GENENOTIN gene family indicates that 3 receptor subtypes exist in humans. Their different distribution between urinary tract and cardiovascular tissues has provided a strategy for the development of improved therapeutic agents. Since excessive activity of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subtypes appears to be a common feature in symptomatic BPH and GENENOTIN are enriched in prostatic tissue, drugs that demonstrate high GENENOTIN selectivity have attracted attention. CHEMICALIN, which has high affinity for GENEIN and GENEIN subtypes but not for GENEIN, shows efficacy similar to the nonsubtype selective agents CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. It is associated with fewer cardiovascular side effects, although it has some ejaculatory side effects. The nonsubtype selective agent CHEMICALNOTIN also demonstrates efficacy and offers an enhanced side effect profile, particularly minimizing hypotension. Other agents with super selective specificity for the GENENOTIN subtype are under investigation. CONCLUSIONS: Further advances in the treatment of LUTS associated with BPH may depend not only on receptor subtype selectivity, but also on other pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.
23391485	Effect of low dose CHEMICALNOTIN on the early differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into mammary epithelial cells. It has been previously reported that CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) can disturb the development of mammary structure and increase the risk of breast cancer in experimental animals. In this study, an in vitro model of human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation into mammary epithelial cells was applied to investigate the effect of low dose CHEMICALNOTIN on the early stages of mammogenesis. A newly established hESC line was directionally differentiated into mammary epithelial cells by a well-established three-dimensional (3D) culture system. The differentiated mammary epithelial cells were characterized by immunofluorescence and western blotting assay, and were called induced differentiated mammary epithelial cells (iDMECs) based on these data. The hESCs were treated with low doses of CHEMICALNOTIN range 10(-9)-10(-6)M during the differentiation process, with CHEMICALNOTIN as the solvent control and CHEMICALNOTIN (E2) as the estrogen-positive control. Our results showed that low dose CHEMICALIN and E2 could influence the mammosphere area of iDMECs and upregulate the expression level of GENEIN and GENEIN proteins, while only CHEMICALIN could downregulate the expression of GENEIN protein. Taken together, this study provides some insights into the effects of low dose CHEMICALNOTIN on the early differentiation stage of mammary epithelial cells and suggests an easier canceration status of iDMECs under the effect of low dose CHEMICALNOTIN during its early differentiation stage.
23473804	Absence of correlation between CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation in GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN increase, and apoptosis induction on 158N murine oligodendrocytes. There is some evidence that oxidized derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), are increased in the plasma of patients with neurodegenerative diseases associated with demyelinization of the central nervous system (CNS). It was therefore of interest to investigate the effects of these CHEMICALNOTIN on oligodendrocytes, the myelin-forming cells in the CNS. To this end, 158N murine oligodendrocytes were treated with CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN inducing an apoptotic mode of cell death characterized by condensation/fragmentation of the nuclei, dephosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN, mitochondrial depolarization involving GENEIN, and GENEIN activation. In contrast, under treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN (27OHC), no cell death was observed. When the cells were stained with CHEMICALNOTIN, no significant CHEMICALNOTIN rise was found with the different CHEMICALNOTIN, whereas strong signals were detected with CHEMICALNOTIN used as positive control. At concentrations which induced apoptosis, CHEMICALNOTIN but not CHEMICALNOTIN accumulated in lipid rafts. Although not cytotoxic, CHEMICALNOTIN was mainly detected in lipid rafts. It is noteworthy that CHEMICALNOTIN (but not CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) was able to counteract CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis and to decrease the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in lipid rafts. Thus, in 158N cells, the ability of CHEMICALIN to trigger a mode of cell death by apoptosis involving GENEIN and GENEIN activation is independent of the increase in the CHEMICALNOTIN level and of their accumulation in lipid raft microdomains.
22991330	Can peripheral blood Î³Î´ T cells predict osteonecrosis of the jaw? An immunological perspective on the adverse drug effects of aminobisphosphonate therapy. Nitrogen-bisphosphonates (n-BP), often referred to as aminobisphosphonates, are the most commonly prescribed drugs for the treatment of disorders of bone fragility. However, long-term continuous treatment predisposes certain individuals to serious rare side effects, such as bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis of the jaw (BAONJ). n-BP use is known to unintentionally activate a subset of innate T cells called VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells, but the consequence of this chronic immune stimulation has remained unexplored. The primary objectives of this study were to 1) determine the fate of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells in osteoporotic patients on n-BP therapy as a function of time and type of therapy; 2) evaluate the proportion of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells in patients who had recently experienced n-BP-associated ONJ. We found there is a notable loss of VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells over time in osteoporotic patients on n-BP therapy, particularly those on intravenous (iv) therapy (Spearman râ=â-0.55, pâ<â0.0001 iv; râ=â-0.3, pâ<â0.03 oral) (nâ=â68); no difference was observed in total T cells, monocytes, or granulocytes. Importantly, the observed negative effect on VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells coincides with the reported route of administration and timing of the rare occurrence of BAONJ. Patients (nâ=â6) who had experienced BAONJ were all found to be significantly deficient in VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells (medianâ=â0.07%) in comparison to age- and sex-matched treatment-naÃ¯ve controls (Nâ=â11; medianâ=â2.40%), Uâ=â0, pâ=â0.001; this was the only consistent difference in the leukocytes assessed. All BAONJ cases had an underlying condition that further contributed to impaired immunity. We propose VÎ³9VÎ´2 T cells show a strong potential to serve as harbingers of possible adverse immune effects of n-BP therapy, particularly in those patients already having a compromised immune system as they may be most vulnerable to the development of conditions such as BAONJ.
15121646	A PET study of GENENOTIN occupancy in patients with schizophrenia treated with therapeutic doses of CHEMICALNOTIN. OBJECTIVE: CHEMICALIN is an atypical antipsychotic drug that shows a higher affinity for CHEMICALNOTIN GENEIN compared with GENEIN in vitro. The affinity of CHEMICALNOTIN for these receptors in vivo in patients was examined in a positron emission tomography (PET) study. METHOD: The authors conducted a PET study to evaluate GENEIN occupancy (using CHEMICALIN) and GENEIN occupancy (using CHEMICALIN) in brain regions of interest in 16 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder randomly assigned to receive 40, 80, 120, or 160 mg/day of CHEMICALNOTIN, which reflected the recommended dose range. PET scanning was done after 3 weeks of administration and at trough plasma levels, i.e., 12-16 hours after the last dose. RESULTS: The mean GENENOTIN receptor occupancy was significantly higher than the mean GENENOTIN occupancy (mean=76%, SD=15%, and mean=56%, SD=18%, respectively). The estimated plasma CHEMICALIN concentration associated with 50% maximal GENEIN receptor occupancy was almost four times lower than that for GENEIN occupancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data affirm that CHEMICALIN is similar to other novel antipsychotics in having greater GENEIN than GENEIN occupancy at therapeutic doses and suggest that the optimal effective dose of CHEMICALNOTIN is closer to 120 mg/day than to the lower doses suggested by previous PET studies. The relatively high GENEIN occupancy, even at trough plasma levels, suggests that CHEMICALIN is more similar to CHEMICALIN and olanzapine in receptor occupancy profile than to CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Since CHEMICALNOTIN plasma levels show significant (more than twofold) variation within a single dose cycle, studies that are aimed at peak plasma levels (6 hours after the last dose) and that examine extrastriatal regions are required to fully characterize the in vivo occupancy profile of CHEMICALNOTIN.
12566304	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN in human colon cancer cells. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including CHEMICALNOTIN are promising chemopreventive agents for colorectal cancer. CHEMICALIN and selective GENEIN inhibitors cause regression of colonic polyps in familial polyposis patients. CHEMICALNOTIN induces apoptotic cell death in cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In tumor cells, activation of GENENOTIN results in phosphorylation of several GENENOTIN effectors, including the proapoptotic protein GENENOTIN. Phosphorylation of CHEMICALNOTIN112 by GENENOTIN inactivates GENENOTIN and protects the tumor cell from apoptosis. CHEMICALIN metabolites and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs selectively inhibit GENEIN phosphorylation in human colon cancer cells. In this study we show that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) strongly induces phosphorylation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in HT29 colon cancer cells. GENEIN-stimulated phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN is blocked by pretreatment with CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN inhibitor. Similarly, pretreatment with CHEMICALIN blocks the ability of GENEIN to induce GENEIN and GENEIN phosphorylation, but also down-regulates total GENEIN but not GENEIN protein levels. The ability of CHEMICALIN to block GENEIN signaling by the GENEIN may account for at least part of its potent growth-inhibitory effects against cancer cells.
23590386	Fibrillar Morphology of Derivatives of Poly(3-alkylthiophene)s by Solvent Vapor Annealing: Effects of Conformational Transition and Conjugate Length. A fibrillar morphology was obtained, compared to the featherless pristine films, via solvent annealing the films of a series of derivatives of poly(3-alkylthiophene)s (P3ATs): poly(3-dodecylthiophene) (P3DDT), poly(3,3â´-didodecyl-quaterthiophene) (PQT12), and poly(2,5-bis(3-dodecylthiophen-2-yl)thieno[3,2-b]thiophene) (pBTTT12). Among the solvents used, including dichloromethane, chloroform, tetrahydrofuran, and carbon disulfide (CS2), CS2 was the best to induce fibril formation because its solubility parameter is closest to those of the P3AT derivatives. It was found that higher critical CS2 vapor pressures were needed to form crystal nuclei with increasing conjugation length and molecular weight of the P3AT derivatives; i.e., the critical vapor pressures for P3DDT 13.9k and PQT12 15.5k were 59.0% and 80.7%, respectively, and there were no nuclei of fibrils for pBTTT12 15.6k with the highest conjugation length, even at a CS2 vapor pressure of 98.3%. Meanwhile, at the highest vapor pressure, the fibril density decreased with increasing conjugation length and molecular weight of the P3AT derivatives. This is attributed to the rod-like conformation prevailing for polymers with larger conjugation length and higher molecular weight during solvent annealing, making the conformational transition toward coils more difficult and hindering diffusion of molecules. The results presented here are expected to be helpful for the design and processing of conjugated semiconductor polymers.
20573261	GENENOTIN antagonism diminishes existing airway inflammation and dysfunction via modulation of GENENOTIN. BACKGROUND: Airway remodeling and dysfunction are characteristic features of asthma thought to be caused by aberrant production of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) perturbation has previously been shown to modify acute inflammation and GENENOTIN production in a murine model of asthma. We examined the ability of GENENOTIN antagonists to therapeutically modify the effects of GENENOTIN production such as goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH), and GENENOTIN deposition in a sub-chronic model of asthma. In addition, effects on Th2 mediated lung dysfunction were also determined. METHODS: Mice were sensitized to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) followed by repeated airway challenge with GENENOTIN. After inflammation was established mice were dosed with the GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, or anti-GENENOTIN antibody for comparison. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured, lungs lavaged and tissues collected for analysis. RESULTS: Therapeutic GENENOTIN antagonism inhibited T cell infiltration in to the lung and decreased GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN dependent remodeling parameters such as GCH and lung GENENOTIN were reduced. Intervention with GENENOTIN antagonist also improved measures of central and peripheral airway dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that therapeutic GENENOTIN antagonism can significantly ameliorate allergen induced, GENENOTIN driven pathologies such as lung remodeling and airway dysfunction. The ability of GENENOTIN antagonists to affect these key manifestations of asthma suggests their potential as novel human therapeutics.
23561109	Research on the preparation of antioxidant peptides derived from egg white with assisting of high-intensity pulsed electric field. Egg white protein powder, one of the main egg products, was hydrolysed by Alcalase, Trypsin, and Pepsin respectively to prepare antioxidant peptides. All hydrolysates were assayed by determination of reducing power (RP) ability. Three kinds of hydrolysates were prepared under optimal enzymatic parameters that were obtained from the preliminary one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) and response surface methodology (RSM) experiments. The results showed that the Alcalase hydrolysates exerted the best RP ability. Thereafter, the Alcalase hydrolysates were sequentially fractionated by ultra filtration membranes in cut-off molecular weight (MW) of 30, 10, and 1kDa, and tested their antioxidant activities in terms of RP ability, DPPH radical scavenging ability, ABTS radical scavenging ability, and FRAP assay. Effects of high intensity pulsed electric field treatment were further investigated on antioxidant peptides to improve their activities. The results showed that Alcalase hydrolysates possessed the strongest antioxidant ability compared with the other two hydrolysates, particularly for the Fraction-3 with MW <1kDa. After PEF treatment, this fraction showed a significant improvement of RP ability within 5h (P<0.05).
17197042	Development and validation of a non-radioactive GENEIN assay for studying cytomegalovirus resistance to CHEMICALIN. Phenotypic characterisation of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN is a useful tool for testing for mutations in the GENENOTIN gene thought to render HCMV resistant to CHEMICALNOTIN. In this study, an in-house non-isotopic method for assessing polymerase enzymatic activity in the presence and absence of CHEMICALNOTIN was developed and its utility for GENENOTIN phenotyping evaluated. GENENOTIN activity was assessed by monitoring the incorporation of CHEMICALNOTIN-labelled nucleotides into the growing DNA chain and CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations inhibiting enzymatic activity by 50% were determined. GENENOTIN were synthesised in vitro by expression of GENENOTIN under the control of the GENENOTIN. Mutations of interest were introduced into the wild-type GENENOTIN gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Mutated GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN from HCMV reference strains were studied. The activity of GENEIN containing mutations known to confer resistance to CHEMICALIN (GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN) was inhibited by concentrations of CHEMICALIN eight to 14 times higher than those required to inhibit wild-type GENEIN. Our in-house non-radioactive phenotypic assay was sensitive and reproducible. It is also easy to perform and could provide a convenient method for characterising mutations conferring resistance to CHEMICALNOTIN in HCMV.
23291323	In vitro study of intestinal transport of CHEMICALNOTIN using the Caco-2 cell line. Water and food are the main sources of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure and therefore it is necessary to study intestinal absorption in order to make a correct evaluation of the risk/benefit associated with exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN. The present study characterizes intestinal transport of CHEMICALNOTIN, using the Caco-2 cell line as a model of the intestinal epithelium, and evaluates the coefficients of apparent permeability and intracellular accumulation in various conditions (pH, temperature, opening of cell junctions, presence of anions). The results indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN is an element with moderate absorption (<70%) in both directions (absorptive and secretory). Both in absorption (apical-basolateral) and in secretion (basolateral-apical) there is transport by the paracellular pathway, which may be considered predominant. Absorption and secretion of CHEMICALIN increase at acid pH levels, possibly because of its non-ionized state at these pHs and/or because of participation of a GENEIN or a GENEIN. The results also suggest transcellular participation of mechanisms involved in transport of CHEMICALNOTIN and of an active transport in the secretory direction. The present study extend the knowledge on the cellular transport of CHEMICALNOTIN and provide the basis for future studies aimed at identifying potential transporters involved in human CHEMICALNOTIN absorption.
23265892	Structure activity relationship studies of CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitors. An investigation is detailed of the structure activity relationships (SAR) of two CHEMICALNOTIN side chains of compound (-)-1a (CHEMICALIN), a potent, GENEIN-selective GENEIN inhibitor and clinical candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Specifically, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN substituted CHEMICALNOTIN analogs, (-)-1b and (-)-1c, are equipotent to compound (-)-1a. On the right hand side chain, linker size and terminal substituents of the pendant CHEMICALNOTIN group are also investigated.
12388748	Formation of Mallory body-like inclusions and cell death induced by deregulated expression of GENENOTIN. Mallory bodies (MBs) are cytoplasmic inclusions that contain GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN and are present in hepatocytes of individuals with CHEMICALNOTIN liver disease, CHEMICALNOTIN steatohepatitis, or benign or malignant hepatocellular neoplasia. Mice fed long term with CHEMICALNOTIN are an animal model of MB formation. However, the lack of a cellular model has impeded understanding of the molecular mechanism of this process. Culture of HepG2 cells with CHEMICALIN has now been shown to induce both the formation of intracellular aggregates containing GENEIN as well as an increase in the abundance of GENEIN mRNA. Overexpression of GENENOTIN in HepG2, HeLa, or COS-7 cells also induced the formation of intracellular aggregates that stained with antibodies to GENENOTIN and with CHEMICALNOTIN (characteristics of MBs formed in vivo), eventually leading to cell death. The MB-like aggregates were deposited around centrosomes and disrupted the microtubular array. Coexpression of GENENOTIN with GENENOTIN restored the normal fibrous pattern of GENENOTIN distribution and reduced the toxicity of GENENOTIN. In contrast, an CHEMICALIN-terminal deletion mutant of GENEIN promoted the formation of intracellular aggregates even in the absence of GENENOTIN overexpression. Deregulated expression of GENENOTIN, or an imbalance between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, may thus be an important determinant of MB formation, which compromises the function of centrosomes and the microtubule network and leads to cell death.
23580316	Anti-Ulcerative Colitis Activity of Compounds from Euphorbia granuleta Forssk. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the anti-ulcerative colitis (UC) activity of the total alcohol extracts of Euphorbia granuleta Forssk. (Euphorpiaceae), isolate and identify the active compounds that could be responsible for the activity, in addition to determination of the possible mechanism of action. Six compounds were isolated and identified from this plant: three phenolic compounds (kampferol, kampferol-3-glucoside and kampferol-3-galactoside) in addition to three steroidal compounds (1-ethoxypentacosane, heptacosan-1-ol and Î²-sitosterol). Three compounds (heptacosan-1-ol, Î²-sitosterol and kampferol-3-galactoside) were found to be responsible for the anti-UC activity of E. granuleta extract. The anti-UC activity of these compounds may be explained by reducing the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-Î±), in addition to reduction of colonic malondialdehyde (MDA) contents. No side effects were reported on liver and kidney functions. The active compounds reduced both serum TNF-Î± and mucosal MDA levels. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
12398910	CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced reduction in CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations: effects on GENENOTIN densities. Low levels of CHEMICALIN may reduce the density of the GENEIN (GENEIN) by either increasing trafficking or reducing synthesis; a "neuroadaptive response". To determine whether CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-induced reductions in GENEIN density could be related to such a mechanism, CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN was administered to rats, and brain CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN density were measured. As expected, both treatments led to CHEMICALNOTIN depletion 1, 7 and 14 days later. However, only CHEMICALIN reduced GENEIN density. This observation suggests that CHEMICALIN-induced reductions in GENEIN density do not represent neuroadaptive responses to decreased levels of brain CHEMICALNOTIN, but may occur in response to some other stimulus or to the neurotoxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23250811	CHEMICALIN improves TNBS-induced colitis in rats by inhibiting GENEIN expression via the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway. CHEMICALNOTIN is a widely used spice with anti-inflammatory and anticancer properties. It has been reported to have beneficial effects in experimental colitis. This study explored whether CHEMICALIN improves colonic inflammation in a rat colitis model through inhibition of the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway and GENEIN expression. After induction of colitis with CHEMICALNOTIN, rats were intragastrically administered with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN daily for one week. Rat intestinal mucosa was collected for evaluation of the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, and histological score. GENENOTIN activity was detected by immunohistochemistry, and mRNA and protein expression levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN in colonic mucosa were detected by RT-PCR and Western blot. Compared with the untreated colitis group, the CHEMICALIN-treated group showed significant decreases in the disease activity index, colonic mucosa damage index, histological score, GENEIN activity, and expressions of GENEIN mRNA, GENEIN mRNA, GENEIN protein, GENEIN GENEIN protein, and GENEIN GENEIN protein (p < 0.05). GENENOTIN mRNA expression did not differ between groups. Disease activity index decreased more rapidly in the CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group than in the CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN mRNA and proteins between CHEMICALIN-treated and CHEMICALIN-treated groups. CHEMICALNOTIN shows significant therapeutic effects on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced colitis that are comparable to CHEMICALNOTIN. The anti-inflammatory actions of CHEMICALIN on colitis may involve inhibition of the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway and of GENEIN expression.
16916952	GENENOTIN ligand precursors and GENENOTIN genes are functionally inactivated. The decapeptide sequence of CHEMICALNOTIN is conserved in all jawed vertebrate species studied to date. New data for cattle (Bos taurus) indicates a gene encoding GENEIN decapeptide possessing CHEMICALIN (codon: CHEMICALIN) rather than CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) at position three in the mature peptide. This substitution is unique. We confirmed the DNA sequence after cloning part of the GENENOTIN gene. GENENOTIN peptide was synthesized and pharmacologically characterized. It did not bind to mammalian GENENOTIN expressed in different types of cell nor did it exhibit agonist or antagonist properties on GENENOTIN expressed in COS-7 cells. Bovine primers facilitated cloning of GENENOTIN DNA. A premature stop codon (TGA) replaces the expected CHEMICALIN codon at position seven of GENEIN in sheep DNA. Thus, both species possess GENENOTIN genes encoding inactive peptides, as previously described for GENENOTIN. The updated GENEIN gene sequence revealed inactivation by frame shifts, premature stop codons, and CHEMICALIN changes specifying nonconservative replacement of CHEMICALIN residues, similar to inactivation of GENENOTIN. Spliced RNA transcripts from the disrupted receptor gene were not detected in bovine pituitary. In contrast, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes are intact, encoding well-conserved protein sequences. These findings, and previous descriptions of inactivation of the GENENOTIN and deletions of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in laboratory rodents, suggest the CHEMICALNOTIN system has been replaced by the GENENOTIN system or is redundant in certain mammals.
12761285	Biosynthetic regulation and intracellular transport of phosphatidylserine in mammalian cells. In mammalian cells, phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) is synthesized through the action of the endoplasmic reticulum enzymes, PtdSer synthase 1 and 2, and the decarboxylation of PtdSer accounts for the majority of phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) synthesis. PtdSer decarboxylation for PtdEtn formation occurs in the mitochondria. In addition, the transport of PtdSer from the endoplasmic reticulum to the mitochondria is probably a rate limiting step for PtdEtn synthesis through the decarboxylation pathway. Therefore, the regulation of PtdSer synthesis and its intracellular transport appear to be essential events for the maintenance of normal cellular PtdSer and PtdEtn levels. Here we describe the current understanding of the regulation of PtdSer biosynthesis and the transport of PtdSer from the ER to the mitochondria in mammalian cells.
15931605	Use of nitisinone in patients with alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene and deficiency of homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase, is characterized by ochronosis, arthritis, and daily excretion of gram quantities of homogentisic acid (HGA). Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P < .001). The average plasma tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P < .001). During the final week of the study, 5 patients adhered to a protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.
17418819	Functional and molecular characterization of multiple GENENOTIN isoforms in corneal epithelial cells. The dependence of regulatory volume decrease (RVD) activity on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) isoform expression was characterized in corneal epithelial cells (CEC). During exposure to a 50% hypotonic challenge, the RVD response was larger in SV40-immortalized human CEC (HCEC) than in SV40-immortalized rabbit CEC (RCEC). A GENEIN inhibitor-CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)-blocked RVD more in HCEC than RCEC. Under isotonic conditions, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) produced GENEIN activation and transient cell shrinkage. Both of these changes were greater in HCEC than in RCEC. Immunoblot analysis of HCEC, RCEC, primary human CEC (pHCEC), and primary bovine CEC (BCEC) plasma membrane enriched fractions revealed GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN isoform expression, whereas GENENOTIN was undetectable. During a hypotonic challenge, GENENOTIN membrane content increased more rapidly in HCEC than in RCEC. Such a challenge induced a larger increase and more transient GENENOTIN activation in HCEC than RCEC. On the other hand, HCEC and RCEC GENENOTIN phosphorylation reached peak activations at 2.5 and 15 min, respectively. Only in HCEC, pharmacological manipulation of GENENOTIN activity modified the hypotonicity-induced activation of GENENOTIN, whereas GENENOTIN phosphorylation was insensitive to such procedures in both cell lines. Larger increases in HCEC GENENOTIN membrane protein content correlated with their ability to undergo faster and more complete RVD. Furthermore, pharmacological activation of GENENOTIN increased GENENOTIN phosphorylation in HCEC but not in RCEC, presumably a reflection of low GENENOTIN membrane expression in RCEC. These findings suggest that GENENOTIN plays a role in (i) maintaining isotonic steady-state cell volume homeostasis, (ii) recovery of isotonic cell volume after a hypotonic challenge through RVD, and (iii) regulating hypotonicity-induced activation of the GENENOTIN signaling pathway required for cell proliferation.
23435358	Changes in morphometry and association between whole-body fatty acids and steroid hormone profiles in relation to bioaccumulation patterns in salmon larvae exposed to perfluorooctane sulfonic or perfluorooctane carboxylic acids. In the present study, we have used salmon embryos whose continuous exposure to waterborne PFOA or PFOS at 100 Î¼g/L started as freshly fertilized eggs, and lasted for a total of 52 days. PFOS and PFOA were dissolved in methanol (carrier vehicle) whose concentration never exceeded 0.01% of total tank volume. Samples were collected at day 21, 28, 35, 52, 49 and 56 after the start of the exposure. Note that days 49 and 56 represent end of exposure and 1 week after a recovery period, respectively. Tissue bioaccumulations were determined by HPLC/MS/MS, steroid hormones, fatty acids (FAs) and lipids were determined by GC-MS, while mRNA expression levels of genes were determined by qPCR in whole body homogenate. We observed that PFOS and PFOA showed a steady increase in whole body burden during the exposure period, with a slight decrease after the recovery period. Calculated somatic indexes showed that PFOA produced increases in heart-, thymus-, liver- and kidney somatic indexes (HSI, TSI, LSI and KSI). PFOA and PFOS exposure produced significant decreases in whole body dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), estrone and testosterone at sampling day 21 and a strong increase of cortisol and cholesterol at the end of recovery period (day 56). PFOA and PFOS effects differed with DHEA and estrone. While PFOS decreased DHEA levels, PFOA produced an increase at day 49, and while PFOS decreased estrone, PFOA produced a slight increase at day 56. We observed changes in FA composition that predominantly involved increases in FA methyl esters (FAMEs), mono- and poly-unsaturated FA (MUFA and PUFA) and a decrease in n-3/n-6 PUFA ratio by both PFOA and PFOS. Particularly, an increase in - pentadecenoic MUFA (15:1), two n-3 PUFAs Î±-linolenic acid [ALA: 18:3 n3] and eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA: 20:5 n-3] and n-6 PUFA: arachidonic acid [ARA: 20:4 n6], docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) by PFOA and PFOS were observed. These effects were associated with changes in mRNA expression of FA elongase (FAE), Î5-desaturase (FAD5) and Î6-desaturase (FAD6) genes. In summary, the changes in hormonal and FA profiles may represent cellular and/or physiological adaptation to continuous PFOS and PFOA exposure by increasing membrane fluidity, and/or overt developmental effects. The present findings provide some potential insights and basis for a better understanding on the possible mechanisms of PFCs toxicity in fish.
23609782	Drugs in Development for Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis. Drug development for multiple sclerosis (MS), as with any other neurological disease, faces numerous challenges, with many drugs failing at various stages of development. The disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) first introduced for MS are only moderately effective, but given the lack of competition, they have been widely accepted in clinical practice. Although safety and efficacy continue to be the two main metrics by which drugs will be judged, the newer agents in the market also face challenges of a more comparative nature-are they more efficacious than the currently available drugs on the market? Are they safer or better tolerated? Do they offer any practical advantages over current treatments? Fingolimod represented a milestone following its approval as an oral drug for MS in 2010, offering patients a far more convenient administration route. However, association with cardiovascular complications has led to a more cautious approach in its initial prescribing, now requiring cardiac monitoring for the first 6Â h as well as subsequent monitoring of blood pressure and for macular oedema. Natalizumab, amongst licensed drugs, represents the current benchmark for efficacy. The risk of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy during natalizumab treatment is now more quantifiable. Other monoclonal antibodies are in various phases of development. Marketing authorisation for alemtuzumab has been filed, and whilst trial data suggest that its efficacy outperforms both licensed drugs and others in development, there is a significant risk of secondary autoimmunity. Its once-yearly administration, however, seems particularly advantageous. Rituximab is unlikely to be developed further as its license will expire, but ocrelizumab, another monoclonal antibody directly targeting B cells, is currently in phase 2 development and looks promising. Daclizumab is also moderately efficacious but may struggle to establish itself given its monthly subcutaneous dosing. There are new oral drugs in development, and it is likely that BG-12 will be licensed this year. This has been licensed for psoriasis so there are good safety data in humans that may also hold true in MS; however, its three times daily dosage will probably impact on patient compliance. Laquinimod has lower efficacy than BG-12 but appears safe and could find a place as a first-line agent. Teriflunomide has just been licensed by the US FDA and may challenge the current injectable first-line therapies as it has a similar efficacy but the advantage of being taken orally. However, risk of teratogenicity may caution against its use in some women of child-bearing potential. This review will examine drugs that have been recently approved as well as those that are in late phase 2 or 3 development as treatment for relapsing MS, highlighting their mechanism of action as well as the clinical trial and safety data before discussing their potential for success in an increasingly florid and complex DMT armamentarium.
23288049	Toxicity of the flame-retardant BDE-49 on brain mitochondria and neuronal progenitor striatal cells enhanced by a PTEN-deficient background. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) represent an important group of flame retardants extensively used, tonnage of which in the environment has been steadily increasing over the past 25 years. PBDEs or metabolites can induce neurotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction (MD) through a variety of mechanisms. Recently, PBDEs with < 5 Br substitutions (i.e., 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether [BDE-47] and 2,2',4,5'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether [BDE-49]) have gained interest because of their high bioaccumulation. In particular, congeners such as BDE-49 arise as one of the most biologically active, with concentrations typically lower than those observed for BDE-47 in biological tissues; however, its potential to cause MD at biologically relevant concentrations is unknown. To this end, the effect of BDE-49 was studied in brain mitochondria and neuronal progenitor striatal cells (NPC). BDE-49 uncoupled mitochondria at concentrations < 0.1 nM, whereas at > 1 nM, it inhibited the electron transport at Complex V (mixed type inhibition; IC(50) = 6 nM) and Complex IV (noncompetitive inhibition; IC(50) = 40 nM). These concentrations are easily achieved in plasma concentrations considering that BDE-49 (this study, 400-fold) and other PBDEs accumulate 1-3 orders of magnitude in the cells, particularly in mitochondria and microsomes. Similar effects were observed in NPC and exacerbated with PTEN (negative modulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway) deficiency, background associated with autism-like behavior, schizophrenia, and epilepsy. PBDE-mediated MD per se or enhanced by a background that confers susceptibility to this exposure may have profound implications in the energy balance of brain.
3440035	Pharmacological properties of CHEMICALIN as a member of a new class of GENEIN antagonists. Derivatives of CHEMICALIN are a new class of non-peptide GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonists. The most potent compound, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN), has a great affinity for the pancreatic GENEIN and is a competitive, specific and potent GENEIN antagonist on the smooth muscles of the gall bladder and ileum of the guinea pig and on the GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN secretion of isolated pancreatic acini. In vivo CHEMICALIN antagonizes the contraction of the gall bladder of the guinea pig and of the dog provoked by i.v. GENEIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). It antagonizes the satiety effect of GENENOTIN in the rat and is protective against CHEMICALNOTIN-, CHEMICALNOTIN- and diet-induced pancreatitis. CHEMICALIN is therefore a useful pharmacological tool to study the functions of GENEIN. For its pharmacological properties, its relatively low toxicity and because it is active also after oral administration, CHEMICALNOTIN is a candidate for diagnostic or therapeutic use in man when an involvement of GENENOTIN is suspected.
23495205	Synthesis and Structure-Activity Relationship Studies of Derivatives of the Dual GENEIN-GENEIN Inhibitor CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN and its ortho-halogenated (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) derivatives are first-generation dual GENEIN and GENEIN inhibitors (DASIs). Structure-activity relationship studies were performed on these compounds, and various modifications were made to their structures involving relocation of the CHEMICALNOTIN atom, introduction of more CHEMICALNOTIN atoms, replacement of the CHEMICALNOTIN with another group, replacement of the CHEMICALNOTIN linker with a CHEMICALNOTIN linker, replacement of the CHEMICALNOTIN ring with other ring structures, and replacement of the CHEMICALNOTIN group with an CHEMICALNOTIN group. The most potent inâvitro DASI discovered is an CHEMICALIN derivative with IC50 values against GENEIN and GENEIN in a JEG-3 cell preparation of 0.2 and 2.5ânM, respectively. The parent CHEMICALIN of this compound inhibits GENEIN with an IC50 value of 0.028ânM in the same assay.
23438471	The circadian clock circuitry and the AHR signaling pathway in physiology and pathology. Life forms populating the Earth must face environmental challenges to assure individual and species survival. The strategies predisposed to maintain organismal homeostasis and grant selective advantage rely on anticipatory phenomena facing periodic modifications, and compensatory phenomena facing unpredictable changes. Biological processes bringing about these responses are respectively driven by the circadian timing system, a complex of biological oscillators entrained to the environmental light/dark cycle, and by regulatory and metabolic networks that precisely direct the body's adjustments to variations of external conditions and internal milieu. A critical role in organismal homeostatic functions is played by the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) complex, which senses environmental and endogenous compounds, influences metabolic responses controlling phase I/II gene expression, and modulates vital phenomena such as development, inflammation and adaptive immunity. A physiological cross-talk between circadian and AHR signaling pathways has been evidenced. The alteration of AHR signaling pathway deriving from genetic damage with polymorphisms or mutations, or produced by exogenous or endogenous AHR activation, and chronodisruption caused by mismatch between the body's internal clock and geophysical time/social schedules, are capable of triggering pathological mechanisms involved in metabolic, immune-related and neoplastic diseases. On the other hand, the molecular components of the circadian clock circuitry and AHR signaling pathway may represent useful tools for preventive interventions and valuable targets of therapeutic approaches.
23127600	Protective effect of cinnamon CHEMICALNOTIN against CHEMICALNOTIN-diabetic mice fed high-sugar, high-fat diet and its underlying mechanism. This study was designed to investigate the potential effects of 14days' intragastrically given of cinnamon CHEMICALNOTIN (CPS) in treating diabetic mice induced by intraperitoneal injection of CHEMICALNOTIN (150mgkg(-1)) and fed high-CHEMICALNOTIN, high-fat diet. The diabetic mice model was successfully established through determining on fasting blood-CHEMICALNOTIN (FBG) test. As revealed by GENENOTIN (GOD) and radioimmunoassay (RIA), both CHEMICALIN (DC, 0.6gkg(-1)d(-1)) and CPS (0.3, 0.6, 1.2gkg(-1)d(-1)) treatments significantly resulted in down-regulation of blood CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN levels in serum, while the levels of oxidative stress markers were markedly lowered through ELISA assay. Meanwhile, the pathological damage in islet with pancreatic beta cells was ameliorated by treatment of CPS at different doses, as shown in HE stain. At the same time, the treatments also caused notable reduction of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN expressions showing in Western blot analysis. These findings demonstrate that cinnamon CHEMICALIN can exert the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects through the mechanisms that may be associated with repairing pancreatic beta cells in diabetic mice and improving its anti-oxidative capacity, as well as attenuating cytotoxicity via inhibition of GENEIN, GENEIN activation.
8263811	Nonadrenergic CHEMICALNOTIN binding sites on human platelets. Human platelets are shown to possess at least two high-affinity, CHEMICALNOTIN-preferring binding sites that are pharmacologically distinct from GENENOTIN. These nonadrenergic sites were radiolabeled even in the presence of a 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN mask of GENENOTIN. Heterogeneity at the nonadrenergic sites was demonstrated by comparing CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) binding vs. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) binding. Nonadrenergic CHEMICALNOTIN-labeled sites were enriched in platelet plasma membranes, whereas the nonadrenergic sites labeled by CHEMICALNOTIN were codistributed between plasma and internal membranes (nonadrenergic CHEMICALNOTIN-labeled sites had Bmax = 62 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 20 fmol/mg in internal membranes vs. the CHEMICALNOTIN-labeled sites had Bmax = 141 fmol/mg in plasma membranes and 192 fmol/mg in internal membranes). Furthermore, competition binding studies in the presence of a 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN mask revealed major (approximately 75%) and minor (approximately 25%) binding components on plasma membranes for CHEMICALNOTIN. Affinities for the major nonadrenergic CHEMICALNOTIN binding site were highly comparable to GENEIN sites in the brain stem (rank order: CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN). However, the minor component of CHEMICALNOTIN binding was similar to a site reported in kidney, having low affinities for all compounds tested, except CHEMICALNOTIN. Finally, a third nonadrenergic internal membrane site, labeled by CHEMICALNOTIN, was consistent with a GENEIN site (rank order: CHEMICALIN > IDX >> CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN > CHEMICALIN). Thus, based on differential subcellular distributions and affinity constants, human platelets appear to possess GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN), plus a novel CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive site, as well as an GENENOTIN. These nonadrenoceptor binding sites may explain certain novel platelet aggregatory properties previously ascribed to CHEMICALIN and endogenous CHEMICALIN-displacing substance(s), and may serve as markers of GENEIN in humans.
23238103	Age dependent differences in the regulation of hippocampal CHEMICALNOTIN hormones and receptor genes: relations to motivation and cognition in male rats. CHEMICALNOTIN and estrogenic functions are age-dependently involved in the modulation of learning, memory and mood in female humans and animals. However, the investigation of estrogenic effects in males has been largely neglected. Therefore, we investigated the hippocampal gene expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in 8-week-old, 12-week-old and 24-week-old male rats. To control for possible interactions between the expression of the GENENOTIN genes and other learning-related GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), CHEMICALIN-binding GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) were also measured. Furthermore, the concentrations of the ligands CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were measured. The spatial training was conducted in a hole-board. The 8-week-old rats exhibited higher levels of general activity and exploration during the training and performed best with respect to spatial learning and memory, whereas no difference was found between the 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The trained 8-week-old rats exhibited increased gene expression of GENENOTIN compared with the untrained rats in this age group as well as the trained 12-week-old and 24-week-old rats. The concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, however, were generally higher in the 24-week-old rats than in the 8-week-old and 12-week-old rats. The GENENOTIN mRNA concentrations correlated positively with behavior that indicate general learning motivation. These results suggest a specific role of GENENOTIN in the age-related differences in motivation and subsequent success in the task. Thus, CHEMICALNOTIN and estrogenic functions may play a more prominent role in young male behavior and development than has been previously assumed.
2886642	Effects of CHEMICALIN, other GENEIN antagonists and CHEMICALNOTIN on gastric acid secretory states in rats and dogs. CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist, inhibited gastric acid secretion in pylorus-ligated rats (ED50 = 4.9 mg/kg intraduodenal; 3.4 mg/kg p.o.; and 0.21 mg/kg i.p.) and in total gastric fistula or Heidenhain pouch dogs stimulated by CHEMICALNOTIN (ED50 = 0.12 mg/kg p.o. and 0.08 mg/kg i.v.), CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or a meal (ED50 values ranged from 0.11-0.26 mg/kg p.o.). The nonspecific inhibition of gastric acid by CHEMICALNOTIN supports the existence of interdependence between GENENOTIN on the parietal cell surface. Antisecretory potency of CHEMICALNOTIN after intraduodenal administration in pylorus-ligated rats was 6.4 times greater than CHEMICALNOTIN, 1.8 times greater than CHEMICALNOTIN, equal to that of CHEMICALNOTIN and 8 times less than that of CHEMICALNOTIN. Oral antisecretory potency of CHEMICALNOTIN in gastric fistula dogs was 31 times greater than CHEMICALNOTIN, 3.7 times greater than CHEMICALNOTIN and equal to that of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Studies using equieffective antisecretory doses of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in dogs suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN has a short duration of antisecretory activity similar to that of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23216335	Platelet-derived microparticles in overweight/obese women with the polycystic ovary syndrome. A substantial proportion of women with the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are obese and obesity is considered as a prothrombotic state. Platelet-derived microparticles (PMPs) might be implicated in the activation of the coagulation cascade. We aimed to assess plasma PMPs in overweight/obese women with PCOS. We measured plasma PMPs and determined anthropometric, metabolic, hormonal and ultrasonographic features of PCOS in 67 overweight/obese women with PCOS (with body mass index [BMI] >25.0 kg/m(2)) and in 21 BMI-matched healthy women. Circulating androgens and markers of insulin resistance (IR) were higher in women with PCOS than in controls. Plasma PMPs were also higher in women with PCOS than in controls (p = 0.046). In women with PCOS, plasma PMPs correlated with the mean number of follicles in the ovaries (r = 0.343; p = 0.006). In controls, plasma PMPs did not correlate with any of the studied parameters. In conclusion, plasma PMPs are elevated in overweight/obese women with PCOS compared with BMI-matched controls. The cause of this increase is unclear but both IR and hyperandrogenemia might be implicated. More studies are required to elucidate the pathogenesis of the elevation of PMPs in PCOS and to assess its implications on the cardiovascular risk of these patients.
17475673	Underexpression of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in the spontaneously hypertensive rat kidney. This study examined the inward transport of CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN preferential substrate, in monolayers of immortalized renal proximal tubular epithelial (PTE) cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive (SHR) rats. The expression of GENENOTIN in WKY and SHR PTE cells and kidney cortices from WKY and SHR was also evaluated. CHEMICALNOTIN uptake was highly dependent on extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN. Replacement of CHEMICALNOTIN by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN abolished transport activity in SHR and WKY PTE cells. In the presence of the system L inhibitor BCH, CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALIN uptake in WKY and SHR PTE cells was inhibited by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, which is consistent with CHEMICALIN transport through GENEIN. The saturable component of CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent CHEMICALNOTIN transport under V(max) conditions in SHR PTE cells was one-half of that in WKY PTE cells, with similar K(m) values. Differences in magnitude of CHEMICALIN-dependent CHEMICALIN uptake through GENEIN between WKY and SHR PTE cells correlated positively with differences in GENEIN protein expression, this being more abundant in WKY PTE cells. Abundance of GENENOTIN transcript and protein in kidney cortices of SHR rats was also lower than that in normotensive WKY rats. In conclusion, immortalized SHR and WKY PTE cells take up CHEMICALIN mainly through a high-affinity GENEIN, with functional features of GENEIN transport. The activity and expression of the GENENOTIN transporter were considerably lower in the SHR cells.
11511086	The antipsychotic drugs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN block GENEIN, a GENEIN. The antipsychotic drugs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are known to prolong the QT interval on the electrocardiogram via a high affinity block of the GENEIN known as GENEIN (GENEIN; GENEIN). We wished to test whether these drugs also displayed high affinity for the related GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. The cDNA encoding GENENOTIN channel was cloned from a human brain library. Northern analysis confirmed that the channel was localized to brain relative to other tissues including heart, liver and lung. Within the brain, GENENOTIN was expressed in higher amounts in the frontal lobe and cerebellum relative to the temporal, parietal and occipital lobes. Transient expression of GENENOTIN in Chinese hamster ovary cells produced outwardly directed CHEMICALNOTIN currents that activated at approximately -50 mV and produced a large transient component at positive membrane potentials. Inward tail currents measured at -100 mV were blocked in a dose-dependent fashion by CHEMICALNOTIN resulting in an IC(50) value of 43 nM. Significant inhibition was observed at concentrations as low as 3 nM. Block of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN also displayed a positive voltage-dependence. CHEMICALIN blocked GENEIN channel currents with an IC(50) of 103 nM and significant inhibition was noted at concentrations of 10 nM and higher. We conclude that GENEIN can be blocked by certain antipsychotic drugs like CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Inhibition of GENENOTIN or related GENENOTIN in the brain may contribute to the efficacy/side effect profiles of some antipsychotic drugs.
1352051	Different neuroleptics show common dose and time dependent effects in quantitative field potential analysis in freely moving rats. Under the assumption that field potentials recorded from particular brain areas reflect the net balance of neurotransmitter activities, the dose- and time-dependent responses induced by intraperitoneal application of different neuroleptic drugs are quantified by spectral analysis of the electroencephalogram recorded from frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum and reticular formation. The actions of haloperidol, chlorpromazine, clozapine, prothipendyl and thioridazine in general were characterized by increases of the spectral power in the alpha 1 and beta range, at higher dosages also in the theta range. This observed pattern of changes is in line with the neuroleptic induced spectral changes reported in the literature for other animals and man. In the light of the already known effects of other psychoactive drugs on the frequency content of field potentials in the rat, it should now be possible to classify different drugs in terms of their clinical indication. With respect to the type of neurotransmitter control underlying the changes produced by various neuroleptics, it is quite obvious from the comparisons with the respective drug effects that dopamine-D1-receptor controlled transmission is not responsible for this action. On the basis of earlier findings a possible interaction between dopamine-D2 receptor or glutamatergic transmitter control is discussed.
23301860	Single-walled CHEMICALNOTIN nanotube surface control of complement recognition and activation. CHEMICALNOTIN nanotubes (CNTs) are receiving considerable attention in site-specific drug and nucleic acid delivery, photodynamic therapy, and photoacoustic molecular imaging. Despite these advances, nanotubes may activate the complement system (an integral part of innate immunity), which can induce clinically significant anaphylaxis. We demonstrate that single-walled CNTs coated with GENENOTIN activate the complement system through C1q-mediated classical and the alternative pathways. Surface coating with CHEMICALNOTIN-based amphiphiles, which confers solubility and prolongs circulation profiles of CNTs, activates the complement system differently, depending on the amphiphile structure. CNTs with linear CHEMICALIN amphiphiles trigger the GENEIN pathway of the complement through both L-ficolin and mannan-binding GENEIN recognition. The GENENOTIN pathway activation, however, did not trigger the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. An amphiphile with branched CHEMICALIN architecture also activated the GENEIN pathway but only through L-ficolin recognition. Importantly, this mode of activation neither generated anaphylatoxins nor induced triggering of the effector arm of the complement system. These observations provide a major step toward nanomaterial surface modification with polymers that have the properties to significantly improve innate immunocompatibility by limiting the formation of complement GENENOTIN.
17959709	Conformational variations of both GENEIN and inhibitors provide the structural basis for the physiological effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN has higher affinity to GENEIN (GENEIN) than CHEMICALIN and lower administered dosage for the treatment of erectile dysfunction. However, the molecular basis for these differences is puzzling because two drugs have similar chemical structures. Reported here is a crystal structure of the fully active and nonmutated GENEIN in complex with CHEMICALIN. The structure shows that the conformation of the H-loop in the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN complex is different from those of any known structures of the unliganded GENENOTIN and its complexes with the inhibitors. In addition, the molecular configuration of CHEMICALIN differs from that of CHEMICALIN when bound to GENEIN. It is noteworthy that the binding of CHEMICALIN causes loss of the divalent metal ions that have been observed in all the previously published GENEIN structures. The conformational variation of both GENENOTIN and the inhibitors provides structural insight into the different potencies of the drugs.
23478800	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN activation in breast cancer cells by a reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species-mediated mechanism and independently of GENEIN and GENEIN. The small GENENOTIN GENENOTIN has been widely implicated in mammary tumorigenesis and metastasis. Previous studies established that stimulation of GENENOTIN receptors in breast cancer cells activates GENENOTIN and enhances motility via the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. As the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathway has been shown to be functionally associated with GENENOTIN receptors, we asked if this pathway could mediate GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN activation in response to GENENOTIN ligands. Here we found that the anticancer agent CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor, reduced the activation of GENEIN and motility in response to the GENENOTIN ligand GENENOTIN in breast cancer cells. However, GENENOTIN activation was not affected by GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN RNA interference, suggesting that the effect of CHEMICALIN occurs through a GENEIN-independent mechanism. CHEMICALIN also failed to affect the activation of GENEIN by GENEIN. Subsequent analysis revealed that CHEMICALIN strongly activates GENEIN and the GENEIN effector GENEIN (GENEIN) in breast cancer cells and induces the formation of stress fibers. Interestingly, disruption of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN pathway prevented the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activation by GENENOTIN. Lastly, we found that GENEIN activation by CHEMICALIN is mediated by reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS). The ROS scavenger CHEMICALIN and the mitochondrial antioxidant Mito-TEMPO rescued the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activation. In conclusion, these results indicate that GENENOTIN-driven GENENOTIN activation in breast cancer cells proceeds independently of the GENENOTIN pathway. Moreover, they established that the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN activity involves the alteration of the balance between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN.
9890894	Common and specific determinants for GENENOTIN in the ectodomain of the GENENOTIN complex. The assembly and activation of oligomeric complexes of GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and heparan CHEMICALNOTIN transmit intracellular signals regulating growth and function of cells. An understanding of the structural relationships between the three subunits and their redundancy and specificity is essential for understanding the ubiquitous GENENOTIN signaling system in health and disease. Previously, we reported that a primary heparin or heparan CHEMICALIN binding site resides in a distinct sequence in GENEIN of the three modules of GENEIN. Here we report that in the absence of flanking sequences, isolated GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN supports the binding of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN in respective order of affinity. None of the three GENENOTIN detectably bind GENENOTIN splice variants of GENENOTIN in the absence of flanking sequences. GENENOTIN and the CHEMICALIN-terminus of GENEIN are dispensable for high-affinity binding of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. Alterations in highly conserved GENENOTIN in the heparin binding domain and substitution of individual sequence domains spanning the entire sequence of GENENOTIN with those from GENENOTIN obliterated GENENOTIN binding. Addition of a specific number of GENENOTIN sequences to the CHEMICALIN-terminus of GENEIN resulted in a gain in affinity for GENENOTIN. Several site-specific alterations in the CHEMICALIN-terminus of full-length GENEIN, an isoform that otherwise absolutely rejects GENENOTIN, resulted in gain of GENENOTIN binding. These results suggest that a complex of GENEIN and heparan CHEMICALIN is the base common active core of the GENENOTIN and that flanking structural domains modify GENENOTIN affinity and determine specificity.
15452358	Brain but not spinal GENEIN receptor is responsible for the anti-allodynic effect of an GENEIN subunit-selective antagonist CHEMICALIN in a rat chronic constriction injury model. In order to examine the site of action of an GENEIN subtype-selective GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, we investigated its analgesic effect in a rat model of neuropathic pain at various routes of administration. Mechanical allodynia was induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the sciatic nerve in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Subcutaneous treatment of the animals with CHEMICALNOTIN at 10 mg/kg significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia. Intracerebroventricular injection of CHEMICALNOTIN at 10, 30 and 100 nmol also inhibited the mechanical allodynia in a dose-dependent manner, the statistically significant effect being achieved at the highest dose tested (100 nmol) without producing any behavioral abnormalities. However, intrathecal injection of CHEMICALNOTIN at a dose of 300 nmol failed to inhibit CCI-induced allodynia. A receptor binding assay using rat forebrain and spinal cord membrane preparations demonstrated that CHEMICALIN bound to the brain GENEIN receptor with a greater extent compared to the spinal cord one. These findings suggest that the anti-allodynia effect of CHEMICALIN is ascribable to blockade of GENEIN receptors at the brain, but not at the spinal cord. In contrast, intrathecal injection of a non-selective GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN, significantly inhibited CCI-induced mechanical allodynia at a dose of 300 nmol, indicating the difference in the site of action between the non-selective CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist and the GENENOTIN-specific CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist.
16884688	Mutations within the human GLYT2 (SLC6A5) gene associated with hyperekplexia. Hereditary hyperekplexia is a neuromotor disorder characterized by exaggerated startle reflexes and muscle stiffness in the neonate. The disease has been associated with mutations in the glycine receptor subunit genes GLRA1 and GLRB. Here, we describe mutations within the neuronal glycine transporter 2 gene (GLYT2, or SLC6A5, ) of hyperekplexia patients, whose symptoms cannot be attributed to glycine receptor mutations. One of the GLYT2 mutations identified causes truncation of the transporter protein and a complete loss of transport function. Our results are consistent with GLYT2 being a disease gene in human hyperekplexia.
12504917	Pharmacological properties of the anti-Parkinson drug CHEMICALNOTIN; modification of endogenous brain CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN reversal, serotonergic and dopaminergic behaviours. CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALIN] is a potent irreversible GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor with selectivity for type B of the enzyme, which is being developed for treatment of Parkinson's disease. In this study we examined effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on CNS CHEMICALNOTIN levels, modification of behavioural response to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, and reversal of CHEMICALNOTIN syndrome. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced ptosis was reversed by CHEMICALIN at doses above 2 mg x kg(-1) i.p., which inhibit GENEIN as well as GENEIN, but not at GENEIN-selective doses. However, combination of CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg x kg(-1) i.p.) with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN (50 mg x kg(-1) i.p.), or CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg x kg(-1) p.o.) with CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg x kg(-1) p.o.), did not induce the behavioural hyperactivity syndrome which is seen following inhibition of both GENEIN and GENEIN by CHEMICALIN together with the CHEMICALIN precursors. Following oral administration, levels of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) were unaffected in hippocampus and striatum after single doses of CHEMICALNOTIN up to 2 mg x kg(-1). Following chronic oral administration (21 days, one dose daily), levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in hippocampus and striatum were unaffected by CHEMICALNOTIN at doses up to 1 mg x kg(-1). CHEMICALIN does not modify CNS CHEMICALNOTIN tissue levels or CHEMICALNOTIN-induced behavioural syndromes at doses which selectively inhibit GENEIN but not GENEIN.
16399380	Characterization of the GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN was initially recognized by bioinformatic analysis of human sequence databases, and orthologous sequences were subsequently discovered in mouse, rat, pig, Caenorhabditis elegans, Schistosoma mansoni, and Drosophila melanogaster. In humans and mice, two GENENOTIN genes have been recognized and their genetic structures and expression patterns identified. In both species, GENENOTIN mRNA is expressed in liver and heart as well as a range of other tissues. GENENOTIN is expressed predominantly in the testis, although moderate levels of expression are seen in other tissues. Extensive immunohistochemistry of rat and human tissue sections has demonstrated cellular and subcellular specificity in the expression of GENENOTIN. The crystal structure of recombinant GENENOTIN has been determined, and it adopts the canonical GENENOTIN. A CHEMICALNOTIN residue in place of the catalytic CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN residues found in other GENENOTIN was shown to form a mixed CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN. GENEIN have GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities and also catalyze the reduction of CHEMICALIN, an intermediate in the pathway of CHEMICALNOTIN biotransformation. Other diverse actions of GENENOTIN include modulation of GENENOTIN and interaction with GENENOTIN release inhibitory drugs. In addition, GENENOTIN has been linked to the age at onset of both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Several polymorphisms have been identified in the coding regions of the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genes. Our laboratory has expressed recombinant GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN proteins, as well as a number of polymorphic variants. The expression and purification of these proteins and determination of their enzymatic activity is described.
23395171	Tmem64 modulates calcium signaling during RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclast maturation and function primarily depend on receptor activator of NF-ÎºB ligand (RANKL)-mediated induction of nuclear factor of activated TÂ cells c1 (NFATc1), which is further activated via increased intracellular calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)) oscillation. However, the coordination mechanism that mediates Ca(2+) oscillation during osteoclastogenesis remains ill defined. Here, we identified transmembrane protein 64 (Tmem64) as a regulator of Ca(2+) oscillation during osteoclastogenesis. We found that Tmem64-deficient mice exhibit increased bone mass due in part to impaired osteoclast formation. Using inÂ vitro osteoclast culture systems, we show here that Tmem64 interacts with sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase 2 (SERCA2) and modulates its activity. Consequently, Tmem64 deficiency significantly diminishes RANKL-induced [Ca(2+)](i) oscillation, which results in reduced Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CaMK) IV and mitochondrial ROS, both of which contribute to achieving the CREB activity necessary for osteoclast formation. These data demonstrate that Tmem64 is a positive modulator of osteoclast differentiation via SERCA2-dependent Ca(2+) signaling.
17254025	Bimodal occurrence of GENENOTIN in myelin and cytosol of brain. The growing use of CHEMICALNOTIN as an indicator of neuronal viability has fostered interest in the biological function(s) of this unusual CHEMICALNOTIN derivative. In considering the various physiological roles that have been proposed for this relatively abundant molecule one is obliged to take into account its unusual metabolic compartmentalization, according to which synthesis and storage occur in the neuron and hydrolytic cleavage in the oligodendrocyte. The latter reaction, catalyzed by GENEIN (GENEIN), produces CHEMICALIN groups plus CHEMICALIN and has been proposed to occur in both soluble and membranous subfractions of white matter. Our study supports such bimodal occurrence and we now present immunoblot, proteomic, and biochemical evidence that the membrane-bound form of GENENOTIN is intrinsic to purified myelin membranes. This was supported by a novel TLC-based method for the assay of GENENOTIN. That observation, together with previous demonstrations of numerous lipid-synthesizing enzymes in myelin, suggests utilization of CHEMICALIN groups liberated by myelin-localized GENEIN for lipid synthesis within the myelin sheath. Such synthesis might be selective and could explain the deficit of myelin lipids in animals lacking GENENOTIN.
11906441	Chemoprevention for high-risk women: CHEMICALNOTIN and beyond. The demonstration by the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project (NSABP) that 5 years of CHEMICALNOTIN therapy is associated with an approximate 50% reduction in breast cancer incidence in high-risk women was a milestone in breast cancer prevention. Because CHEMICALNOTIN is associated with increased risk of side-effects such as hot flashes, menstrual abnormalities, uterine cancer, and thromboembolic phenomena, its use will not be advisable or acceptable for all high-risk women. Women over 50 years of age appear to be at highest risk for serious adverse events, such as uterine cancer and thromboembolic phenomena. Individuals in whom CHEMICALNOTIN-associated breast cancer risk reduction appears to outweigh risk of serious side-effects include women with prior in situ or GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-positive invasive cancer, atypical hyperplasia, and/or women ages 35-49 with a calculated Gail 5-year risk of > or =1.7%, hysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year Gail risk of > or =2.5%, and nonhysterectomized women aged 50 and older with a 5-year Gail risk of >5.0%. It is not yet clear whether CHEMICALIN can reduce breast cancer incidence in women with GENENOTIN and GENEIN mutations, although preliminary evidence favors benefit for at least those with a GENEIN mutation. CHEMICALIN is a selective GENEIN modulator with less uterine CHEMICALNOTIN agonist activity than CHEMICALNOTIN, and it is hoped that it will result in fewer uterine cancers but will be equally efficacious in reducing the risk of breast cancer. The NSABP is currently conducting a randomized study of CHEMICALNOTIN versus CHEMICALNOTIN in high-risk postmenopausal women. Approximately one third of invasive cancers are GENENOTIN negative. CHEMICALIN does not reduce the incidence of GENEIN-negative cancers, nor does it appear to be effective in preventing the appearance of one third of GENEIN-positive cancers. Priorities in prevention research are to develop (a) biomarkers to refine short-term risk assessments based on epidemiologic models, (b) biomarkers predictive of response to specific classes of preventive agents, (c) drugs with fewer side-effects and/or effective in GENENOTIN-negative or GENENOTIN-positive CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant precancerous disease, and (d) efficient clinical trial models to assess new agent efficacy. Breast intraepithelial neoplasia (IEN) may be sampled by minimally invasive techniques and is an attractive short-term risk biomarker. Molecular abnormalities observed in IEN may be used to select potential agents for testing/therapy, and modulation of these abnormalities may be used in phase I trials to select appropriate doses and in phase II trials to assess response. Breast density volume and certain serum markers such as GENENOTIN are also being studied as potential risk and response biomarkers. Reversal or prevention of advanced IEN as well as modulation of other risk biomarkers in randomized phase II and phase III trials is being evaluated as a means of more efficiently evaluating prevention drugs in the future. A number of agents are being developed that target molecular abnormalities in IEN, have fewer or different side effects than CHEMICALIN, and may be effective in GENEIN-negative or CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant disease.
10694244	Inhibition by CHEMICALNOTIN of the antigen-induced production of CHEMICALNOTIN in GENENOTIN-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells. 1. The effect of CHEMICALIN, an anti-diabetic drug with GENEIN-sensitizing action, on antigen-induced production of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) was examined in CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-specific GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-sensitized RBL-2H3 mast cells following stimulation by the antigen, CHEMICALNOTIN-conjugated GENENOTIN. Levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, C(4) and E(4) and CHEMICALNOTIN in the conditioned medium were enzyme-immunoassayed. 2. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited the antigen-induced production of CHEMICALNOTIN, C(4) and E(4) and the potency of the inhibition was comparable to that of CHEMICALIN, a specific inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN) and a clinically used anti-asthmatic drug. Neither CHEMICALNOTIN nor CHEMICALNOTIN affected antigen-induced production of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN release from membrane phospholipids and degranulation. 3. CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN production by the supernatant fraction of RBL-2H3 cell lysate with similar potency to CHEMICALIN, suggesting that CHEMICALIN inhibits LT production by direct inhibition of GENEIN activity. 4. Furthermore, it was shown that CHEMICALNOTIN as well as CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN production in CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils. 5. These findings suggest that CHEMICALIN inhibits antigen-induced LT production in the GENENOTIN-sensitized RBL-2H3 cells and CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated rat peritoneal neutrophils by direct inhibition of GENEIN activity.
15951260	[Protein profile and CHEMICALNOTIN in children of school age in Ivory Coast]. The purpose of this transverse prospective study was to determine blood nutritional, immunity and inflammatory proteins change in CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency in children of school-age (262 children, aged 7 to 15 years). Blood CHEMICALNOTIN has been determined by HPLC with UV detection. Proteins have been measured by radial immunodiffusion according to Mancini. Results showed that 96 children (36.6%) presented a CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency (CHEMICALNOTIN < 200 microg/L with a GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN molar ratio = 0.29 +/- 0.06) while 166 (63.3%) children presented normal blood concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN > or = 200 microg/L with a GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN molar ratio = 0.40 +/- 0.08). This study showed that the GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN are lower in children with CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency. On the other hand, an isolated increase of GENENOTIN has been observed in boys with CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency. The CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency observed in this survey is due to a micronutrients deficiency in the diet which is essentially based on glucides. The positive correlation between CHEMICALIN and GENEIN concentrations might be the result of the CHEMICALIN inductive effect during GENEIN synthesis. The isolated increasing of GENENOTIN in boys with CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency has been assigned to the ecosensitiveness of the unfavourable environment. We therefore concluded that, in Ivorian primary-school-aged children with CHEMICALNOTIN deficiency, nutritional, immunity and inflammatory proteins which are modified are respectively GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN.
15944809	CHEMICALNOTIN prevents torsade de pointes by reduction of transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of early afterdepolarizations in an intact heart model of LQT3. BACKGROUND: In long QT syndrome (LQTS), prolongation of the QT-interval is associated with sudden cardiac death resulting from potentially life-threatening polymorphic tachycardia of the torsade de pointes (TdP) type. Experimental as well as clinical reports support the hypothesis that GENEIN blockers such as CHEMICALIN may be an appropriate therapeutic approach in LQTS. We investigated the electrophysiologic mechanism by which verapamil suppresses TdP, in a recently developed intact heart model of LQT3. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 Langendorff-perfused rabbit hearts, CHEMICALIN (0.1 microM), an inhibitor of GENEIN inactivation, led to a marked increase in QT-interval and simultaneously recorded monophasic ventricular action potentials (MAPs) (p < 0.05) thereby mimicking LQT3. In bradycardic (AV-blocked) hearts, simultaneous recording of up to eight epi- and endocardial MAPs demonstrated a significant increase in total dispersion of repolarization (56%, p < 0.05) and reverse frequency-dependence. After lowering CHEMICALNOTIN concentration, CHEMICALNOTIN reproducibly led to early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and TdP in 6 of 8 (75%) hearts. Additional infusion of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.75 microM) suppressed EADs and consecutively TdP in all hearts. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly shortened endocardial but not epicardial MAPs which resulted in significant reduction of ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALNOTIN is highly effective in preventing TdP via shortening of endocardial MAPs, reduction of left ventricular transmural dispersion of repolarization and suppression of EADs in an intact heart model of LQT3. These data suggest a possible therapeutic role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of LQT3 patients.
17253779	Specificity of GENEIN: formation of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. Metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, leads to the formation of CHEMICALNOTIN, the visual chromophore, and CHEMICALIN, which is involved in the regulation of gene expression through the GENEIN. Enzymes and binding proteins involved in CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism are highly conserved across species. We previously described a novel mammalian enzyme that saturates the 13-14 double bond of CHEMICALNOTIN to produce CHEMICALNOTIN, which then follows the same metabolic fate as that of CHEMICALNOTIN. Specifically, CHEMICALIN is transiently oxidized to CHEMICALNOTIN before being oxidized further by GENEIN enzymes. Here, we report the identification of two putative GENENOTIN homologues in zebrafish, one of which, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), also had GENENOTIN activity, whereas GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) was inactive under similar conditions. Unlike GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENEIN had an altered bond specificity saturating either the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of CHEMICALIN to produce either CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN, respectively. GENEIN also saturated the 13-14 or 7-8 double bonds of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a second endogenous form of CHEMICALNOTIN in zebrafish. The dual enzymatic activity of GENENOTIN displays a newly acquired specificity for the 13-14 double bond retained in higher vertebrates and also the evolutionarily preserved activity of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Expression of GENENOTIN was restricted to the liver and intestine of hatchlings and adult zebrafish, whereas GENENOTIN was expressed in the same tissues but at earlier developmental stages. Exogenous CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, or CHEMICALIN led to the strong induction of the expression of the CHEMICALNOTIN-metabolizing enzyme, GENEIN, arguing for an active signaling function of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites in zebrafish. These findings point to a conserved function but altered specificity of GENENOTIN in vertebrates, leading to the generation of various CHEMICALNOTIN compounds, some of which could have signaling functions.
17510308	Estimation of CHEMICALNOTIN maintenance dose based on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN genotypes. BACKGROUND: GENEIN polymorphisms are associated with decreased CHEMICALIN clearance and lower maintenance dosage. Decreased expression of GENEIN resulting from the GENENOTIN substitution has also been implicated in lower CHEMICALIN dose requirements. We investigated the additional contribution of this polymorphism to the variance in CHEMICALNOTIN dose. METHODS: Sixty-five patients with stable anticoagulation were genotyped for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN with Tag-It allele-specific primer extension technology. Plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations and CHEMICALNOTIN maintenance dose were compared among patients on the basis of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN genotype. RESULTS: Eighty percent of GENEIN*1/*1 patients stabilized on <4.0 mg/day CHEMICALIN had at least 1 GENEIN -1639A allele. Mean CHEMICALNOTIN doses (SD) were 6.7 (3.3), 4.3 (2.2), and 2.7 (1.2) mg/day for patients with the GENENOTIN -1639GG, GA, and AA genotypes, respectively. Steady-state plasma concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN were lowest in patients with the GENENOTIN -1639AA genotype and demonstrated a positive association with the GENENOTIN -1639G allele copy number (trend P = 0.012). A model including GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genotypes, age, sex, and body weight accounted for 61% of the variance in CHEMICALNOTIN daily maintenance dose. CONCLUSIONS: The GENENOTIN -1639A allele accounts for low dosage requirements of most patients without a GENENOTIN variant. Higher plasma CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations corresponding to increased CHEMICALNOTIN maintenance dosages support a hypothesis for increased expression of the GENENOTIN -1639G allele. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN genotypes, age, sex, and body weight account for the majority of variance in CHEMICALNOTIN dose among our study population.
20517484	The role of CHEMICALNOTIN in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, affecting 1% to 2% of people older than 60 years. Treatment of PD consists of symptomatic therapies while neuroprotective strategies have remained elusive. CHEMICALIN is a novel, potent, and irreversible GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor which has been approved for treatment of PD. CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN more potently than selegiline and has the advantage of once-daily dosing. In several large, randomized, placebo-controlled trials, CHEMICALNOTIN has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy in early PD and as adjunctive therapy in advanced PD. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to have neuroprotective effects in in vitro and in vivo studies. The recently completed delayed-start ADAGIO (Attenuation of Disease Progression with Azilect Given Once-daily) trial suggests a potential disease-modifying effect for CHEMICALNOTIN 1 mg/day, though the clinical import of this finding has yet to be established.
10626836	CHEMICALIN modulates desensitization of the GENEIN subtype GENEIN in Xenopus oocytes. Analysis of splice variants and site-directed mutants of the GENEIN GENEIN expressed in Xenopus oocytes has shown that CHEMICALIN produces a large potentiation of the GENEIN splice variant and suggested that CHEMICALIN might inhibit rapid desensitization, which is characteristic of this receptor (Karkanias, N. and Papke, R., Subtype-specific effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN function. J. Neurophysiol., 81 (1999) 1506-1512). We now show that mutation of the 769R/ G desensitization site (Lomeli, H.M.J., Melcher, T., Hoger, T., Geiger, J.R., Kuner, T., Monyer, H., Higuchi, M.B.A. and Seeburg, P.H, Control of kinetic properties of GENEIN channels by nuclear RNA editing. Science, 9(266) (1994) 1709-1713) greatly attenuates the CHEMICALIN-induced potentiation of GENEIN. Additionally, experiments with the non-desensitizing site-directed mutant GENENOTIN(GENENOTIN) (Stern-Bach, Y., Russo, S., Neuman, M. and Rosenmund, C., A point mutation in the CHEMICALIN binding site blocks desensitization of GENEIN. Neuron, 21 (1998) 907-918) further confirms that CHEMICALIN enhances GENEIN responses by reducing desensitization, since lithium's effects are reversed in this mutant. Lithium's effects on GENEIN desensitization are distinct from the effects of CHEMICALIN on desensitization. Specifically, CHEMICALIN, which potentiates wild-type GENEIN, is ineffective on the non-desensitizing GENEIN(GENEIN) mutant, but has synergistic effects with CHEMICALIN on wild-type receptors.
11009561	Oral administration of CHEMICALNOTIN prevents endothelial dysfunction and vascular oxidative stress in the aortas of GENENOTIN-resistant rats. We have reported that a deficiency of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an active cofactor of GENEIN (GENEIN), contributes to the endothelial dysfunction through reduced GENEIN activity and increased CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) generation in the GENENOTIN-resistant state. To further confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the effects of dietary treatment with CHEMICALIN on endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation and vascular oxidative stress in the aortas of GENEIN-resistant rats. Oral supplementation of CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg. kg(-1). d(-1)) for 8 weeks significantly increased the CHEMICALNOTIN content in cardiovascular tissues of rats fed high levels of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN-fed rats). Impairment of endothelium-dependent arterial relaxation in the aortic strips of the CHEMICALNOTIN-fed rats was reversed with CHEMICALNOTIN treatment. The CHEMICALIN treatment was associated with a 2-fold increase in GENEIN activity as well as a 70% reduction in endothelial CHEMICALNOTIN production compared with those in CHEMICALNOTIN-fed rats. The CHEMICALIN treatment also partially improved the GENEIN sensitivity and blood pressure, as well as the serum CHEMICALNOTIN concentration, in the CHEMICALNOTIN-fed rats. Moreover, CHEMICALIN treatment of the CHEMICALIN-fed rats markedly reduced the lipid CHEMICALNOTIN content of both aortic and cardiac tissues and inhibited the activation of 2 redox-sensitive transcription factors, GENEIN and GENEIN, which were increased in CHEMICALIN-fed rats. The CHEMICALNOTIN treatment of control rats did not have any significant effects on these parameters. These results indicate that CHEMICALIN augmentation is essential for the restoration of GENEIN function and the reduction of vascular oxidative stress in GENENOTIN-resistant rats.
23543413	A Re-evaluation of the Role of GENENOTIN, the GENENOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-Drug Entry into Human Cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an anti-cancer drug used in a number of malignancies including testicular, ovarian, cervical, bladder, lung, head, and neck cancers. Its use is limited by the development of resistance, often rationalized via effects on cellular uptake. It has been claimed that GENEIN, the GENEIN, is the major entry pathway for CHEMICALIN and related drugs via a mechanism that mimics copper. This is an unexpected property of GENENOTIN, a highly selective GENENOTIN. We compared the uptake rates of copper with cDDP (and several analogs) into HEK293 cells over-expressing wild-type or mutant GENENOTIN, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (mefs) that do or do not express GENENOTIN, and human ovarian tumor cells, sensitive or resistant to CHEMICALNOTIN. We have also compared the effects of extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN, which causes regulatory endocytosis of GENENOTIN, to those of CHEMICALNOTIN. We confirm the correlation between higher GENEIN levels and higher CHEMICALIN-drug uptake in tumor cells sensitive to the drug. However, we show that GENEIN is not the major entry route of CHEMICALIN-drugs and that the CHEMICALNOTIN transporter is not internalized in response to extracellular drug. Our data suggest the major entry pathway for CHEMICALNOTIN-drugs is not saturable at relevant concentrations and not protein-mediated. Clinical trials have been initiated that depend upon regulating membrane levels of GENENOTIN. If reduced drug uptake is a major factor in resistance, GENENOTIN is unlikely to be a productive target in attempts to enhance efficacy, although the proteins involved in CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis may play a role.
25225185	Acute effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN systems: an in vivo electrophysiologic characterization. CHEMICALNOTIN, a compound sharing structural molecular characteristics with CHEMICALNOTIN, is currently under investigation for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Using electrophysiologic techniques, the present study assessed the in vivo action of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN subtypes GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN; GENEIN, and GENENOTIN. In addition, the effects on GENENOTIN autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and GENENOTIN in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were compared with those of CHEMICALNOTIN, an agent in wide clinical use. In the DRN, CHEMICALIN completely inhibited the firing of CHEMICALNOTIN neurons via GENEIN agonism and was more potent than CHEMICALIN (ED50 = 230 and 700 mug/kg, respectively). In the locus coeruleus, CHEMICALNOTIN reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential GENEIN receptor agonist CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on CHEMICALNOTIN neuronal firing (ED50 = 110 mug/kg), demonstrating GENENOTIN antagonistic action. CHEMICALNOTIN reversed the inhibitory effect of the CHEMICALNOTIN agonist CHEMICALIN on VTA DA neurons (ED50 = 61 mug/kg), whereas it was ineffective when administered alone, indicating partial agonistic action on GENEIN. Compared with CHEMICALNOTIN, which significantly inhibited the firing activity of VTA CHEMICALNOTIN neurons, CHEMICALIN displayed less efficacy at GENEIN. In the hippocampus, CHEMICALIN acted as a full agonist at GENEIN receptors on pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, it increased CHEMICALNOTIN release by terminal GENENOTIN but not GENENOTIN autoreceptor antagonism. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, CHEMICALIN displayed GENEIN antagonistic action. Taken together, these results provide insight into the in vivo action of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN targets relevant in the treatment of depression and schizophrenia.
23580257	Anti-asthmatic Effects of Baicalin in a Mouse Model of Allergic Asthma. The aim of the study was to investigate the anti-asthmatic effects of baicalin (BA) and the possible mechanisms. Asthma model was established by ovalbumin (OVA) intraperitoneal injection. A total of 60 mice were randomly assigned to six experimental groups: control, model, dexamethasone (2âmg/kg), and BA (10âmg/kg, 20âmg/kg, 40âmg/kg). Airway resistance (RI) and lung compliance (Cdyn) were measured, histological studies were evaluated by the hematoxylin and eosin staining, Th1/Th2, OVA-specific serum, and BALF IgE levels and Th17 cytokines were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and Th17 cells was evaluated by flow cytometry (FCM). Our study demonstrated that BA inhibited OVA-induced increases in RI and eosinophil count; interleukin (IL)-4, IL-17A levels, and Cdyn were recovered and increased IFN-Î³ level in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Histological studies demonstrated that BA substantially inhibited OVA-induced eosinophilia in lung tissue and airway tissue. FCM studies demonstrated that BA substantially inhibited Th17 cells. These findings suggest that BA may effectively ameliorate the progression of asthma and could be used as a therapy for patients with allergic asthma. Copyright Â© 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
22859660	Effects of CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN ligand, on the haemodynamics of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced renal failure in rats. The modulating effect of GENENOTIN ligand on haemodynamic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (PE), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) were evaluated in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced acute kidney injury in rats. The effect of PE on CHEMICALNOTIN-treated animals was a dose-dependent increase in mean arterial blood pressure (MAP). For GENEIN and GENEIN, MAP was also increased for the CHEMICALIN group but not in a dose-dependent fashion. On the medullary blood flow (MBF), while the lower doses of PE and GENENOTIN increased the perfusion unit on the CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group, the higher doses decreased the perfusion unit. The GENENOTIN increased the perfusion unit on this group but not in dose-dependent fashion. The effects of PE and GENENOTIN on the cortical blood flow (CBF) of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group is similar to that of MBF for the same group but not for GENENOTIN. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in all the groups was the decrease in MAP. CHEMICALNOTIN caused dose-dependent increase in MBF of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group. The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the CBF perfusion unit was that of the increase for the CHEMICALNOTIN-treated group. The study showed that CHEMICALIN did not attenuate increased blood pressure induced by PE, GENEIN and GENEIN but caused enhanced vasodilation by CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN.
23159529	Nanobody-GENENOTIN nanoparticles (NANAPs) for the delivery of a GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN to GENENOTIN overexpressing tumor cells. A novel, GENENOTIN-targeted nanomedicine has been developed in the current study. CHEMICALIN crosslinked GENEIN nanoparticles with a size of approximately 100nm were loaded with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN-L(x)-a CHEMICALNOTIN-bound CHEMICALNOTIN analogue-which couples the drug to CHEMICALIN residues of GENEIN and is released in a reductive environment. GENEIN nanoparticles were surface-coated with bifunctional CHEMICALIN 3500 (CHEMICALIN) and a nanobody-the single variable domain of an antibody-(Ega1) against the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). EGa1-CHEMICALNOTIN functionalized nanoparticles showed a 40-fold higher binding to GENENOTIN-positive CHEMICALNOTIN squamous head and neck cancer cells in comparison to PEGylated nanoparticles. CHEMICALNOTIN-L(x) loaded EGa1-CHEMICALNOTIN nanoparticles were internalized by GENENOTIN-mediated endocytosis and ultimately digested in lysosomes. The intracellular routing of EGa1 targeted nanoparticles leads to a successful release of the GENENOTIN inhibitor in the cell and inhibition of proliferation whereas the non-targeted formulations had no antiproliferative effects on CHEMICALNOTIN cells. The drug loaded targeted nanoparticles were as effective as the free drug in vitro. These results demonstrate that GENENOTIN inhibitor loaded nanoparticles are interesting nanomedicines for the treatment of GENENOTIN-positive cancers.
10950934	Chromosomal localization, gene structure, and expression pattern of GENENOTIN: comparison with GENENOTIN and implications for evolutionary origins. Endogenously produced asymmetrically methylated CHEMICALIN residues are competitive inhibitors of all three isoforms of GENEIN (GENEIN). The enzyme GENEIN (GENEIN) specifically hydrolyzes these asymmetrically methylated CHEMICALIN residues to citrulline and methylamines. Previously we have proposed that regulation of asymmetric CHEMICALIN concentration by GENEIN may provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of GENENOTIN activity in vivo. Recently we reported the cloning of GENENOTIN and identified a novel GENENOTIN isoform (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively). Here we report that the GENENOTIN gene maps to chromosome 1p22 and confirm that GENENOTIN maps to the MHC III region of chromosome 6p21.3. Extensive analysis of the distribution of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mRNA in 50 human tissues indicates differential expression of GENENOTIN isoforms in brain regions, in immune cells, and during development. GENENOTIN expression predominates in highly vascularized tissues that express the GENENOTIN isoform and in immune tissues that can express GENENOTIN. Whereas GENENOTIN is expressed at relatively high levels in all fetal tissues examined, GENENOTIN expression varies little between fetal and adult tissues. The chromosomal localization of the GENENOTIN is consistent with gene duplication, and consistent with this, comparison of the gene structures indicates that the intron/exon organization is highly conserved. Phylogenetic analysis of GENENOTIN sequences from diverse species suggests that GENENOTIN gene duplication occurred prior to the emergence of bony fish some 400 million years ago. Overall the data suggest that GENENOTIN may be the more ancient of the two genes.
23465612	Structure-based design of novel CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitors that do not engage the catalytic CHEMICALNOTIN. The structure-activity relationship of a series of CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitors is described. Application of structure-based design to screening hit 1 yielded sub-micromolar inhibitors. Replacement of the CHEMICALNOTIN of 1 was guided by X-ray crystallography, which allowed the replacement of a key water-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN bond. This work culminated in compounds such as 31, which possess good GENENOTIN potency, excellent permeability and a low GENENOTIN efflux ratio.
23334176	Antidepressant use and glycemic control. RATIONALE: Past research on the association of antidepressant medication use with glycemic control abnormalities has produced mixed results. OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of antidepressant use with glycemic control abnormalities and screen-positive diabetes in a representative population sample of US adults without a diagnosis of diabetes. METHODS: Using data from adult participants of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2005-2010), the association of antidepressant use with continuous measures of HbA1c, fasting blood sugar, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, insulin sensitivity and screen-positive diabetes according to HbA1c, fasting blood sugar and 2-h oral glucose tolerance test were assessed. RESULTS: Antidepressant use was not associated with increased levels of HbA1c, fasting blood sugar, 2-h oral glucose tolerance test, reduced insulin sensitivity or increased prevalence of screen-positive diabetes. Results were mostly consistent across sociodemographic groups and across different lengths of exposure, different classes of antidepressants and levels of body mass index. CONCLUSIONS: In this representative population sample, antidepressant use was not associated with an increased risk of abnormalities in glycemic control or undetected diabetes. Positive findings from past research may be attributable to detection bias, in that individuals prescribed antidepressants may be more likely to be tested and diagnosed with diabetes.
16303771	GENENOTIN acts as a GENENOTIN that triggers intracellular signal transduction and induces GENENOTIN gene expression. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a CHEMICALIN protease well known for generating GENEIN, has been demonstrated to induce GENEIN (GENENOTIN) gene expression and protein secretion in renal interstitial fibroblasts. However, exactly how GENENOTIN transduces its signal into the nucleus to control gene expression is unknown. This study investigated the mechanism by which GENENOTIN induces GENENOTIN gene expression. Both wild-type and non-enzymatic mutant GENENOTIN were found to induce GENENOTIN expression in rat kidney interstitial fibroblasts (NRK-49F), indicating that the actions of GENENOTIN are independent of its proteolytic activity. GENENOTIN bound to the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in NRK-49F cells, and this binding was competitively abrogated by the GENENOTIN antagonist, the receptor-associated protein. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PEA-13) lacking GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN failed to induce GENENOTIN expression. Furthermore, GENENOTIN induced rapid CHEMICALIN phosphorylation on the beta subunit of GENEIN, which was followed by the activation of GENEIN and its downstream GENEIN. Blockade of GENENOTIN activation by the GENENOTIN inhibitor abolished GENENOTIN induction by GENENOTIN in NRK-49F cells. Conversely, overexpression of GENENOTIN induced GENENOTIN phosphorylation and GENENOTIN expression. In mouse obstructed kidney, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN were concomitantly induced in the renal interstitium. Collectively, these results suggest that besides its classical proteolytic activity, GENENOTIN acts as a GENENOTIN that binds to the cell membrane receptor GENEIN, induces its CHEMICALIN phosphorylation, and triggers intracellular signal transduction, thereby inducing specific gene expression in renal interstitial fibroblasts.
23628509	CHEMICALNOTIN - Chemistry and biological activity. Despite CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) having been detected in the environment, the ability of these compounds to induce cellular and tissue responses remains poorly characterized. In this review, we look at the chemistry and biological activity of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) as potential chemicals of concern in the process of risk assessment. The first part of the review deals with the environmental occurrence and chemistry of CHEMICALNOTIN, focusing on available methods of CHEMICALNOTIN chemical synthesis. The most interesting structural feature of the CHEMICALNOTIN is the presence of a pseudo fjord-region constructed by the CHEMICALNOTIN ring. This compound can be treated either as a structurally similar one to CHEMICALNOTIN, or as a CHEMICALNOTIN skeleton with an electrodonating CHEMICALNOTIN substituent in the bay-region of the molecule. The second thread, providing available data on the adverse effects of CHEMICALNOTIN compounds on cells and tissues of living organisms, mainly fish, improves our understanding of these possible environmental hazards. The data show that CHEMICALIN is less potent at inducing GENEIN gene expression in rainbow trout than CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a well-known Ah-receptor agonist. Interestingly, the CHEMICALIN dependent up-regulation of GENEIN mRNA is positively correlated with the incidences of clastogenic changes in rainbow trout erythrocytes. CHEMICALIN has, comparably to CHEMICALIN, a potential to repress expression of GENEIN, in the head kidney of rainbow trout. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN responsive genes in fish liver, GENEIN and GENEIN, are not induced by CHEMICALIN, suggesting that the compound has no endocrine disrupting potential. However, some CHEMICALNOTIN show mutagenic activity when investigated in the Ames test, and exhibit genotoxic properties in in vitro micronucleus assay. The above characteristics suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN are chemicals of concern for which potential pathways of exposure should be further identified.
10933803	Zymogen factor IX potentiates factor IXa-catalyzed factor X activation. Intrinsic factor X activation is accelerated >10(7)-fold by assembly of the entire complex on the activated platelet surface. We have now observed that increasing the concentration of zymogen factor IX to physiologic levels ( approximately 100 nM) potentiates factor IXa-catalyzed activation of factor X on both activated platelets and on negatively charged phospholipid vesicles. In the presence and absence of factor VIIIa, factor IX (100 nM) lowered the K(d,appFIXa) approximately 4-fold on platelets and 2-10-fold on lipid vesicles. Treatment of two factor IX preparations with active-site inhibitors did not affect these observations. Autoradiographs of PAGE-separated reactions containing either (125)I-labeled factor IX or (125)I-labeled factor X showed that the increased factor X activation was not due to factor Xa-mediated feedback activation of factor IX and that there was increased cleavage of factor X heavy chain in the presence of factor IX in comparison with control reactions but only in the presence of both the enzyme and the surface. Since plasma concentrations of prothrombin, factor VII, protein C, or protein S did not by themselves potentiate factor Xa generation and did not interfere with the potentiation of the reaction of factor IX, the effect is specific for factor IX and is not attributable to the Gla domain of all vitamin K-dependent proteins. These observations indicate that under physiologic conditions, plasma levels of the zymogen factor IX specifically increase the affinity of factor IXa for the intrinsic factor X activation complex.
9607108	Biosynthesis, assembly and secretion of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is a large complex glycoprotein that is deficient in hemophilia A. It has a domain organization consisting of GENENOTIN where the GENENOTIN is a heavily glycosylated region that is dispensable for procoagulant activity. GENENOTIN expression is 10-to 20-fold lower than the homologous GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN expression is limited due to a low level of steady-state messenger RNA in the cytoplasm and inefficient transport of the primary translation product from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus. Within the secretory pathway, GENENOTIN is processed to a heterodimer of the heavy chain (GENENOTIN) in a metal ion association with the light chain (GENENOTIN). Upon secretion from the cell, GENENOTIN binds the GENENOTIN and stabilizes the factor, preventing degradation. Protein folding within the mammalian secretory pathway is facilitated by GENENOTIN. Within the endoplasmic reticulum, GENENOTIN exhibits stable interaction with protein chaperones identified as the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is a peptide-dependent GENENOTIN that interacts with exposed hydrophobic surfaces on unfolded proteins or unassembled protein subunits. A potential GENENOTIN within GENENOTIN has been identified. Mutation of a single CHEMICALIN residue in the potential GENEIN increased the secretion efficiency of GENENOTIN by threefold. Interestingly, the proposed GENENOTIN is adjacent to a GENENOTIN within the GENENOTIN that is required for interaction between the GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN. We propose that CHEMICALIN binds the GENEIN in the GENEIN and provides the essential requirement for a stable interaction between the heavy and light chains. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are transmembrane and lumenal proteins, respectively, localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, which associate transiently with many soluble and membrane glycoproteins during folding and subunit assembly. The GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN interaction with GENENOTIN occurs primarily through CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal linked oligosaccharides within the heavily glycosylated GENENOTIN and this interaction appears to be required for GENENOTIN secretion. The findings suggest that GENENOTIN cycles through interactions with GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Although the interaction with GENENOTIN does not appear to be required for GENENOTIN secretion, data suggest that the GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN interaction is required for secretion. The observations suggest a unique requirement for CHEMICALNOTIN processing and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN interaction that may limit the productive secretion of GENENOTIN and have implications for approaches towards somatic cell gene therapy for hemophilia A.
23260350	Identification of CHEMICALIN central cores for the inhibition of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (LT's) are known to play a physiological role in inflammatory immune response. GENEIN (GENEIN) is a cystolic enzyme that stereospecifically catalyzes the transformation of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN is a known pro-inflammatory mediator. This paper describes the identification and synthesis of substituted CHEMICALIN as GENEIN inhibitors. The CHEMICALNOTIN series demonstrated reduced mouse and human whole blood CHEMICALNOTIN levels in vitro and led to the identification one analog for advanced profiling. CHEMICALIN 28 showed dose responsive target engagement and provides a useful tool to explore a GENEIN inhibitor for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, such as asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
12112047	CHEMICALNOTIN markedly protects the neonatal brain against hypoxic-ischemic injury. Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in the perinatal period is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Presently, there are no proven effective therapies with which to safeguard the human neonatal brain against this type of injury. CHEMICALNOTIN, a semisynthetic CHEMICALNOTIN, has been shown to be neuroprotective in certain adult ischemic injury/stroke and neurodegenerative disease models. However, minocycline's neuroprotective effects have not been assessed after insults to the neonatal brain. We now report that CHEMICALNOTIN administered either immediately before or immediately after a hypoxic-ischemic insult substantially blocks tissue damage in a rodent model of neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury. CHEMICALIN treatment prevents the formation of activated GENEIN, a known effector of apoptosis, as well as the appearance of a GENEIN cleaved substrate, a marker of excitotoxic/necrotic cell death. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a systemic treatment that can be administered after a hypoxic-ischemic insult, which provides robust, nearly complete neuroprotection to the developing brain. Our data suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN or a related neuroprotective CHEMICALNOTIN may be a candidate to consider in human clinical trials to protect the developing brain against hypoxic-ischemic-induced damage.
16206183	In vivo comparison of the reinforcing and GENENOTIN effects of local anesthetics in rhesus monkeys. Dopaminergic mechanisms are thought to play a central role in the reinforcing effects of CHEMICALNOTIN. Similar to CHEMICALIN, other local anesthetics bind to the GENEIN (GENEIN) and inhibit CHEMICALNOTIN uptake in rodent and monkey brain. Additionally, local anesthetics are self-administered in rhesus monkeys, indicative of abuse liability. The present study examined the reinforcing and GENEIN effects of the local anesthetics CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN using in vivo techniques. Monkeys were trained to respond under a second-order schedule for i.v. CHEMICALNOTIN administration (0.10 or 0.30 mg/kg/infusion). When responding was stable, CHEMICALNOTIN (0.030-1.7 mg/kg/ infusion) or CHEMICALNOTIN (0.10-10 mg/kg/ infusion) was substituted for the CHEMICALNOTIN training dose. CHEMICALNOTIN administration produced higher response rates compared with that of CHEMICALNOTIN, and was a more potent reinforcer. Drug effects on behavior were related to GENENOTIN occupancy in monkey striatum during neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET). GENEIN occupancy was determined by displacement of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). GENEIN occupancy was between 66 and 82% and <10-41% for doses of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Finally, in vivo microdialysis in awake subjects determined drug-induced changes in extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN in the caudate nucleus. There was close correspondence between peak increases in CHEMICALIN and GENEIN occupancy. Overall, reinforcing effects were consistent with GENENOTIN effects determined with in vivo techniques. The results further support a role for the GENENOTIN in the abuse liability of local anesthetics.
17652426	Bone growth retardation in mouse embryos expressing human collagenase 1. Cellular growth and differentiation are readouts of multiple signaling pathways from the intercellular and/or extracellular milieu. The extracellular matrix through the activation of cellular receptors transmits these signals. Therefore, extracellular matrix proteolysis could affect cell fate in a variety of biological events. However, the biological consequence of inadequate extracellular matrix degradation in vivo is not clear. We developed a mouse model expressing human collagenase (matrix metalloproteinase-1, MMP-1) under the control of Col2a1 promoter. The mice showed significant growth retardation during embryogenesis and a loss of the demarcation of zonal structure and columnar array of the cartilage. Immunological examination revealed increased degradation of type II collagen and upregulation of fibronectin and alpha(5)-integrin subunit in the transgenic cartilage. The resting zone and proliferating zone of the growth plate cartilage exhibited a simultaneous increase in bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-incorporated proliferating cells and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated X-dUTP nick-end labeling-positive apoptotic cells, respectively. Chondrocyte differentiation was not disturbed in the transgenic mice as evidenced by normal expression of the Ihh and type X collagen expression. These data demonstrate that type II collagen proteolysis is an important determinant for the skeletal outgrowth through modulation of chondrocyte survival and cartilagenous growth.
19203467	Neurochemical effects of the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN on brain CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN: A comparison with CHEMICALNOTIN. PURPOSE: To compare CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an antidepressant drug with anxiolytic properties which inhibits GENEIN (GENEIN) but also elevates rat brain levels of the CHEMICALNOTIN ?-CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an anticonvulsant which elevates brain CHEMICALNOTIN by inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN), with regard to their actions on brain levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and on activities of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). METHODS: Male rats were administered CHEMICALIN (10 mg/kg) or CHEMICALIN (1,000 mg/kg) i.p., and the rats were euthanized 4 hours later and the brains removed for analysis of levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (by electron capture gas chromatography after derivatization) and activities of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN (radiochemical assays). RESULTS: Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN and elevated CHEMICALNOTIN levels. Only CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN and GENEIN and elevated CHEMICALNOTIN levels. The effects of CHEMICALIN on both CHEMICALNOTIN and their GENEIN were blocked by pre-treatment with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN. This pretreament had no effect on the inhibition of GENEIN or the elevation of brain CHEMICALNOTIN levels produced by CHEMICALIN. CONCLUSIONS: At the doses studied, CHEMICALNOTIN was as effective as CHEMICALNOTIN at elevating brain CHEMICALNOTIN levels, but, unlike CHEMICALIN, also inhibited GENEIN and GENEIN (and increased brain CHEMICALNOTIN levels). Pretreatment of rats with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN prevented the increase in brain CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels with CHEMICALNOTIN, but did not block the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN. These observations with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN support the hypothesis that an active metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN produced by the actions of GENENOTIN on this drug plays a major role in its CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-elevating actions.
1705633	Clinical pharmacology of CHEMICALIN, a novel, CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitor. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a potent, CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitor, mimics the transition state of the GENEIN substrate, GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN has been shown to produce dose-related suppression of plasma GENEIN activity (PRA) and GENEIN when administered intravenously. Doses of CHEMICALNOTIN of less than 0.1 mg/kg induced little hemodynamic response in normotensive and hypertensive volunteers despite marked suppression of PRA. However, at doses of 0.3 and 1.2 mg/kg, CHEMICALNOTIN produced significant, dose-related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, and the BP response was enhanced by pretreatment with CHEMICALNOTIN. The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on PRA and BP are prolonged despite its relatively short elimination phase plasma half-life (1.6 h). Persistent pharmacologic activity without evidence of tachyphylaxis was demonstrated during 1 week of treatment in hypertensive patients. The observed dissociation between suppression of PRA and BP response and the recruitment of dose-related BP decrements, despite complete suppression of PRA, are unexplained phenomena. The results of clinical trials with CHEMICALIN are encouraging, and suggest that GENEIN inhibitors may be safe, useful therapeutic agents in the management of hypertension.
11861820	CHEMICALNOTIN decreases plasmalemmal and vesicular CHEMICALNOTIN transport: mechanisms and implications for neurotoxicity. Administration of a high-dose regimen of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) rapidly and profoundly decreases plasmalemmal and vesicular CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) transport in the striatum, as assessed in synaptosomes and purified vesicles, respectively. To determine whether these responses were common to other CHEMICALIN of abuse, effects of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on the plasmalemmal GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) were assessed. Similar to effects of CHEMICALNOTIN reported previously, multiple high-dose CHEMICALNOTIN administrations rapidly (within 1 h) decreased plasmalemmal CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, as assessed ex vivo in synaptosomes prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple CHEMICALNOTIN injections, this deficit was reversed completely 24 h after drug treatment. Also in contrast to effects of multiple CHEMICALIN injections, 1) CHEMICALIN caused little or no decrease in binding of the GENEIN ligand CHEMICALIN, and 2) neither prevention of hyperthermia nor prior depletion of CHEMICALIN prevented the CHEMICALIN-induced reduction in plasmalemmal CHEMICALIN transport. However, a role for phosphorylation was suggested because pretreatment with GENENOTIN inhibitors attenuated the deficit caused by CHEMICALNOTIN in an in vitro model system. In addition to affecting GENEIN function, CHEMICALIN rapidly decreased vesicular CHEMICALIN transport as assessed in striatal vesicles prepared from treated rats. Unlike effects of multiple CHEMICALNOTIN injections reported previously, this decrease partially recovered by 24 h after drug treatment. Taken together, these results reveal several differences between effects of CHEMICALIN and previously reported CHEMICALIN on GENEIN and GENEIN; differences that may underlie the dissimilar neurotoxic profile of these agents.
23458730	Concentration-dependent inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN on the metabolism of CHEMICALIN, a dual probe of GENEIN and GENEIN, in rats. CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to possess many pharmacological effects, including antiviral, antioxidant, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory properties. In the current study, we reveal the inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN on the metabolism of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a dual probe substrate of GENEIN and GENEIN, in rats. Lineweaver-Burk plots demonstrated that CHEMICALIN inhibited the activities of GENEIN and GENEIN in a non-competitive manner in rat liver microsomes (RLMs). Concomitant administration of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.90g/kg, i.v.) and CHEMICALNOTIN (10mg/kg, i.v.) increased the maximum drug concentration (Cmax) (37%) and the area under concentration-time curve (AUC) (42%) and decreased the clearance (CL) (27%) of CHEMICALNOTIN in a randomised, crossover study in rats (P<0.01). The change in the AUC of CHEMICALNOTIN was significantly correlated with the Cmax and AUC of CHEMICALNOTIN (P<0.05). The inhibitory effects of multiple doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (0.90g/kg, i.v., 12days) on the metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN were similar to those observed following a single dose in rats. The activity of GENEIN in excised liver samples from rats following multiple CHEMICALIN treatment was significantly decreased compared to that of the control group (P<0.05), whereas multiple doses of CHEMICALIN had no obvious effect on the activity of GENEIN. Taken together, these data demonstrate that CHEMICALIN inhibits the metabolism of CHEMICALIN in a concentration-dependent manner in rats, possibly through inhibiting hepatic GENEIN and GENEIN activities.
23206862	Identification of a novel CHEMICALIN derivative as a highly potent GENEIN antagonist with an anti-obesity profile. Optimization of HTS hit 1 for GENENOTIN binding affinity, GENENOTIN inhibition, solubility and metabolic stability led to the identification of some orally available CHEMICALNOTIN-linker derivatives for in vivo study. Among them, derivative 4i inhibited food intake induced by the GENENOTIN selective agonist, and chronic oral administration of 4i in DIO mice caused a dose-dependent reduction of body weight gain.
1975995	CHEMICALNOTIN reduces autonomic hypersensitivity and length of seizures induced by electroconvulsive therapy. We evaluated the clinical effectiveness of CHEMICALIN, an ultra-short-acting GENEIN blocking drug, to control the sinus tachycardia and increase in arterial blood pressures induced by electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Each of 20 patients, ASA physical status I-III, participated in a double-blind, randomized study, involving four match-pair trials (placebo versus CHEMICALNOTIN) during ECT. Each patient acted as his or her own control (total number of ECT procedures, 160). We administered a 4-min infusion of either placebo or CHEMICALNOTIN at the rate of 500 micrograms.kg-1.min-1. We then induced anesthesia with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. After administration of electrical stimulation for ECT, the rate of infusion decreased to 300 micrograms.kg-1.min-1 for three additional minutes and was then discontinued. Statistically significant reductions in mean heart rate from minute 2 until minute 15 and in maximum heart rate (the mean of each patient's maximum heart rate after seizure changed from 152 +/- 23 to 115 +/- 24 beats/min) occurred in patients given CHEMICALNOTIN. During and immediately after infusion, arterial blood pressure also decreased. Finally, the length of seizures decreased, as manifested clinically from 48 +/- 18 to 39 +/- 14 s and on electroencephalogram from 86 +/- 41 to 67 +/- 28 s. We conclude that CHEMICALNOTIN effectively controls the hyperdynamic response to ECT and reduces the length of seizures. The significance of the latter to the overall effectiveness of ECT is not known.
23406315	A genetically encoded and gate for cell-targeted metabolic labeling of proteins. We describe a genetic AND gate for cell-targeted metabolic labeling and proteomic analysis in complex cellular systems. The centerpiece of the AND gate is a bisected GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) that charges the CHEMICALNOTIN surrogate CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) to tRNA(CHEMICALNOTIN). Cellular protein labeling occurs only upon activation of two different promoters that drive expression of the CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-terminal fragments of the bisected GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN-labeled proteins can be tagged with fluorescent dyes or affinity reagents via either CHEMICALNOTIN-catalyzed or strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition. Protein labeling is apparent within 5 min after addition of CHEMICALNOTIN to bacterial cells in which the AND gate has been activated. This method allows spatial and temporal control of proteomic labeling and identification of proteins made in specific cellular subpopulations. The approach is demonstrated by selective labeling of proteins in bacterial cells immobilized in the center of a laminar-flow microfluidic channel, where they are exposed to overlapping, opposed gradients of inducers of the CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-terminal GENEIN fragments. The observed labeling profile is predicted accurately from the strengths of the individual input signals.
16973691	Relative myotoxic and haemodynamic effects of the beta-agonists CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN measured in conscious unrestrained rats. The GENEIN (GENEIN) agonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN have similar beneficial effects in animal models of heart failure. However, large doses of CHEMICALNOTIN can induce cardiomyocyte death, and it is not known which of these agents has the most favourable therapeutic profile. We have investigated the cardiotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN alongside that of CHEMICALNOTIN, and compared their haemodynamic effects. Wistar rats (n = 6 per group) were subcutaneously injected with each beta-agonist (0.003-3 mmol kg(-1)) or saline, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis was detected by GENENOTIN immunohistochemistry. In a separate experiment, rats (n = 4) were given equivalent doses to those used in the myotoxicity studies, in a randomized cross-over design, and their blood pressure recorded via radiotelemetry. Injection of 0.3 mmol kg(-1) CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, induced significant cardiomyocyte apoptosis (0.4 +/- 0.05%; P < 0.05). At 3 mmol kg(-1), all agonists induced apoptosis (CHEMICALNOTIN, 1.1 +/- 0.1%; CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.9 +/- 0.8%; and CHEMICALNOTIN, 0.4 +/- 0.07%; P < 0.05). GENEIN antagonism (10 mg kg(-1) CHEMICALIN) prevented 92% (P < 0.05) of apoptosis induced by all three agonists, but CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis could also be prevented by 96% (P < 0.05) by GENENOTIN antagonism (10 mg kg(-1) ICI 118 551). CHEMICALNOTIN decreased diastolic (1.3- to 1.6-fold; P < 0.05) and systolic blood pressure (1.3-fold; P < 0.05), and doses > 0.3 mmol kg(-1) increased heart rate (1.4-fold; P < 0.05). CHEMICALNOTIN increased heart rate (1.2- to 1.4-fold; P < 0.05), and doses > 0.3 mmol kg(-1) decreased diastolic blood pressure (1.3-fold; P < 0.05). In conclusion, the cardiotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN was similar to CHEMICALNOTIN and greater than CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN had less desirable haemodynamic effects.
23315644	Characterization of four new GENENOTIN enzymes of the GENENOTIN subfamily. The GENENOTIN superfamily encompasses a diverse group of enzymes that catalyze the oxidation of various substrates. The mouse GENEIN subfamily includes members that have wide tissue distribution and are active in the metabolism of CHEMICALIN (AA), CHEMICALIN (LA), and other lipids and xenobiotics. The GENENOTIN locus contains seven genes and three pseudogenes located in a contiguous 0.62 megabase cluster on chromosome 4. We describe four new GENENOTIN isoforms (designated GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN). The four cDNAs contain open reading frames that encode polypeptides with 62-84% identity with the three previously identified GENENOTIN. All four new GENENOTIN proteins were expressed in Sf21 insect cells. Each recombinant protein metabolized AA and LA to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives. Specific antibodies, mRNA probes, and polymerase chain reaction primer sets were developed for each mouse GENENOTIN to examine their tissue distribution. GENENOTIN transcripts were found in the kidney, liver, and brain, and protein expression was confirmed in the kidney and brain (neuropil). GENENOTIN transcripts were most abundant in the kidney and heart, with protein detected primarily in the kidney (proximal convoluted tubules), liver, and heart (cardiomyocytes). GENENOTIN transcripts were prominently present in the brain, and GENENOTIN transcripts were detected in multiple tissues, with the highest expression in the kidney. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN protein expression could not be determined because the antibodies developed were not immunospecific. We conclude that the four new GENENOTIN isoforms might be involved in the metabolism of AA and LA to bioactive lipids in mouse hepatic and extrahepatic tissues.
23313730	The effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) in control and GENENOTIN transfected HEK cells. Chronic exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN results in the development of a neurological disorder known as manganism characterized by neurological deficits resembling that seen in Parkinsonism. Although dopaminergic neurons within the nigrostriatal pathway appear intact, CHEMICALIN-induced irregularities in DA transmission have been observed including decreased CHEMICALNOTIN-induced DA release and loss of the GENEIN (GENEIN). Results of studies to evaluate the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and DA on cell viability in control and GENENOTIN-transfected HEK cells reveal that CHEMICALIN is equally toxic to both cell lines whereas DA was only toxic to cells containing GENEIN. DA toxicity was saturable suggesting that transport may be rate limiting. When CHEMICALNOTIN and DA were added simultaneously to the media, cell toxicity was similar to that produced by CHEMICALNOTIN alone suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN may suppress DA uptake in the GENENOTIN containing cells. Preincubation of DA prior to the addition of CHEMICALNOTIN resulted in cell death which was essentially additive with that produced independently by the two agents. CHEMICALIN was also shown to decrease DA uptake and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced DA efflux in GENEIN containing cells. Time-lapsed confocal microscopy indicates that CHEMICALIN can promote trafficking of cell surface GENEIN into intracellular compartments which may account for the decrease in DA uptake and DA efflux in these cells. CHEMICALIN-induced internalization of GENEIN may provide an explanation for disruption in DA transmission previously reported in the striatum.
14711372	Structural model of GENENOTIN based on the GENENOTIN crystal. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyses the conversion of CHEMICALIN into CHEMICALIN in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, facilitating the entry of CHEMICALNOTIN into mitochondria. We propose a 3-D (three-dimensional) structural model for GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), based on the similarity of this enzyme to the recently crystallized GENENOTIN. The model includes 607 of the 773 CHEMICALIN of GENEIN, and the positions of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and the CHEMICALNOTIN group were assigned by superposition and docking analysis. Functional analysis of this 3-D model included the mutagenesis of several CHEMICALNOTIN in order to identify putative catalytic residues. Mutants GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN showed reduced GENENOTIN activity. In addition, individual mutation of CHEMICALNOTIN forming the conserved Ser685-Thr686-Ser687 motif abolished enzyme activity in mutants GENENOTIN and GENENOTINA and altered K(m) and the catalytic efficiency for CHEMICALNOTIN in mutant GENENOTIN. We conclude that the catalytic residues are His473 and Asp477, while Ser687 probably stabilizes the transition state. Several conserved lysines, i.e. Lys455, Lys505, Lys560 and Lys561, were also mutated. Only mutants GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN showed decreases in activity of 50%. The model rationalizes the finding of nine natural mutations in patients with hereditary GENENOTIN deficiencies.
23500545	CHEMICALNOTIN in cancer cell proliferation and death. CHEMICALNOTIN have been shown to interfere with proliferation and cause the death of many cancer cell types, such as leukaemia, glioblastoma, colon, breast and prostate cancer cells, while they have little or no effect on senescent cells. The mechanisms by which CHEMICALNOTIN may influence proliferation are manifold: they control the transcription and the turnover of the key enzyme in CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis, GENENOTIN, by binding to GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN are thought to be generated in proportion to the rate of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis. Although there is no consensus about the mechanism by which these CHEMICALNOTIN are generated in vivo, it clearly has to be ubiquitous. The GENENOTIN, present in almost all tissues, are possible candidates. CHEMICALIN uptake from GENEIN, intracellular vesicle transport and lipid transfer are also modified by CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN interfere with GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN pathways of proliferation and differentiation. When administered in vitro to cancer cell lines, CHEMICALNOTIN invariably both slow down proliferation and provoke cell death. Perhaps is it sufficient to stop proliferation of a cancer to provoke its eradication. Therefore, the two facets of CHEMICALNOTIN action that seem important for cancer treatment, cytostaticity and cytotoxicity, will be discussed.
23473032	In vivo GENEIN-mediated reductive carboxylation is regulated by CHEMICALIN levels and sensitizes GENENOTIN-deficient cells to CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation. Hypoxic and GENENOTIN-deficient cells use CHEMICALNOTIN to generate CHEMICALNOTIN and lipids through reductive carboxylation (RC) of CHEMICALNOTIN. To gain insights into the role of GENENOTIN and the molecular mechanisms underlying RC, we took advantage of a panel of disease-associated GENENOTIN mutants and showed that GENENOTIN expression is necessary and sufficient for the induction of RC in human renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells. GENENOTIN expression drastically reduced intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels. Feeding GENENOTIN-deficient RCC cells with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN or knocking down GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN restored CHEMICALNOTIN levels and suppressed RC. These data suggest that GENENOTIN-induced low intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels promote the reductive flux by mass action to maintain lipogenesis. Using CHEMICALNOTIN, we demonstrated in vivo RC activity in GENENOTIN-deficient tumors growing as xenografts in mice. Lastly, GENENOTIN rendered GENENOTIN-deficient cells sensitive to CHEMICALNOTIN deprivation in vitro, and systemic administration of GENENOTIN inhibitors suppressed the growth of RCC cells as mice xenografts.
23301897	Bioactive CHEMICALNOTIN and other constituents isolated from Aglaia perviridis. Eight new compounds, including two CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives (1, 2), two CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives (3, 4), three CHEMICALNOTIN (5-7), and an apocarotenoid (8), together with 16 known compounds, were isolated from the CHEMICALNOTIN-soluble partitions of separate CHEMICALNOTIN extracts of a combination of the fruits, leaves, and twigs and of the roots of Aglaia perviridis collected in Vietnam. Isolation work was monitored using human colon cancer cells (HT-29) and facilitated with an LC/MS dereplication procedure. The structures of the new compounds (1-8) were determined on the basis of spectroscopic data interpretation. The Mosher ester method was employed to determine the absolute configurations of 5-7, and the absolute configuration of the 9,10-CHEMICALNOTIN unit of compound 8 was established by a CHEMICALNOTIN [CHEMICALNOTIN] induced circular dichroism procedure. Seven known CHEMICALNOTIN derivatives (9-15) exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the HT-29 cell line, with CHEMICALNOTIN (9) being the most potent (ED50 0.0007 Î¼M). The new compounds 2-4 were also active against this cell line, with ED50 values ranging from 0.46 to 4.7 Î¼M. The cytotoxic compounds were evaluated against a normal colon cell line, CCD-112CoN. In addition, the new compound CHEMICALIN (2), three known CHEMICALIN derivatives (9, 11, 12), and a known CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN (17), showed significant GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitory activity in an ELISA assay.
23567950	Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel CHEMICALNOTIN for anticancer chemotherapy: Part II. A series of novel CHEMICALNOTIN were synthesized and evaluated for their anticancer effects involving induction of GENENOTIN. Most of these compounds, featuring open-ring forms of CHEMICALNOTIN, exhibited potent anti-proliferative activities in human cancer cell lines, including PC-3, NUGC-3, MDA-MB-231, ACHN, HCT-15, and NCI-H23. In further evaluation, the representative compound CHEMICALIN (3b) exhibited potent pro-apoptotic activity, through GENEIN activation, in HeLa cells.
16876126	RNA interference-triggered reversal of GENEIN-dependent CHEMICALIN resistance in human cancer cells. The GENEIN GENEIN (GENEIN/GENEIN) can mediate resistance against the commonly used anticancer drugs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. To overcome the GENENOTIN-depending drug resistance, two specific anti-GENENOTIN small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were designed for transient triggering of the gene-silencing RNA interference (RNAi) pathway in the CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant human ovarian carcinoma cell line A2780RCIS. Since both siRNAs showed biological activity, for stable inhibition of GENENOTIN a corresponding short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-encoding expression vector was designed. By treatment of A2780RCIS cells with this construct, the expressions of the targeted GENENOTIN encoding mRNA and transport protein were inhibited. These effects were accompanied by reversal of resistance against CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Thus, the data demonstrate the utility of the analyzed RNAs as powerful laboratory tools and indicate that siRNA- and shRNA-mediated RNAi-based gene therapeutic approaches may be applicable in preventing and reversing GENENOTIN-depending drug resistance.
8836655	CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) modulates the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro by a prejunctional GENEIN. Electrical field stimulation (EFS) of guinea-pig airways, in vitro, evokes an excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic (eNANC) contraction mediated by release of tachykinins from sensory nerve endings. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is an antihistaminic drug with binding affinity at certain other receptors, including GENEIN and various GENEIN subtypes. It is used in asthma treatment; however, its mechanism of action remains to be fully defined. We have investigated whether CHEMICALNOTIN could modulate the eNANC contraction in guinea-pig airways in vitro, and have tried to elucidate its receptor mechanism. CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1-100 microM) produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the noncholinergic contraction, with a maximum inhibition of 91 +/- 7% at 100 microM. Pretreatment of the tissues with combined GENEIN/GENEIN antagonists, CHEMICALIN (1 microM) or CHEMICALIN (0.1 microM), significantly attenuated the inhibitory effect of CHEMICALIN on the noncholinergic contraction. Pretreatment with CHEMICALIN (1 microM), a GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (10 microM), a GENEIN antagonist, CHEMICALIN (10 microM), a GENEIN antagonist, or CHEMICALNOTIN (10 microM), an alpha-adrenergic antagonist, however, had no effect. CHEMICALIN (10 microM), another GENEIN antagonist without significant GENEIN binding affinity, did not produce any inhibition of the eNANC contraction. CHEMICALIN (100 microM) did not displace the dose-response curve to exogenously applied GENEIN (0.01-10 microM). These results suggest that CHEMICALIN, although identified as a CHEMICALNOTIN antagonist, acts as a GENEIN agonist and that it inhibits the noncholinergic contraction in guinea-pig airways through stimulation of a prejunctional GENEIN, located to sensory nerves.
23615073	CHEMICALIN forestalls cigarette smoke induced GENEIN activation in alveolar epithelial cells. Cigarette smoking causes cellular oxidative stress resulting in inflammatory diseases of lung wherein transcription factor GENENOTIN plays an important role. It is possible that CHEMICALIN, an antioxidant, may prevent cigarette smoke (CS)-induced GENEIN activation that involves degradation of GENEIN and nuclear translocation of GENEIN/GENEIN in alveolar epithelial cells. Therefore, to examine the hypothesis, we verified the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CS-induced expression of GENENOTIN driven luciferase reporter and GENENOTIN binding at its target DNA by EMSA in alveolar epithelial A549 cells. We also examined the level of GENENOTIN and sub-cellular distribution of GENENOTIN by western blotting and immunofluorescence respectively in CSE-treated A549 cells with or without CHEMICALNOTIN pretreatment. We observed a significant reduction in CSE induced luciferase expression, GENEIN DNA binding, GENEIN degradation and GENEIN nuclear translocation in cells pretreated with CHEMICALIN. To further validate the result, we examined sub-cellular distribution of GENENOTIN in lungs of CS-exposed guinea pigs treated or untreated with CHEMICALNOTIN. Result showed that CHEMICALIN treatment resulted in markedly reduced GENEIN nuclear translocation. All these results demonstrate that CHEMICALIN prevents CS(E)-induced GENEIN activation and thus it could be used for the prevention of CS-induced inflammatory diseases.
23376161	CHEMICALNOTIN suppresses advanced glycation end-products-induced inflammatory responses through inhibition of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species in human monocytic THP-1 cells. Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) play a pivotal role in the development of diabetic complications by inducing inflammation. We previously reported that the fresh roots of Rehmannia glutinosa Libosch., which have been used for the treatment of diabetes in traditional Korean medicine, also have the potential to suppress AGE-mediated inflammatory response in THP-1 cells. In the present study, we isolated CHEMICALNOTIN from R. glutinosa, and examined whether it has anti-inflammatory effects on AGE-stimulated THP-1 cells. CHEMICALIN reduced the expression of pro-inflammatory mediates, such as GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN (GENEIN), and GENEIN (GENEIN). Promoter and electromobility shift assays showed that transcriptional activation of GENEIN was significantly reduced by CHEMICALIN treatment, while GENEIN was not. CHEMICALIN also suppressed AGE-induced phosphorylation of GENEIN, degradation of GENEIN and the nuclear localization of GENEIN. Moreover, the production of intracellular reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) elicited by AGE was also suppressed by CHEMICALIN treatment, through dual action of reducing ROS itself and inhibiting GENEIN activity. Our findings indicate that CHEMICALIN suppresses AGE-mediated inflammation by inhibiting ROS production and GENEIN activity. We suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN, a major constituent of the fresh roots of R. glutinosa, contributes to the prevention of AGE-mediated diabetic complications.
20596674	CHEMICALNOTIN enhances CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cytotoxic, apoptotic and anti-GENENOTIN effects in a human colon carcinoma cell line. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor chemotherapeutic agent. Studies have shown that a combination of CHEMICALNOTIN with other drugs demonstrates better clinical responses. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN on cellular GENENOTIN activity in drug-treated cells and evaluate the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN on the mode of action of CHEMICALNOTIN, on proliferation and apoptosis of HT-29 cells. Decatenation assay, band depletion and Western blot analysis, cytotoxic assay (CHEMICALNOTIN), flow cytometric studies (cell cycle and survivin expression), apoptosis (CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN staining and GENENOTIN activity) and GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN secretion were determined. CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN slightly affected cellular GENEIN activity in nuclear extracts derived from drug-treated cells while the combination enhanced inhibitory activity and the reduction in band depletion of GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M and the appearance of the subG1 peak which was increased by the addition of CHEMICALNOTIN. Apoptosis studies (CHEMICALNOTIN staining and GENEIN activity) showed a marked increase in the presence of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN compared to CHEMICALIN alone. CHEMICALIN induced the release of GENEIN, and addition of CHEMICALIN reduced enhanced release and the spontaneous release of GENEIN from the cells. In conclusion, the results suggest that the enhancement in the reduction of GENEIN activity by the combined CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN treatments was probably due to the increase in the level of the DNA-enzyme cleavable complexes formed by both drugs. The unique combination of CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN may have clinical benefits and a cytotoxic drug 'sparing effect' and should be further studied in vivo.
14719072	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN level as the main predictive parameter for sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN in a mouse model. CHEMICALNOTIN is a new oral anti-cancer drug preparation, composed of a 1:0.5 mixture (on a molar basis) of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). CHEMICALIN currently undergoing clinical trials, has been demonstrated to have at least two mechanisms, inhibition of GENEIN and incorporation into DNA. We hypothesized that the CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism enzyme may be a crucial factor that affects the antitumor activity of CHEMICALNOTIN. In the present study, we measured the enzyme activity of GENEIN (GENENOTIN), GENEIN (GENENOTIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) in human cancer xenografts to investigate the contribution of these enzymes to the sensitivity of CHEMICALIN. Antitumor activity of CHEMICALIN appears to be associated with GENENOTIN, tumor growth and GENEIN. However, the most related factors in this study were the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN ratio. There was a significant correlation (p=0.04) between tumor growth inhibition and this ratio. These results suggested that the activation and degradation pattern of CHEMICALNOTIN plays an important role in the efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN and that it is possible to use the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ratio to predict response to CHEMICALNOTIN therapy. We also studied the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN on the capacity of exogenous dThd to reverse CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent growth inhibition. CHEMICALNOTIN (dThd) levels rescued the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in vitro and significantly increased in serum after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN alone but not CHEMICALNOTIN alone. This may suggest the possibility of a decrease in antitumor effect. However, our study indicated that the therapeutic index was clearly increased by CHEMICALNOTIN combined with CHEMICALNOTIN, compared with CHEMICALNOTIN alone, suggesting CHEMICALNOTIN-induced toxicity to sensitive host tissue can be selectively reversed with dThd. In conclusion, GENENOTIN and CHEMICALIN effects on GENEIN play important roles in the cytotoxic action of CHEMICALNOTIN, and it is possible to use the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN ratio to predict more precisely individual resistance or sensitivity.
23554049	CHEMICALIN Presents Synergistic Anti-proliferative Activity With CHEMICALIN Via Altering Cell Cycle and GENEIN Signaling in 95-D Lung Cancer Cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a natural CHEMICALNOTIN isolated from Rhizoma Curcumae, a well-known Chinese medicinal herb that presents anti-proliferative activities in several cancer cell lines. Recently, we found that the combined treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) showed synergetic anti-proliferative activities in 95-D lung cancer cells. Herein, we showed that CHEMICALNOTIN reduced the cell numbers distributed in mitosis phase induced by CHEMICALNOTIN while increased those in G1 phase. The protein levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were all down-regulated in the group of combined treatment. The dramatically down-regulated expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN might partially contribute to the synergic effect. Though CHEMICALNOTIN alone obviously induced endoplasmic reticulum stress, this signaling pathway may not contribute to the synergetic anti-proliferative effect as the protein expression of GENEIN and GENEIN was similar in CHEMICALIN alone and combined treatment group.

21838705	The mechanisms responsible for garlic - drug interactions and their in vivo relevance. Garlic phytochemicals and garlic supplements influence the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behavior of concomitantly ingested drugs. In this paper we have summarized the mechanisms responsible for first-pass intestinal pharmacokinetic interactions by investigating the intestinal permeability of some cardiovascular, antiviral drugs, their transport with hepatic transporters and GENENOTIN metabolism. Transporter-enzyme interplay was studied with several in vitro models of varying complexity: rat small intestine and Caco-2 cell monolayers were used in studies of intestinal processes, and hepatic pharmacokinetics was monitored in HepG2 cells, isolated rat hepatocytes and rat liver slices. Garlic phytochemicals from aged garlic extract modified the activities of secretory and absorptive transporters in both intestine and liver and competitively inhibited GENENOTIN enzyme. The increased activities of the most important intestinal efflux (GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN) and uptake (GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN) transporters were caused by changes in electrophysiological membrane properties and by allosteric modifications. Because clinical studies investigating interactions between garlic and GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN have already been performed, we used these in vivo data to evaluate the in vitro results and the reliability of the models employed as screening tools for forecasting the potential of first-pass intestinal metabolism changes. We also assessed the probability of pharmacokinetic interactions with garlic of the novel drug CHEMICALNOTIN and other cardiovascular drugs. Finally, selected garlic phytochemicals were tested for their ability to influence GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities.
1361547	The effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on isolated cardiovascular preparations of the guinea-pig and rat. Differing effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on cardiovascular preparations have been reported. I have studied the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the contractile responses of the rat and guinea-pig left atria and rat portal vein. On the guinea-pig left atria low concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN (> or = 10(-8) M) and of CHEMICALNOTIN (> or = 10(-7) M) inhibited to a small extent the responses to electrical cardiac stimulation, which is indicative of membrane stabilizing activity. CHEMICALIN (> or = 3 x 10(-8) M) and CHEMICALIN (> or = 10(-8) M) caused surmountable antagonism of the CHEMICALIN responses of the atria and the pA2 values were 8.60 and 8.98 at the GENEIN of the rat left atria and 7.90 and 8.31, respectively, on the guinea-pig left atria which has functional GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (both at > or = 10(-7) M) attenuated the spontaneous contractile activity of the rat portal vein and the attenuation to CHEMICALNOTIN at 10(-6) M was abolished by CHEMICALIN which illustrates that the CHEMICALIN-induced attenuation is GENEIN mediated. The CHEMICALNOTIN attenuation responses of the portal vein were inhibited by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (both at > or = 10(-7) M) and the pA2 value for the CHEMICALIN at GENEIN was 7.59. It is concluded that CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are GENEIN selective antagonists.
10682471	[Effect of CHEMICALIN on the expression of GENEIN messenger RNA and protein in uterine leiomyomata]. OBJECTIVE: To determine the expression of GENEIN (GENEIN) mRNA and GENEIN levels in the myometrium and leiomyomata from untreated and CHEMICALIN pretreated women with leiomyoma and to examine the mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment on uterine leiomyomata. METHODS: Expression of GENEIN and GENEIN were determined by Northern blot and HAP of single-dose saturated analysis in myometrium and leiomyomata (center and marginal area) from 27 untreated and 6 CHEMICALIN pretreated women with leiomyomata. RESULTS: GENENOTIN abundance and GENENOTIN levels in both myomatous center and marginal area were significantly greater than those in corporal myometrium (P < 0.01) in both follicular and luteal phases, but similar between myomatous center and marginal area (P > 0.05). 6 cases pretreated with CHEMICALNOTIN 25 mg/day for 3 months were operated, all but one patient displayed a decrease in leiomyomata volume. GENEIN abundance in both myometruim and leiomyomata (center and marginal area) was significantly decreased in 4 patients continuing CHEMICALIN treatment before the operation but not in the other 2 patients stopping CHEMICALNOTIN 1 month before operation. GENENOTIN levels in these tissues showed significant decrease in all 6 cases. CONCLUSION: There are overexpression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in leiomyomata. One of the mechanism of CHEMICALIN action on decreasing leiomyomata volume may be related to suppression on expression of GENEIN. It seems that suppression on transcription of GENENOTIN is reversible, but on translation of GENENOTIN may maintain in a relatively longer period.
10954021	Accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN in whole brain and various regions of the brain of CHEMICALNOTIN-treated rats. Experimental cystathioninuria was induced in rats by administration of the GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), were identified in whole brain and various regions of the brain in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated rats. The concentration of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in whole brain and various regions of the brain increased gradually after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN, and reached the highest value at about 20 hours. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulated in whole brain and various regions of the brain in proportion to the amount of accumulated cystathionine after CHEMICALNOTIN administration. The concentration of these compounds in the cerebellum was higher versus the other regions of the rat brain.
23435160	Changes in A1C Levels Are Significantly Associated With Changes in Levels of the Cardiovascular Risk Biomarker hs-CRP: Results from SteP Study. OBJECTIVEThe effect of therapeutic strategies on cardiovascular (CV) disease can be evaluated by monitoring changes in CV risk biomarkers. This study investigated the effect of a structured self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) protocol and the resulting improvements in glycemic control on changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) in insulin-naÃ¯ve patients with type 2 diabetes.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSThe Structured Testing Program (STeP) study was a prospective, cluster-randomized, multicenter trial in which 483 poorly controlled, insulin-naÃ¯ve patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to active control (ACG) or structured testing (STG) that included quarterly structured SMBG. Changes in A1C, hs-CRP, and glycemic variability (STG subjects only) were measured at baseline and quarterly.RESULTSReductions in geometric mean hs-CRP values were significantly greater in the STG group at months 3 (P = 0.005), 6 (P = 0.0003), and 12 (P = 0.04) than in the ACG group. STG patients at high CV risk (>3 mg/L) showed significantly greater reductions in hs-CRP levels than ACG patients at high CV risk: -3.64 mg/dL (95% CI -4.21 to -3.06) versus -2.18 mg/dL (-2.93 to -1.43), respectively (P = 0.002). There was a strong correlation between reductions in hs-CRP and A1C in both groups: standardized coefficient (Î²) was 0.25 for the entire cohort (P < 0.0001), 0.31 for STG (P < 0.0001), and 0.16 for ACG (P = 0.02).CONCLUSIONSReductions in hs-CRP level are associated with reductions in A1C but not reductions in lipids or glycemic variability. Comprehensive structured SMBG-based interventions that lower A1C may translate into improvements in CV risk, as evidenced by levels of the biomarker hs-CRP.
17085856	GENENOTIN antagonists intensify the CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal signs in mice. The aim of the present experiment was to assess the involvement of GENENOTIN antagonists in CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) withdrawal signs, observed as the seizure susceptibility in mice. The discontinuation of chronic treatment with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN decreased seizure threshold (one of CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal signs). The concomitant application of subconvulsive dose of CHEMICALNOTIN (55.0 mg/kg) with low dose of CHEMICALIN (5.0 mg/kg) - a GENEIN antagonist, immediately induced CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal signs in these animals. The non-selective GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN), and the selective GENEIN antagonist (CHEMICALIN), injected 15 min before the application of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, were able to intensify CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal signs in mice. The most apparent effects were observed after administration of CHEMICALNOTIN, indicating that the GENENOTIN may play a more important role in these effects. The obtained data demonstrate that the adenosinergic system is involved in CHEMICALNOTIN withdrawal signs in mice, and GENENOTIN plays an important role in this process.
15102890	Cross-inhibition of GENEIN- and GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN transport by the small molecules BLT-4 and CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN are structurally dissimilar cell surface proteins that play key roles in GENENOTIN metabolism. GENEIN is a receptor that binds GENENOTIN with high affinity and mediates both the selective lipid uptake of CHEMICALIN from lipid-rich GENENOTIN to cells and the efflux of unesterified CHEMICALIN from cells to GENENOTIN. GENEIN mediates the efflux of unesterified CHEMICALIN and phospholipids from cells to lipid-poor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The activities of GENEIN and other GENEIN members are inhibited by the drug CHEMICALIN, and GENENOTIN-mediated lipid transport is blocked by small molecule inhibitors called BLTs. Here, we show that one CHEMICALIN, [CHEMICALIN] (CHEMICALIN), blocked GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALIN efflux to lipid-poor GENENOTIN at a potency similar to that for its inhibition of GENEIN (IC(50) approximately 55-60 microM). Reciprocally, CHEMICALIN blocked GENEIN-mediated selective lipid uptake and efflux at a potency similar to that for its inhibition of GENEIN (IC(50) approximately 275-300 microM). As is the case with BLTs, CHEMICALIN increased the apparent affinity of GENEIN binding to GENEIN. The reciprocal inhibition of GENEIN and GENEIN by BLT-4 and CHEMICALIN raises the possibility that these proteins may share similar or common steps in their mechanisms of lipid transport.
23444334	Protective effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in mice. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the possible ameliorating effect of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), associated with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced oxidative stress and liver injury in mice. The treatment of mice with CHEMICALIN alone enhances GENEIN activity to 4.6 folds, protein CHEMICALNOTIN formation increased up to 2.9 folds and DNA synthesis expressed in terms of CHEMICALNOTIN incorporation increased to 3.2 folds, and antioxidants and antioxidant enzymes decreased to 1.8-2.5 folds, compared with the corresponding saline-treated controls. These changes were reversed significantly (pÂ <Â 0.001) in animals receiving a pretreatment of CHEMICALNOTIN. Our data show that CHEMICALNOTIN can reciprocate the toxic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and can serve as a potent chemopreventive agent.
22872607	GENENOTIN expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes from smokers: The role of body mass index. GENEIN (GENEIN) metabolize a wide range of substrates, including CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), generating metabolites (CHEMICALIN) and reactive CHEMICALIN species (ROS), which are capable of initiating and promoting carcinogenesis. Exposure to CHEMICALIN, their metabolites, and ROS further increase GENEIN isoform expression that may amplify oxidative damage. GENENOTIN enzymes are highly polymorphic, and allelic variants may contribute to different GENENOTIN expression in individuals. Despite the importance of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN metabolism, there are no studies that evaluate, in general human populations, the effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN expression in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs). The aim of this study was to determine the effect of tobacco smoke exposure, and GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN polymorphisms, on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN messenger RNA (mRNA) levels in PBLs from smokers. In the smoker group, there is a statistically significant positive association between GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA induction and urine CHEMICALNOTIN levels in individuals with a body mass index (BMI) less than 25. However, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN alleles did not influence GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN mRNA levels. These results suggest that GENEIN induction by CHEMICALIN in smokers' PBLs is associated with BMI; therefore, the role of adipose tissue accumulation in CHEMICALNOTIN' effects needs further investigation.
23333901	Administration of the optimized CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN-cyclodextrin ternary system induces apoptosis, DNA damage and reduces tumor growth in a human breast adenocarcinoma xenograft mouse model. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a CHEMICALIN that selectively induces cell death in human cancer cells through GENEIN (GENEIN). GENENOTIN is overexpressed in a variety of tumors, as compared to normal adjacent tissue. However, the low solubility and non-specific distribution of CHEMICALNOTIN limit its suitability for clinical assays. We formulated CHEMICALNOTIN in an optimal random CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN mixture (i.e., CHEMICALNOTIN ternary system) and, using human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells and immunodeficient mice, performed in vitro and in vivo evaluation of its anti-tumor effects on proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage, and tumor growth. This ternary system is fluid at room temperature, gels over 29Â°C, and provides a significant amount of drug, thus facilitating intratumoral delivery, in situ gelation, and the formation of a depot for time-release. Administration of CHEMICALNOTIN ternary system to MCF-7 cells induces an increase in apoptosis and DNA damage, while producing no changes in cell cycle. Moreover, in a mouse xenograft tumor model, intratumoral injection of the system significantly reduces tumor volume, while increasing apoptosis and DNA damage without visible toxicity to liver or kidney. These anti-tumoral effects and lack of visible toxicity make this system a promising new therapeutic agent for breast cancer treatment.
23090712	CHEMICALNOTIN regulates the CHEMICALNOTIN assimilation in soybean seedlings under ultraviolet-B radiation. Ultraviolet-B (UV-B, 280-320Â nm) radiation has seriously affected the growth of plants. Finding the technology/method to alleviate the damage of UV-B radiation has become a frontal topic in the field of environmental science. The pretreatment with rare earth elements (REEs) is an effective method, but the regulation mechanism of REEs is unknown. Here, the regulation effects of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) on CHEMICALNOTIN assimilation in soybean seedlings (Glycine max L.) under ultraviolet-B radiation were investigated to elucidate the regulation mechanism of REEs on plants under UV-B radiation. UV-B radiation led to the inhibition in the activities of the key enzymes (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) in the CHEMICALNOTIN assimilation, the decrease in the contents of CHEMICALNOTIN and soluble proteins, as well as the increase in the content of CHEMICALNOTIN in soybean seedlings. The change degree of UV-B radiation at the high level (0.45Â Wâm(-2)) was higher than that of UV-B radiation at the low level (0.15Â Wâm(-2)). The pretreatment with 20Â mgâL(-1) CHEMICALIN could alleviate the effects of UV-B radiation on the activities of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN, promoting CHEMICALNOTIN conversion and protein synthesis in soybean seedlings. The regulation effect of CHEMICALNOTIN under UV-B radiation at the low level was better than that of UV-B radiation at the high level. The results indicated that the pretreatment with 20Â mgâL(-1) CHEMICALNOTIN could alleviate the inhibition of UV-B radiation on CHEMICALNOTIN assimilation in soybean seedlings.
15285788	Significant receptor affinities of metabolites and a degradation product of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a highly potent glucocorticoid used topically to treat inflammation in the lung, nose and on the skin. However, so far no information has been published on the GENENOTIN activity of the metabolites or degradation products of CHEMICALNOTIN. We have now determined the relative receptor binding affinities of the known metabolite CHEMICALNOTIN and the degradation product CHEMICALNOTIN to understand their possible contribution to undesirable systemic side effects. In competition experiments with GENEIN we have determined the relative receptor affinities (RRA) of these substances with reference to CHEMICALIN (RRA = 100). We have discovered that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN display RRAs of 206 +/- 15 and 220 +/- 22, respectively. This level of activity is similar to that of the clinically used inhaled CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (RRA 180 +/- 11). Furthermore we observed that CHEMICALNOTIN is a chemically reactive metabolite. In recovery experiments with human plasma and lung tissue we found a time dependent decrease in extractability of the compound. Hence, we provide data that might contribute to the understanding of the pharmacokinetics as well as the clinical effects of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23374869	Inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN analogues. Based on recent reports that the small molecules, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, are suitable scaffolds for the design of high potency GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors, the present study examines the GENEIN inhibitory properties of a series of CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN] analogues. CHEMICALNOTIN is structurally related to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and it is demonstrated here that substitution at C6 of the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety yields compounds endowed with high binding affinities to both GENENOTIN isoforms. Among the nineteen homologues evaluated, the lowest IC(50) values recorded for the inhibition of GENENOTIN were 0.096 and 0.0014 Î¼M, respectively. In most instances, C6-substituted CHEMICALIN exhibit GENEIN specific inhibition. Among a series of CHEMICALNOTIN bearing substituents on the para position of the CHEMICALNOTIN ring the general order of potency was CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN > CHEMICALNOTIN. The results also show that the binding modes of representative CHEMICALIN are reversible and competitive at both GENEIN isoforms. Based on these data, CHEMICALNOTIN6-substituted CHEMICALNOTIN may serve as leads for the development of therapies for neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's disease.
23139413	Long range effect of mutations on specific conformational changes in the extracellular loop 2 of GENENOTIN. The topology of the second extracellular loop (ECL2) and its interaction with ligands is unique in each GENENOTIN. When the orthosteric ligand pocket located in the transmembrane (TM) domain is occupied, ligand-specific conformational changes occur in the ECL2. In more than 90% of GENENOTIN, ECL2 is tethered to the third TM helix via a disulfide bond. Therefore, understanding the extent to which the TM domain and ECL2 conformations are coupled is useful. To investigate this, we examined conformational changes in ECL2 of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) by introducing mutations in distant sites that alter the activation state equilibrium of the GENENOTIN. Differential accessibility of reporter CHEMICALNOTIN introduced at four conformation-sensitive sites in ECL2 of these mutants was measured. Binding of the agonist GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and inverse agonist CHEMICALIN in wild-type GENEIN changed the accessibility of reporter CHEMICALIN, and the pattern was consistent with ligand-specific "lid" conformations of ECL2. Without agonist stimulation, the ECL2 in the gain of function mutant GENENOTIN assumed a lid conformation similar to GENENOTIN-bound wild-type GENENOTIN. In the presence of inverse agonists, the conformation of ECL2 in the GENENOTIN mutant was similar to the inactive state of wild-type GENENOTIN. In contrast, GENENOTIN did not induce a lid conformation in ECL2 in the loss of function GENENOTIN mutant, which is consistent with the reduced GENENOTIN binding affinity in this mutant. However, a lid conformation was induced by [CHEMICALIN(1),CHEMICALIN(2),CHEMICALIN(8)] GENEIN, a specific analog that binds to the GENEIN mutant with better affinity than GENEIN. These results provide evidence for the emerging paradigm of domain coupling facilitated by long range interactions at distant sites on the same receptor.
20372850	Immunohistochemical characterization of CHEMICALIN synthetic enzymes, GENEIN and GENEIN, in various types of cancer. GENEIN (GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN) are key enzymes for salvage and de novo CHEMICALIN synthesis, respectively. Numerous studies have suggested that increased GENEIN levels are associated closely with resistance to CHEMICALIN-based chemotherapy. CHEMICALIN is a novel drug containing CHEMICALIN, which is phosphorylated by GENEIN to its active monophosphated form, that in turn can inhibit GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to exhibit antitumor activity in CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant human cancer cells. CHEMICALNOTIN is currently undergoing clinical trials for use in gastrointestinal cancers. In the present study, we used immunohistochemistry to investigate the expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in various types of cancer. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN expression was markedly different between cancer types. High GENENOTIN expression was detected prominently in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas. Gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and squamous cell uterine carcinomas were often accompanied by high GENEIN expression, indicating activation of CHEMICALIN synthesis through both the salvage and de novo pathways. These results led us to consider that CHEMICALIN may also be effective for esophageal and uterine squamous cell carcinomas, as well as for gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas, even in CHEMICALIN-resistant cases with high GENEIN expression. In contrast, thyroid papillary carcinomas, lung adenocarcinomas, hepatocellular carcinomas, pancreatic ductal carcinomas, and renal cell carcinomas, which exhibit low GENEIN expression, may be resistant to CHEMICALIN. In non-small cell lung cancers, high GENENOTIN expression was demonstrated in squamous cell carcinomas, but not in adenocarcinomas. This result suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN efficacy and the CHEMICALNOTIN synthetic pathway may differ depending on histological type. Our results indicate that administration of CHEMICALNOTIN could be selected on the basis of the immunohistochemical evaluation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN.
20347047	Increased GENENOTIN activity of airway smooth muscle isolated from a mouse model of allergic asthma. The mechanisms leading to airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR) in asthma are still not fully understood. AHR could be produced by hypersensitivity of the airway smooth muscle or hyperreactivity of the airways. This study was conducted to ascertain whether AHR in a murine model of asthma is produced by changes at the level of the airway smooth muscle. Airway smooth muscle responses were characterised in vitro in isolated trachea spirals from naive mice and from an acute GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) challenge model of allergic asthma. AHR was investigated in vivo in conscious, freely moving mice. Inflammatory cell influx into the lungs and antibody responses to the antigen were also measured. In vitro study of tracheal airway smooth muscle from naive mice demonstrated concentration-related contractions to CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, but no responses to CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN or its stable analogue, CHEMICALNOTIN. The contractions to CHEMICALNOTIN were inhibited by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN indicating involvement of GENEIN and GENEIN receptors, respectively. In an acute model of allergic asthma, GENENOTIN-treated mice were shown to be atopic by inflammatory cell influx to the lungs after GENENOTIN challenge, increases in total GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN-specific GENENOTIN levels and contractions to GENENOTIN in isolated trachea. In the asthmatic model, AHR to CHEMICALNOTIN was demonstrated in conscious, freely moving mice in vivo and in isolated trachea in vitro 24 and 72h after GENENOTIN challenge. No AHR in vitro was seen for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN. These results suggest that, in our mouse model of asthma, changes occur at the level of the GENENOTIN transduction pathway of coupling to airway smooth muscle contraction. These changes are maintained when tissues are removed from the inflammatory environment and for at least 3 days.
23357629	Design, synthesis, characterization and anti-inflammatory evaluation of novel CHEMICALNOTIN amalgamated CHEMICALNOTIN. A series of novel CHEMICALNOTIN amalgamated CHEMICALNOTIN has been designed and synthesized from CHEMICALNOTIN 6. The structures of regioisomers 6 and 7 were resolved by 2D CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN COSY, CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN HSQC and CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN HMBC experiments. The newly synthesized compounds were tested for their in vitro GENENOTIN inhibition and in vivo carrageenan induced hind paw edema in rats and CHEMICALNOTIN induced vascular permeability in mice. Although the compounds have inhibitory profile against both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, some of the compounds are found to be selective against GENENOTIN, supported by inhibition of paw edema and vascular permeability. Docking studies were also carried out to determine the structural features which sway the anti-inflammatory activity of the tested compounds. The CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN -CHEMICALIN are major factors that are prominently involved in interaction with GENEIN active site.
23627806	Superparamagnetic Hollow Hybrid Nanogels as a Potential Guidable Vehicle System of Stimuli-Mediated MR Imaging and Multiple Cancer Therapeutics. Hollow hybrid nanogels were prepared first by co-assembly of the citric acid-coated superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) (44 wt%) with the graft copolymer (56 wt%) comprising acrylic acid and 2-methacryloylethyl acrylate units as the backbone and poly(ethylene glycol) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) as the grafts in aqueous phase of pH 3.0 into the hybrid vesicle structure, followed by in situ covalent stabilization via the photo-initiated polymerization of MEA residues within vesicles. The resultant hollow nanogels, though slightly swollen, satisfactorily retain the structural integrity while the medium pH being adjusted to 7.4. Confining SPION clusters to such a high level (44 wt%) within the pH-responsive thin gel layer remarkably enhances the transverse relaxivity (r2) and renders the MR imaging highly pH-tunable. For example, with the pH being adjusted from 4.0 to 7.4, the r2 value can be dramatically increased from 138.5 to 265.5 mM-1 s-1. The DOX-loaded hybrid nanogels also exhibit accelerated drug release in response to both pH reduction and temperature increase due to the substantial disruption of the interactions between drug molecules and copolymer components. With magnetic transport guidance toward the target and subsequent exposure to alternating magnetic field, this DOX-loaded nanogel system possessing combined capabilities of hyperthermia and stimuli-triggered drug release showed superior in vitro cytotoxicity against HeLa cells as compared to the case with only free drug or hyperthermia alone. This work demonstrates that the hollow inorganic/organic hybrid nanogels show great potential to serve as a multimodal theranostic vehicle functionalized with such desirable features as guidable delivery of stimuli-mediated diagnostic imaging and hyperthermia/chemotherapies.
23640331	Progesterone receptor induces bcl-x expression through intragenic binding sites favoring RNA polymerase II elongation. Steroid receptors were classically described for regulating transcription by binding to target gene promoters. However, genome-wide studies reveal that steroid receptors-binding sites are mainly located at intragenic regions. To determine the role of these sites, we examined the effect of progestins on the transcription of the bcl-x gene, where only intragenic progesterone receptor-binding sites (PRbs) were identified. We found that in response to hormone treatment, the PR is recruited to these sites along with two histone acetyltransferases CREB-binding protein (CBP) and GCN5, leading to an increase in histone H3 and H4 acetylation and to the binding of the SWI/SNF complex. Concomitant, a more relaxed chromatin was detected along bcl-x gene mainly in the regions surrounding the intragenic PRbs. PR also mediated the recruitment of the positive elongation factor pTEFb, favoring RNA polymerase II (Pol II) elongation activity. Together these events promoted the re-distribution of the active Pol II toward the 3'-end of the gene and a decrease in the ratio between proximal and distal transcription. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which PR regulates gene expression by facilitating the proper passage of the polymerase along hormone-dependent genes.
23552263	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibition of the aerial parts of the Polygonatum verticillatum. Over expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN has already contributed to the pathology of different human disease. Targeting the inhibition of these enzymes has proved great clinical utility. The aim of the present study was to scrutinised the inhibitory profile of the aerial parts of the Polygonatum verticillatum enzyme against GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) using standard experimental protocols. When checked against GENENOTIN, the extracts revealed significant attenuation. Of the tested extracts, the CHEMICALNOTIN fraction was the most potent (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50): 97 Âµg/mL) followed by aqueous fraction IC50: 109 Âµg/mL). Regarding GENEIN inhibition, CHEMICALIN was the most potent fraction (IC50: 97 Âµg/mL). However, the extracts did not show significant inhibition on GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. In the preliminary phytochemical tests, the aerial parts of the plant showed the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN, alkaloids, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. The current findings could be attributed to these groups of compounds.
23314320	A physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for the CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN: simulation of rodent and human data. Multiple CHEMICALNOTIN have been synthesized and evaluated for use as countermeasures against chemical warfare nerve agents. The current U.S. military and civilian CHEMICALNOTIN countermeasure, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), is under consideration for replacement with a more effective GENEIN reactivator, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Kinetic data in the scientific literature for CHEMICALNOTIN are limited; therefore, a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed for a structurally related CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN. Based on a previous model structure for the CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, the model includes key sites of GENENOTIN inhibition (brain and diaphragm), as well as fat, kidney, liver, rapidly perfused tissues and slowly perfused tissues. All tissue compartments are diffusion limited. Model parameters were collected from the literature, predicted using quantitative structure-property relationships or, when necessary, fit to available pharmacokinetic data from the literature. The model was parameterized using rat plasma, tissue and urine time course data from intramuscular administration, as well as human blood and urine data from intravenous and intramuscular administration; sensitivity analyses were performed. The PBPK model successfully simulates rat and human data sets and has been evaluated by predicting intravenous mouse and intramuscular human data not used in the development of the model. Monte Carlo analyses were performed to quantify human population kinetic variability in the human evaluation data set. The model identifies potential pharmacokinetic differences between rodents and humans, indicated by differences in model parameters between species. The PBPK model can be used to optimize the dosing regimen to improve CHEMICALNOTIN therapeutic efficacy in a human population.
23493374	GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN complex transactivates postnatal murine neuronal GENENOTIN expression. The murine neuronal facilitative GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is developmentally regulated, peaking in expression at postnatal day (PN)14. In the present study, we characterized a canonical CHEMICALNOTIN island spanning the 5'-flanking region of the GENENOTIN gene. Methylation-specific PCR and CHEMICALNOTIN sequencing identified methylation of this CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) island of the GENENOTIN gene, frequency of methylation increasing 2.5-fold with a 1.6-fold increase in GENEIN concentrations noted with advancing postnatal age (PN14 vs PN3). 5'-flanking region of GENENOTIN-luciferase reporter transient transfection in HT22 hippocampal neurons demonstrated that CHEMICALIN inhibit GENEIN transcription. Contrary to this biological function, GENENOTIN expression rises synchronously with CHEMICALNOTIN in PN14 vs PN3 neurons. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (IP) revealed that GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) bound the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN. Depending on association with specific coregulators, GENENOTIN, a dual regulator of gene transcription, may repress or activate a downstream gene. Sequential chromatin IP uncovered the GENEIN-CHEMICALIN to bind GENENOTIN exponentially upon recruitment of GENENOTIN rather than GENENOTIN. Co-IP and coimmunolocalization confirmed that GENENOTIN associated with GENENOTIN and cotransfection with GENEIN-CHEMICALIN in HT22 cells enhanced GENENOTIN transcription. Separate CHEMICALIN pretreatment or in combination with CHEMICALIN reduced CHEMICALNOTIN and specific small interference RNAs targeting GENEIN and GENEIN separately or together depleting GENENOTIN and/or GENENOTIN binding of GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN reduced GENENOTIN expression in HT22 cells. We conclude that GENENOTIN is a methylation-sensitive neuronal gene that recruits GENENOTIN. Recruitment of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN by GENEIN-CHEMICALIN contributes towards transactivation, formulating an escape from CHEMICALNOTIN-induced gene suppression, and thereby promoting developmental neuronal GENENOTIN gene transcription and expression.
14676196	Structure of human microsomal cytochrome P450 2C8. Evidence for a peripheral fatty acid binding site. A 2.7-Angstrom molecular structure of human microsomal cytochrome P450 2C8 (CYP2C8) was determined by x-ray crystallography. The membrane protein was modified for crystallization by replacement of the hydrophobic N-terminal transmembrane domain with a short hydrophilic sequence before residue 28. The structure of the native sequence is complete from residue 28 to the beginning of a C-terminal histidine tag used for purification. CYP2C8 is one of the principal hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes that oxidizes therapeutic drugs such as taxol and cerivastatin and endobiotics such as retinoic acid and arachidonic acid. Consistent with the relatively large size of its preferred substrates, the active site volume is twice that observed for the structure of CYP2C5. The extended active site cavity is bounded by the beta1 sheet and helix F' that have not previously been implicated in substrate recognition by mammalian P450s. CYP2C8 crystallized as a symmetric dimer formed by the interaction of helices F, F', G', and G. Two molecules of palmitic acid are bound in the dimer interface. The dimer is observed in solution, and mass spectrometry confirmed the association of palmitic acid with the enzyme. This novel finding identifies a peripheral binding site in P450s that may contribute to drug-drug interactions in P450 metabolism.
23371032	Resistance to conventional insecticides in Pakistani populations of Musca domestica L. (Diptera: Muscidae): a potential ectoparasite of dairy animals. The house fly, Musca domestica L., is an important hygienic pest of humans and dairy animals with the potential to develop resistance to most chemical classes of insecticides. Six adult house fly strains from dairy farms in Punjab, Pakistan were evaluated for resistance to selected insecticides from organochlorine, organophosphate, carbamate and pyrethroid classes. For a chlorocyclodiene and two organophosphates tested, the resistance ratios (RR) at LC50 were in the range of 5.60-22.02 fold for endosulfan, 7.66-23.24 fold for profenofos and 2.47-7.44 fold for chlorpyrifos. For two pyrethroids and one carbamate, the RR values at LC50 were 30.22-70.02 for cypermethrin, 5.73-18.31 for deltamethrin, and 4.39-15.50 for methomyl. This is the first report of resistance to different classes of insecticides in Pakistani dairy populations of house flies. Regular insecticide resistance monitoring programs on dairy farms are needed to prevent field control failures. Moreover, integrated approaches including the judicious use of insecticides are needed to delay the development of insecticide resistance in house flies.
16554743	Effect of antidepressant drugs in mice lacking the GENENOTIN. One of the main theories concerning the mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs (ADs) is based on the notion that the neurochemical background of depression involves an impairment of central noradrenergic transmission with a concomitant decrease of the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in the synaptic gap. Many ADs increase synaptic CHEMICALNOTIN availability by inhibition of the reuptake of CHEMICALNOTIN. Using mice lacking GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-/-) we examined their baseline phenotype as well as the response in the forced swim test (FST) and in the tail suspension test (TST) upon treatment with ADs that display different pharmacological profiles. In both tests, the GENENOTIN-/- mice behaved like wild-type (WT) mice acutely treated with ADs. Autoradiographic studies showed decreased binding of the beta-adrenergic ligand CHEMICALIN in the cerebral cortex of GENENOTIN-/- mice, indicating the changes at the level of GENEIN similar to those obtained with ADs treatment. The binding of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN in the cerebral cortex of GENENOTIN-/- mice was also decreased, most probably as an adaptive response to the sustained elevation of extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels observed in these mice. A pronounced GENENOTIN knockout-induced shortening of the immobility time in the TST (by ca 50%) compared to WT mice was not reduced any further by GENEIN-inhibiting ADs such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN, which is devoid of affinity for the GENEIN, exerted a significant reduction of immobility time in the GENENOTIN-/- mice. In the FST, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN administered acutely did not reduce any further the immobility time shortened by GENENOTIN knockout itself (ca 25%); however, antidepressant-like action of repeatedly (7 days) administered CHEMICALNOTIN was observed in GENENOTIN-/- mice, indicating that the chronic presence of this drug may also affect other neurochemical targets involved in the behavioral reactions monitored by this test. From the present study, it may be concluded that mice lacking the GENENOTIN may represent a good model of some aspects of depression-resistant behavior, paralleled with alterations in the expression of GENEIN, which result as an adaptation to elevated levels of extracellular CHEMICALIN.
16278927	In vitro inhibitory effects of non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drugs on CHEMICALNOTIN glucuronidation in recombinant GENEIN--potent inhibition by CHEMICALIN. The inhibitory potencies of non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on GENENOTIN activity were investigated in recombinant GENENOTIN using CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) as a substrate for glucuronidation. CHEMICALNOTIN glucuronidation (4-MUG) showed Michaelis-Menten kinetics with a Km value of 6.7 microM. The inhibitory effects of the following seven NSAIDs were investigated: CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN had the most potent inhibitory effect on 4-MUG with an IC50 value of 0.0341 microM. The IC50 values of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were 1.31, 24.2, and 34.1 microM, respectively, while CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN showed less potent inhibition. CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN inhibited 4-MUG competitively with Ki values of 0.0275, 0.710, 53.3 and 69.9 microM, respectively, being similar to each IC50 value. In conclusion, of the seven NSAIDs investigated, CHEMICALIN was the most potent inhibitor of recombinant GENEIN via 4-MUG in a competitive manner.
9669506	Affinities of CHEMICALNOTIN and various reuptake inhibitors for the GENENOTIN. In vitro radioligand binding studies were carried out in rat brain membranes to assess the affinity of various reuptake inhibitors for the GENENOTIN using the selective ligands CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively. The selective CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitors CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN displayed a high affinity for the GENEIN, whereas the CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor CHEMICALIN had a high affinity for the GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, a dual CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor, displayed a high affinity for both the GENENOTIN. Interestingly, CHEMICALIN, a dual CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake inhibitor, displayed only a moderate affinity for the GENEIN (Ki = 74 nM) and a very low affinity for the GENEIN (Ki = 1.26 microM). The relatively low affinities of CHEMICALNOTIN contrast with its potent in vivo CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake blocking properties. These results raise the possibility that the in vivo effects on the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN reuptake observed with CHEMICALNOTIN may not be mediated solely by its binding to the CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN binding sites.
17334708	Xanthurenic aciduria due to a mutation in GENENOTIN encoding GENENOTIN. Massive urinary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, known as xanthurenic aciduria or hydroxykynureninuria, in a young Somali boy suggested GENENOTIN deficiency. Mutation analysis of GENENOTIN encoding GENEIN of the index case revealed homozygosity for a c.593 GENENOTIN substitution leading to a CHEMICALIN-to-CHEMICALIN (GENENOTIN) shift. A younger brother was found to have a similar excretion pattern and the same genotype. At present, neither of the two boys has symptoms of niacin deficiency. This is the first report linking xanthurenic aciduria to a mutation in the gene encoding GENENOTIN.
16305240	CHEMICALIN bond activation in GENEIN by stabilization of the post-homolysis product CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN. Despite decades of research, the mechanism by which CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN)-dependent enzymes promote homolytic cleavage of the cofactor's CHEMICALNOTIN bond to initiate catalysis has continued to elude researchers. In this work, we utilized magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy to explore how the electronic structure of the reduced B12 cofactor (i.e., the post-homolysis product CHEMICALIN) is modulated by the enzyme GENEIN. Our data reveal a fairly uniform stabilization of the Co 3d orbitals relative to the corrin pi/pi*-based molecular orbitals when CHEMICALNOTIN is bound to the enzyme active site, particularly in the presence of substrate. Contrastingly, our previous studies (Brooks, A. J.; Vlasie, M.; Banerjee, R.; Brunold, T. C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2004, 126, 8167-8180.) showed that when CHEMICALIN is bound to the GENEIN active site, no enzymatic perturbation of the CHEMICALNOTIN electronic structure occurs, even in the presence of substrate (analogues). Collectively, these observations provide direct evidence that enzymatic CHEMICALNOTIN bond activation involves stabilization of the post-homolysis product, CHEMICALNOTIN, rather than destabilization of the CHEMICALNOTIN "ground" state.
23194825	Neurotoxicity of "CHEMICALNOTIN" and its metabolites in human dopaminergic differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. "CHEMICALNOTIN" (CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN) is a widely abused recreational drug, reported to produce neurotoxic effects, both in laboratory animals and in humans. CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites can be major contributors for CHEMICALNOTIN neurotoxicity. This work studied the neurotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN and its CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in human dopaminergic SH-SY5Y cells differentiated with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Differentiation led to SH-SY5Y neurons with higher ability to accumulate CHEMICALNOTIN and higher resistance towards CHEMICALNOTIN neurotoxicity. CHEMICALIN CHEMICALIN metabolites were neurotoxic to SH-SY5Y neurons, leading to GENEIN-independent cell death in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. CHEMICALNOTIN did not show a concentration- and time-dependent death. Pre-treatment with the antioxidant and CHEMICALNOTIN precursor, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), resulted in strong protection against the CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites' neurotoxicity. Neither the CHEMICALNOTIN radical scavenger, tiron, nor the inhibitor of the GENEIN, CHEMICALIN, prevented the metabolites' toxicity. Cells exposed to CHEMICALIN showed an increase in intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels, which, at the 48 h time-point, was not dependent in the activity increase of GENEIN (GENEIN), revealing a possible transient effect. Importantly, pre-treatment with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), an inhibitor of GENEIN, prevented CHEMICALNOTIN induced increase in CHEMICALNOTIN levels, but did not augment this metabolite cytotoxicity. Even so, CHEMICALNOTIN pre-treatment abolished CHEMICALNOTIN protective effects against CHEMICALNOTIN neurotoxicity, which were, at least partially, due to CHEMICALNOTIN de novo synthesis. Inversely, pre-treatment of cells with CHEMICALNOTIN augmented CHEMICALNOTIN-induced neurotoxicity, but only slightly affected CHEMICALNOTIN neuroprotection. In conclusion, CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites promote differential toxic effects to differentiated dopaminergic human SH-SY5Y cells.
23620436	A New Proposed Rodent Model of Chemically Induced Prostate Carcinogenesis: Distinct Time-Course Prostate Cancer Progression in the Dorsolateral and Ventral Lobes. BACKGROUND: Characterization of novel rodent models for prostate cancer studies requires evaluation of either spontaneous and carcinogen-induced tumors as well as tumor incidence in different prostatic lobes. We propose a new short-term rodent model of chemically induced prostate carcinogenesis in which prostate cancer progression occurs differentially in the dorsolateral and ventral lobes. METHODS: Adult gerbils were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN alone or associated with CHEMICALNOTIN for 3 or 6 months of treatment. Tumor incidence, latency, localization, and immunohistochemistry (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN) were studied in both lobes. RESULTS: Comparisons between both lobes revealed that lesions developed first in the DL while the VL presented longer tumor latency. However, after 6 months, there was a dramatic increase in tumor multiplicity in the VL, mainly in CHEMICALNOTIN-treated groups. Lesions clearly progressed from a premalignant to a malignant phenotype over time and tumor latency was decreased by CHEMICALNOTINâ+âCHEMICALNOTIN administration. Three-dimensional reconstruction of the prostatic complex showed that the DL developed tumors exclusively in the periurethral area and showed intense GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN immunostaining. Moreover, VL lesions emerged throughout the entire lobe. CHEMICALIN-induced lesions presented markers indicative of an aggressive phenotype: lack of basal cells, rupture of the smooth muscle cell layer, loss of GENEIN, and high GENEIN staining. CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct pathways involved in tumor progression in gerbil prostate lobes. This animal provides a good model for prostate cancer since it allows the investigation of advanced steps of carcinogenesis with shorter latency periods in both lobes.

22301814	Green tea extract alleviates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced biochemical toxicity and lipid peroxidation in rats. The present work was undertaken to evaluate the protective effect of an aqueous extract of green tea (GT, Camellia sinensis) leaves against CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced biochemical toxicity and lipid peroxidation production in experimental rats. The treatment with CHEMICALIN exhibited a significant increase in some serum hepatic and renal biochemical parameters (GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, total protein, GENEIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN). But the co-administration of GT has increased the level of plasmatic concentration of biochemical parameters. Exposure of rats to CHEMICALNOTIN caused also a significant increase in liver, kidney and testicular CHEMICALNOTIN reactive substances compared to control. However, the co-administration of GT was effective in reducing its level. To conclude, our data suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN exposure enhanced an oxidative stress by disturbing the tissue antioxidant defense system, but the GT co-administration alleviates the toxicity induced by CHEMICALNOTIN exposure.
15357957	Synthesis, receptor binding and functional studies of mesoridazine stereoisomers. The four stereoisomers of mesoridazine were synthesized and evaluated in D2, 5-HT1A, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, D1, and D3 receptor binding and functional assays. Two isomers demonstrated potent D2 receptor binding (Ki < 3 nM) and functional antagonism (IC50 < or = 10 nM) activities. These two isomers also showed moderate affinity for the 5-HT2A and D3 receptors. A third isomer was devoid of significant D2 receptor binding, but did have moderate affinity for the 5-HT2A and D3 receptors. The fourth isomer demonstrated poor affinity for all the receptors tested. Most significantly, the stereochemistry of the sulfoxide moiety played a dominant role in the observed structure-activity relationship (SAR).
23337256	Sex differences in the antidepressant-like effects of CHEMICALNOTIN. Current medications for major depression suffer from numerous limitations. Once the right drug for treatment has been determined, it still takes several weeks for it to take effect and improve mood. This time lag is a serious concern for the healthcare community when dealing with patients with suicidal thoughts. However, recent clinical studies have shown that a single low-dose injection of CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN (GENEIN) antagonist, has rapid antidepressant effects that are observed within hours and are long lasting. Although major depression affects twice as many women as men, all studies examining the rapid antidepressant effects of CHEMICALNOTIN have focused on male subjects. Thus, we have investigated the behavioral and molecular effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in both male and female rats and demonstrated greater sensitivity in female rats at a low dose of CHEMICALNOTIN, a dose does not have antidepressant-like effects in male rats. The antidepressant-like effects of this low dose of CHEMICALNOTIN were completely abolished when female rats were ovariectomized (OVX), and restored when physiological levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were supplemented, suggesting a critical role for gonadal hormones in enhancing the antidepressant-like effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in female rats. In preclinical studies, the GENEIN (GENEIN) in the medial prefrontal cortex and the GENEIN (GENEIN) in the hippocampus have been proposed as critical mediators of CHEMICALIN's rapid antidepressant actions. In our hands, the increased sensitivity of female rats to a low dose of CHEMICALNOTIN was not mediated through phosphorylation of GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN.
23574017	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cholestasis on the pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN in rats: reduced biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN. Abstract 1. Since the prevalent hormonal combination therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN analogues in cancer patients has frequency and possibility to induce the cholestasis, the frequent combination therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN (EE, an oral contraceptive) and CHEMICALNOTIN (an anticancer drug) might be monitored in aspect of efficacy and safety. CHEMICALIN is mainly excreted into the bile via GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN) in hepatobiliary route and metabolized via GENEIN subfamily. Also the hepatic GENENOTIN (not GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN subfamily levels were reduced in EE-induced cholestatic (EEC) rats. Thus, we herein report the pharmacokinetic changes of CHEMICALNOTIN with respect to the changes in its biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in EEC rats. 2. The pharmacokinetic study of CHEMICALNOTIN after intravenous administration of its CHEMICALNOTIN was conducted along with the investigation of bile flow rate and hepatobiliary excretion of CHEMICALNOTIN in control and EEC rats. 3. The significantly greater AUC (58.7% increase) of CHEMICALNOTIN in EEC rats was due to the slower CL (32.9% decrease). The slower CL was due to the reduction of hepatic biliary excretion (67.0% decrease) and hepatic GENEIN subfamily-mediated metabolism (21.9% decrease) of CHEMICALIN. These results might have broader implications to understand the altered pharmacokinetics and/or pharmacologic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN via biliary excretion and hepatic metabolism in experimental and clinical CHEMICALNOTIN-induced cholestasis.
16534240	Corticotropin-releasing hormone reduces pressure pain sensitivity in humans without involvement of beta-endorphin(1-31), but does not reduce heat pain sensitivity. In the present study the effects of intravenously administered corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) on the release of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) derivatives such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), beta-lipotropin (beta-LPH) and beta-endorphin (beta-END) as well as direct effects of CRH on pain sensitivity were examined. In 16 healthy volunteers we studied the effects of 100 microg intravenously administered CRH in absence or presence of 12 mg naloxone on heat or pressure pain sensitivity, using a double-blind, cross-over and placebo-controlled design. To evaluate analgesic effects of CRH via release of POMC derivatives, we determined plasma concentrations of beta-END-immunoreactive material (IRM), authentic beta-END (beta-END(1-31)) and beta-LPH IRM, in parallel with heat and pressure pain tolerance thresholds before and 15 and 30 min after treatment with CRH (or placebo), and 5 min after naloxone (or placebo) administration which was administered 40 min after CRH (or placebo) injection. CRH increased levels of beta-END IRM, beta-END(1-31) and beta-LPH IRM. As compared to beta-END IRM levels measured by a commercial RIA kit, the beta-END(1-31) levels determined by a highly specific two-site RIA, proved to be remarkably small. Furthermore, CRH did not induce increases of heat pain tolerance thresholds, but of pressure pain tolerance thresholds, which, however, were not reversible by naloxone. Neither beta-END nor beta-LPH IRM nor beta-END(1-31) levels correlated with heat or pressure pain tolerance thresholds. We conclude that CRH does not modulate heat, but pressure pain; POMC derivatives like beta-END IRM, beta-END(1-31) or beta-LPH do not mediate this effect.
23325562	Activation of GENEIN and Phosphorylation of GENEIN Mediate CHEMICALIN Induced Apoptosis in HepG2 Liver Cancer Cells. Despite the antitumour effect of CHEMICALNOTIN observed in several cancers, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Thus, in the present study, the roles of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were examined in ursolic acid induced apoptosis in HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. CHEMICALNOTIN significantly exerted cytotoxicity, increased the sub-G1 population and the number of CHEMICALNOTIN homodimer and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase(TdT) mediated CHEMICALNOTIN nick end labeling positive cells in HepG2 cells. Also, ursolic acid enhanced the cleavages of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN, attenuated the expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN in HepG2 cells. Interestingly, CHEMICALIN increased the phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN and also enhanced phosphorylation of GENEIN at inactive form CHEMICALIN 9, whereas CHEMICALIN attenuated the phosphorylation of GENEIN and GENEIN in HepG2 cells. Conversely, GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN or GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN blocked the cleavages of GENEIN and GENEIN induced by CHEMICALIN in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, proteosomal inhibitor CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN activation, GENEIN phosphorylation, cleaved GENEIN and deceased GENEIN induced by CHEMICALIN in HepG2 cells. Overall, our findings suggest that CHEMICALIN induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells via GENEIN activation and GENEIN phosphorylation as a potent chemopreventive agent.

23046524	Adverse outcome pathways during zebrafish embryogenesis: a case study with CHEMICALNOTIN. Using CHEMICALIN as a reference GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, the objective of this study was to develop an adverse outcome pathway (AOP) that provided quantitative linkages across levels of biological organization during zebrafish embryogenesis. Within normal zebrafish embryos, we first demonstrated that GENENOTIN transcripts and GENENOTIN activity increased in a stage-dependent manner following segmentation. We then showed that static exposure of embryos to CHEMICALIN (31.2-500 nM) from 5 to 96 hpf resulted in significant stage- and concentration-dependent GENEIN inhibition, albeit these effects were fully reversible within 48 h following transfer to clean water. However, even in the presence of significant GENEIN inhibition, exposure to non-teratogenic CHEMICALIN concentrations (â¤250 nM) did not adversely impact secondary motoneuron development at 96 hpf. Therefore, we investigated the potential effects of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure on spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - an early locomotor behavior that results from innervation of primary (not secondary) motoneuron axons to target axial muscles. Based on these studies, the frequency of spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf - a developmental stage with minimal GENEIN expression and activity - was significantly higher following exposure to CHEMICALIN concentrations as low as 31.2 nM. Overall, our data suggest that (1) normal GENENOTIN activity is not required for secondary motoneuron development and (2) spontaneous tail contractions at 26 hpf are sensitive to CHEMICALIN exposure, an effect that may be independent of GENEIN inhibition. Using a well-studied reference chemical, this study highlights the potential challenges in developing quantitative AOPs to support chemical screening and prioritization strategies.
23344956	Depletion of molecular chaperones from the endoplasmic reticulum and fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus associated with pathogenesis in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Missense mutations in the proteolipid protein 1 (PLP1) gene cause a wide spectrum of hypomyelinating disorders, from mild spastic paraplegia type 2 to severe Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). Mutant PLP1 accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and induces ER stress. However, the link between the clinical severity of PMD and the cellular response induced by mutant PLP1 remains largely unknown. Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER generally leads to up-regulation of ER chaperones to alleviate ER stress. Here, we found that expression of the PLP1-A243V mutant, which causes severe disease, depletes some ER chaperones with a KDEL (Lys-Asp-Glu-Leu) motif, in HeLa cells, MO3.13 oligodendrocytic cells, and primary oligodendrocytes. The same PLP1 mutant also induces fragmentation of the Golgi apparatus (GA). These organelle changes are less prominent in cells with milder disease-associated PLP1 mutants. Similar changes are also observed in cells expressing another disease-causing gene that triggers ER stress, as well as in cells treated with brefeldin A, which induces ER stress and GA fragmentation by inhibiting GA to ER trafficking. We also found that mutant PLP1 disturbs localization of the KDEL receptor, which transports the chaperones with the KDEL motif from the GA to the ER. These data show that PLP1 mutants inhibit GA to ER trafficking, which reduces the supply of ER chaperones and induces GA fragmentation. We propose that depletion of ER chaperones and GA fragmentation induced by mutant misfolded proteins contribute to the pathogenesis of inherited ER stress-related diseases and affect the disease severity.
9040115	Endogenous opioid systems and CHEMICALNOTIN addiction. CHEMICALNOTIN exerts numerous pharmacological effects through its interaction with various neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Among the latter, the endogenous opioids play a key role in the rewarding (addictive) properties of CHEMICALNOTIN. Three types of GENENOTIN represent the respective targets of the major GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN, respectively). The rewarding (reinforcing) properties of GENENOTIN ligands are brought by activation of the mesolimbic dopamine system which ascends from the ventral tegmentum of the midbrain (VTA) to rostral structures; of these, the nucleus accumbens (NAC) is of particular importance in drug addiction. In contrast, dysphoria results from activation of GENENOTIN. The neurochemical manifestations of these opposing effects are, respectively, increases and decreases in CHEMICALNOTIN release in the NAC. Several lines of evidence indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN interferes with endogenous opioid mechanisms which are closely linked with CHEMICALNOTIN transmission in the mesolimbic pathway. The view that condensation products of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-derived CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) play a role remains controversial. There is, however, much information on the direct (acute and chronic) effects of CHEMICALIN on the binding properties of GENEIN, as well as modulation of GENEIN synthesis and secretion (e.g. a suggested increase in GENEIN release). In view of the reinforcing properties of CHEMICALNOTIN, it is relevant to consider behavioural studies involving CHEMICALNOTIN self-administration in rodents and primates. Low doses of morphine have been found to increase, and higher doses of the opiate to decrease, CHEMICALNOTIN consumption. Conversely, opioid antagonists such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (which bind to non-selectively GENEIN) have been shown to decrease CHEMICALNOTIN consumption under various experimental conditions. Similar results have been reported when selective GENENOTIN antagonists are administered. Results obtained in genetic models of high preference for CHEMICALNOTIN also support the view that alcohol intake depends on the activity of the endogenous opioid reward system and that CHEMICALNOTIN consumption may serve to compensate for inherent deficits in this system. One hypothetical model proposes that reward results from activation of GENENOTIN in the VTA and/or GENENOTIN in the NAC; both these nuclei are targets of endogenous GENENOTIN. It is suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN interferes with this reward pathway either directly or indirectly. The available experimental data accord well with those obtained from clinical studies which opioid antagonists have been used to prevent relapse in alcoholics. Conceptual considerations concerning communalities between various forms of addictions are also discussed in this review.
16690332	Dynamics of CHEMICALIN rebinding to the GENEIN from bacterial pathogens. Some Gram-positive bacterial pathogens harbor a gene that encodes a protein (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) with striking sequence identity to the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). However, they lack the GENENOTIN participating to the stability of an active dimer in the mammalian isoforms. The unique properties of GENENOTIN make it an excellent model system for probing how the heme environment tunes CHEMICALNOTIN dynamics and for comparing it to the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) using ultrafast transient spectroscopy. CHEMICALIN rebinding in GENEIN from Staphylococcus aureus (GENEIN) is faster than that measured for either Bacillus anthracis (GENEIN) or for GENEIN in both oxidized and reduced forms in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN. To test whether these distinct rates arise from different energy barriers for CHEMICALNOTIN recombination, we measured rebinding kinetics at several temperatures. Our data are consistent with different barriers for CHEMICALNOTIN recombination in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and the presence of a second CHEMICALNOTIN-binding site. The hypothesis that an additional CHEMICALNOTIN-binding cavity is present in GENENOTIN is also consistent with the effect of the CHEMICALNOTIN concentration on its rebinding. The lack of the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN concentration on the geminate rebinding in GENENOTIN could be due to an isolated second site. We confirm the existence of a second CHEMICALNOTIN site in the GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN as previously hypothesized [A. Slama-Schwok, M. Negrerie, V. Berka, J.C. Lambry, A.L. Tsai, M.H. Vos, J.L. Martin, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) traffic in GENENOTIN. Evidence for a new CHEMICALNOTIN binding site dependent on CHEMICALNOTIN? J. Biol. Chem. 277 (2002) 7581-7586]. This site requires the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN; and we propose that CHEMICALNOTIN dynamic and escape from GENENOTIN is regulated by the active site CHEMICALNOTIN-bonding network connecting between the heme, the substrate, and cofactor.
2568748	Nonthrombolytic intervention in acute myocardial infarction. Alternative interventions are available for patients in whom thrombolytic therapy is inappropriate after an acute myocardial infarction. Administration of a beta blocker within the first 24 hours of the patient's admission to the coronary care unit can reduce overall morbidity and mortality within the first 7 days by about 15%. Maintenance therapy with an oral beta blocker can reduce mortality within the succeeding 3 years by about 25%. CHEMICALIN, a unique cardioselective GENEIN blocker with a half-life of 9 minutes, can enable some patients with relative contraindications to beta blockers to nevertheless benefit from early beta-blocking therapy. It also is useful in screening patients for subsequent therapy with beta blockers. Those who tolerate the CHEMICALNOTIN infusion can be given a long-acting beta blocker. For patients who exhibit intolerance to CHEMICALNOTIN, the infusion can be terminated with rapid return to baseline hemodynamics.
23000249	GENENOTIN. Recent proteomic analyses of snake venoms show that GENENOTIN represent major components in most of the Crotalid and Viperid venoms. In this chapter we discuss the multiple activities of the GENENOTIN. In addition to hemorrhagic activity, members of the GENENOTIN family also have fibrin(ogen)olytic activity, act as GENENOTIN activators, activate blood GENENOTIN, possess apoptotic activity, inhibit platelet aggregation, are pro-inflammatory and inactivate blood GENENOTIN inhibitors. Clearly the GENENOTIN have multiple functions in addition to their well-known hemorrhagic activity. The realization that there are structural variations in the GENENOTIN and the early studies that led to their classification represents an important event in our understanding of the structural forms of the GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN were subdivided into the P-I, P-II and P-III protein classes. The noticeable characteristic that distinguished the different classes was their size (molecular weight) differences and domain structure: Class I (P-I), the small GENENOTIN, have molecular masses of 20-30Â kDa, contain only a GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN; Class II (P-II), the medium size GENENOTIN, molecular masses of 30-60Â kDa, contain the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN; Class III (P-III), the large GENENOTIN, have molecular masses of 60-100Â kDa, contain GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN structure. Another significant advance in the GENENOTIN field was the characterization of the crystal structure of the first GENENOTIN. The structures of other GENENOTIN soon followed and the structures of GENENOTIN have also been determined. The active site of the GENEIN has a consensus GENENOTIN sequence and a CHEMICALIN-turn. The "CHEMICALNOTIN-turn" structure contains a conserved CHEMICALNOTIN residue that forms a hydrophobic basement for the three CHEMICALNOTIN-binding CHEMICALNOTIN in the consensus sequence.
7929150	Catalytic properties of GENENOTIN. A cDNA encoding the GENENOTIN gene was isolated by reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction from BALB/c mouse liver mRNA. Vectors containing the full coding sequence as well as two different CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal truncated genes expressed enzymatically active protein in Escherichia coli. GENEIN produced by a vector containing the full coding sequence, which includes a possible CHEMICALIN-terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, was proteolytically processed by E. coli and contained several CHEMICALIN-terminal ends. The two CHEMICALIN-terminal truncated vectors deleted, respectively, 1) the 29-CHEMICALIN putative targeting sequence and 2) 51 CHEMICALIN, yielding a protein equivalent to a GENEIN isolated from mouse liver mitochondria; and both vectors produced homogeneous protein fractions. These latter two forms of GENENOTIN had identical steady-state constants for the hydration of CHEMICALNOTIN, with maximal values of kcat/Km at 3 x 10(7) M-1 s-1 and kcat at 3 x 10(5) s-1 with an apparent pKa for catalysis of 7.4 determined from kcat/Km. In catalytic properties, GENENOTIN is closest to GENENOTIN; however, in inhibition by CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, GENEIN is very similar to GENEIN. GENENOTIN has a tyrosine at position 64, where the highly active isozyme II has CHEMICALNOTIN serving as a proton shuttle in the catalytic pathway. Investigation of a site-specific mutant of GENEIN containing the replacement GENENOTIN showed that the unique kinetic properties of GENEIN are not due to the presence of CHEMICALIN at position 64.
17929831	Kinetic characterization of GENENOTIN from the thermophilic archaea Methanocaldococcus jannaschii. GENEIN (GENEIN) catalyzes the CHEMICALIN dependent condensation of a molecule of IMP with CHEMICALNOTIN to form CHEMICALIN, in a reaction driven by the hydrolysis of CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN. GENEIN from the thermophilic archaea, Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (GENEIN) is 345 CHEMICALIN long against an average length of 430-457 CHEMICALIN for most mesophilic GENEIN. This short GENEIN has two large deletions that map to the middle and CHEMICALIN-terminus of the protein. This article discusses the detailed kinetic characterization of GENENOTIN. Initial velocity and product inhibition studies, carried out at 70 degrees C, suggest a rapid equilibrium random AB steady-state ordered C kinetic mechanism for the GENENOTIN catalyzed reaction. GENENOTIN are known to exhibit monomer-dimer equilibrium with the dimer being implicated in catalysis. In contrast, our studies show that GENENOTIN is an equilibrium mixture of dimers and tetramers with the tetramer being the catalytically active form. The tetramer dissociates into dimers with a minor increase in ionic strength of the buffer, while the dimer is extremely stable and does not dissociate even at 1.2 M CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN, a product of the reaction, was found to be a potent inhibitor of GENEIN showing biphasic inhibition of enzyme activity. The inhibition was competitive with IMP and noncompetitive with CHEMICALNOTIN. GENENOTIN, like the GENENOTIN, exhibits substrate inhibition, with IMP inhibiting enzyme activity at subsaturating CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations. Regulation of enzyme activity by the glycolytic intermediate, CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, was also observed with the inhibition being competitive with IMP and noncompetitive against CHEMICALNOTIN.
8052854	Inhibition of GENENOTIN by sodium salicylate and aspirin. The transcription factor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is critical for the inducible expression of multiple cellular and viral genes involved in inflammation and infection including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN, and adhesion molecules. The anti-inflammatory drugs CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibited the activation of GENEIN, which further explains the mechanism of action of these drugs. This inhibition prevented the degradation of the GENENOTIN inhibitor, GENENOTIN, and therefore GENENOTIN was retained in the cytosol. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN also inhibited GENEIN-dependent transcription from the GENEIN enhancer and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) long terminal repeat (LTR) in transfected T cells.
16417577	GENENOTIN attenuates GENEIN (GENEIN) phosphorylation induced by chronic CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN challenge in Cath.a cells and primary striatal cultures. Repeated CHEMICALNOTIN administration leads to molecular alterations of the neural circuitry in the locus coeruleus and nucleus accumbens. These changes include increased activity of several components of the CHEMICALNOTIN signaling pathway that are thought to be associated with psychological and somatic signs of opiate withdrawal. The neuropeptide GENENOTIN has been shown to attenuate CHEMICALNOTIN signaling in multiple cell types. The current study demonstrates that acute GENENOTIN treatment blocks the consequences of increased CHEMICALNOTIN signaling following chronic opiate administration and withdrawal in Cath.a cells and primary cultures of striatal neurons as measured by phosphorylation of the transcription factor GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). In addition, GENENOTIN-mediated attenuation of GENENOTIN phosphorylation is independent of GENENOTIN-induced GENENOTIN phosphorylation in Cath.a cells. These data suggest that GENENOTIN may serve as an additional potential therapeutic target for the treatment of opiate withdrawal.
17896959	CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN exchange inhibitors: a new class of CHEMICALNOTIN regulators. The GENEIN (GENENOTIN) is a bidirectional transporter that normally extrudes CHEMICALIN from the cell (forward mode), but also brings CHEMICALIN into the cell (reverse mode) under special conditions such as intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN(i)) accumulation or membrane depolarization. There are three GENENOTIN isoforms: GENENOTIN is widely expressed in the heart, kidney, brain, blood vessels, and so on; whereas the expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN is limited mainly to the brain and skeletal muscle. The pharmacology of GENENOTIN inhibitors has been studied extensively since the development of CHEMICALIN, a prototype CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitor, in 1996. Currently, experiments are actively progressing with more selective inhibitors: CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. Intriguingly, the inhibitory potency of CHEMICALIN GENEIN inhibitors is directly coupled to the rate of CHEMICALNOTIN(i)-dependent inactivation. Therefore, the CHEMICALNOTIN inhibitors are apparently dormant during the forward mode under normal conditions (low CHEMICALNOTIN(i)), but become effective during the reverse mode under pathological conditions (high CHEMICALNOTIN(i)). This should be an ideal profile for CHEMICALNOTIN regulators against CHEMICALNOTIN(i)-related diseases, such as ischemia/reperfusion injuries, salt-dependent hypertension, and digitalis arrhythmia. Existing GENEIN blockers, such as CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN, have been found to have an GENEIN inhibitory action. It is possible that this property is partly responsible for their antiarrhythmic and cardioprotective effects. This article presents the characteristics of selective and non-selective GENENOTIN inhibitors and their therapeutic potential as a new CHEMICALNOTIN regulator.
17593236	Efficacy and safety of the GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus inadequately controlled on CHEMICALNOTIN alone or on CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. AIM: To assess the efficacy and safety of a 24-week treatment with CHEMICALIN, a highly selective once-daily oral GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control [GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) >or=7.5% and <or=10.5%] while on glimepiride alone or in combination with metformin. METHODS: After a screening, diet/exercise run-in and drug wash-off period, a glimepiride +/- metformin dose titration/stabilization period and a 2-week, single-blind placebo run-in, 441 patients (of ages 18-75 years) were randomized to receive the addition of sitagliptin 100 mg once daily or placebo in a 1 : 1 ratio for 24 weeks. Of these patients, 212 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) monotherapy and 229 were on glimepiride (>or=4 mg/day) plus metformin (>or=1,500 mg/day) combination therapy. Patients exceeding pre-specified glycaemic thresholds during the double-blind treatment period were provided open-label rescue therapy (pioglitazone) until study end. The primary efficacy analysis evaluated the change in HbA(1c) from baseline to Week 24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2-h post-meal glucose and lipid measurements. RESULTS: Mean baseline HbA(1c) was 8.34% in the sitagliptin and placebo groups. After 24 weeks, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.74% (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. In the subset of patients on glimepiride plus metformin, sitagliptin reduced HbA(1c) by 0.89% relative to placebo, compared with a reduction of 0.57% in the subset of patients on glimepiride alone. The addition of sitagliptin reduced FPG by 20.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) and increased homeostasis model assessment-beta, a marker of beta-cell function, by 12% (p < 0.05) relative to placebo. In patients who underwent a meal tolerance test (n = 134), sitagliptin decreased 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) by 36.1 mg/dl (p < 0.001) relative to placebo. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, although there was a higher incidence of overall (60 vs. 47%) and drug-related adverse experiences (AEs) (15 vs. 7%) in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. This was largely because of a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia AEs (12 vs. 2%, respectively) in the sitagliptin group compared with the placebo group. Body weight modestly increased with sitagliptin relative to placebo (+0.8 vs. -0.4 kg; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin 100 mg once daily significantly improved glycaemic control and beta-cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with glimepiride or glimepiride plus metformin therapy. The addition of sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with a modest increase in hypoglycaemia and body weight, consistent with glimepiride therapy and the observed degree of glycaemic improvement.

23160090	CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammatory signal transduction in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is an active ingredient obtained from the flower of Carthamus tinctorius L. The present study investigated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory signal transduction in human alveolar epithelial A549 cells. A549 cells stimulated with LPS were incubated with three doses of CHEMICALNOTIN (1, 4 and 16Î¼mol/L). CHEMICALIN suppressed the expression of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN at the mRNA and protein level, and inhibited the adhesion of leukocytes to A549 cells. CHEMICALIN treatment also decreased GENEIN GENEIN nuclear translocation and inhibited the phosphorylation of GENEIN GENEIN (GENEIN GENEIN). These findings suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN effectively inhibits LPS-induced inflammatory signal transduction in A549 cells.
23601990	Synthesis and biological evaluation of CHEMICALIN as potent and selective inhibitors of GENEIN. A series of CHEMICALIN were synthesized and investigated inÂ vitro as inhibitors of pancreatic GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN). The results showed that most of the synthesized compounds exhibited nanomolar potency against GENEIN, much better than the parent CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, these CHEMICALIN demonstrated good to high selectivity for GENEIN over GENEIN, which only showed micromolar potency inhibition of GENEIN. The most selective and potent inhibitor of GENENOTIN (3e) had IC50 value of 0.72Â nM and 11800-fold selectivity for GENENOTIN over GENENOTIN. The structure-activity relationships revealed that the free CHEMICALIN group at position 5 and CHEMICALIN group at position 7 of the CHEMICALIN are favorable to the inhibition of GENEIN. The inhibition mechanism and kinetic characterization studies indicated that they are irreversible competitive inhibitors of GENENOTIN.
16855178	CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a CHEMICALNOTIN-releasing derivative of CHEMICALNOTIN, exerts antinociceptive effects in a model of postinflammatory hypersensitivity. CHEMICALNOTIN functions as a neuromodulator and exerts anti-inflammatory activities. Recent data indicate that irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is linked to inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. In this study, we have investigated the role of a novel CHEMICALNOTIN-releasing derivative of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) in modulating nociception to colorectal distension (CRD), a model that mimics some features of IBS, in healthy and postcolitic rats. Four graded (0.4-1.6 ml of water) CRDs were produced in conscious rats, and colorectal sensitivity and pain were assessed by measuring the abdominal withdrawal response and spinal GENENOTIN expression. In healthy rats, CHEMICALIN dose dependently (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg) attenuated CRD-induced hypersensitivity and significantly inhibited CRD-induced overexpression of spinal GENEIN mRNA, whereas CHEMICALIN had no effect. CHEMICALNOTIN-induced antinociception was reversed by CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN inhibitor. The antinociceptive effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was maintained in a rodent model of postinflammatory hypersensitivity (4 weeks after colitis induction). At a dose of 100 mg/kg, CHEMICALNOTIN reversed the allodynic response caused by CRD in postcolitic rats. Colonic GENEIN and GENEIN mRNA and spinal GENEIN mRNA expression were significantly down-regulated by CHEMICALIN, but not by CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN, increased blood concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN in both healthy and postcolitic rats. Taken together, these data suggest that CHEMICALIN inhibits hypersensitivity induced by CRD in both healthy and postcolitic, allodynic rats by a GENEIN-mediated mechanism. This study provides evidence that CHEMICALNOTIN-releasing drugs might have beneficial effects in the treatment of painful intestinal disorders.
15066664	Block of GENEIN GENEIN by novel CHEMICALIN analogues of CHEMICALIN. GENEIN are a critical component of electrically excitable cells. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) is an established GENEIN blocker and is a useful anticonvulsant and class 1b antiarrhythmic, and has been effectively used in the treatment of neuropathic pain. In this study, we have synthesized novel CHEMICALIN analogues of CHEMICALIN and examined their ability to inhibit GENEIN GENEIN expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells. CHEMICALNOTIN ring substitutions were examined including CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. We have found that CHEMICALNOTIN ring substitutions with electron withdrawing properties resulted in compounds with greater activity. In comparison to CHEMICALIN, the novel CHEMICALIN-substituted CHEMICALIN compounds produced as much as a 20-fold greater tonic and frequency-dependent blockade of GENEIN channels with an IC(50) value of 14.5 microM. In addition, the CHEMICALNOTIN-substitutions have position specific state dependent blocking properties. The CHEMICALNOTIN substitutions have an 8-, 13- and 3-fold increased affinity for the inactivated state, respectively. Molecular modeling suggests that these differences in affinity are due to a direct interaction with the receptor. Comparing models of CHEMICALNOTIN to the novel CHEMICALNOTIN compound suggests that the increased activity may be due to an optimized CHEMICALNOTIN ring position and increased molecular volume. This information may be useful in the development of more potent GENEIN blockers.
11034583	Effects of a GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN on gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in humans. BACKGROUND: GENEIN are located on enteric cholinergic neurones and may regulate peristalsis. GENENOTIN receptors on primary afferent neurones have been postulated to modulate visceral sensation. While GENENOTIN agonists are used as prokinetic agents, the physiological role of GENENOTIN receptors in the human gut is unknown. AIMS: Our aim was to characterise the role of GENENOTIN receptors in regulating gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in healthy subjects under baseline and stimulated conditions with a GENENOTIN receptor antagonist. METHODS: Part A compared the effects of placebo to four doses of a GENEIN receptor antagonist (CHEMICALIN) on the CHEMICALIN mediated increase in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN (a GENEIN mediated response) and orocaecal transit in 18 subjects. In part B, 52 healthy subjects received placebo, or 0.05, 0.5, or 5 mg of CHEMICALNOTIN for 10-12 days; gastric, small bowel, and colonic transit were measured by scintigraphy on days 7-9, and fasting and postprandial colonic motor function, compliance, and sensation during distensions were assessed on day 12. RESULTS: Part A: 0.5, 5, and 20 mg doses of CHEMICALNOTIN had significant and quantitatively similar effects, antagonising the cisapride mediated increase in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN and acceleration of orocaecal transit. Part B: CHEMICALNOTIN tended to delay colonic transit (geometric centre of isotope at 24 (p=0.06) and 48 hours (p=0.08)), but did not have dose related effects on transit, fasting or postprandial colonic motor activity, compliance, or sensation. CONCLUSION: GENEIN receptors are involved in the regulation of CHEMICALIN stimulated orocaecal transit; CHEMICALNOTIN tends to modulate colonic transit but not sensory functions or compliance in healthy human subjects.
16455797	Structures of wild-type and mutant GENENOTIN, a potential therapeutic drug target. GENEIN (GENENOTIN) is a key enzyme in the control of CHEMICALIN levels in human cells, as acetylation of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN triggers export or degradation. Increased intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN levels accompany several types of cancers as well as other human diseases, and compounds that affect the expression, activity, or stability of GENENOTIN are being explored as potential therapeutic drugs. We have expressed GENENOTIN from the cloned cDNA in Escherichia coli and have determined high-resolution structures of wild-type and mutant GENENOTIN, as the free dimer and in binary and ternary complexes with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN, and the inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN (BE-3-3-3). These structures show details of binding sites for cofactor, substrates, and inhibitor and provide a framework to understand enzymatic activity, mutations, and the action of potential drugs. Two dimer conformations were observed: a symmetric form with two open surface channels capable of binding substrate or cofactor, and an asymmetric form in which only one of the surface channels appears capable of binding and acetylating CHEMICALNOTIN. GENEIN was found to self-CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALIN-26 in the presence of CHEMICALNOTIN and absence of substrate, a reaction apparently catalzyed by CHEMICALNOTIN bound in the second channel of the asymmetric dimer. These unexpected and intriguing complexities seem likely to have some as yet undefined role in regulating GENEIN activity or stability as a part of CHEMICALIN homeostasis. Sequence signatures group GENENOTIN with proteins that appear to have GENENOTIN activity.
23570914	Suppression of GENENOTIN via GENENOTIN contributes to CHEMICALNOTIN-induced oxidative stress and fibrogenesis. Pulmonary fibrosis is a serious and irreversible lung injury with obscure etiologic mechanisms and no effective treatment to date. This study explored a crucial link between oxidative stress and pulmonary fibrogenesis, focusing on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a core transcription factor in antioxidative regulation systems. Treatment of C57 BL/6 mice with CHEMICALIN increased fibroblast viability and GENEIN production and significantly downregulated GENEIN. In addition, prominent oxidative stress was indicated by changes in GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN activity, and CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-reactive substance levels. In a cell-based model, CHEMICALIN suppressed GENEIN activation via GENEIN phosphorylation, enhancing intracellular reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species in lung fibroblasts and stimulating abnormal cell proliferation and collagen secretion. To confirm this novel mechanism of CHEMICALIN-induced fibrogenesis, we attempted to upregulate GENEIN and related antioxidant proteins in bleomycin-treated fibroblasts using a putative GENEIN activator, CHEMICALIN, and the results showed that CHEMICALNOTIN-induced fibroblast proliferation and GENENOTIN content were attenuated through improved redox balance. Collectively, these results disclose a potential regulatory mechanism in pulmonary fibrosis that will aid the development of new therapies.
23298863	Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling of GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN for the inhibition of GENEIN messenger RNA expression and antitumor efficacy in xenografted tumor model mice. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALIN) is a potent, selective GENEIN signaling pathway inhibitor that binds to GENEIN and is being developed for the treatment of cancer. The objectives of these studies were to explore the possibility of establishing of a link between the pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN and the responses of GENENOTIN mRNA in tumor-associated stromal or skin cells and the antitumor effect of GENENOTIN inhibition. To this end, we built pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic models that describe the relationship of the concentrations of CHEMICALIN plasma to the responses of GENEIN mRNA in the tumor (target) and skin (surrogate) and to tumor growth inhibition in mice bearing xenografts of human pancreatic tumors (PAN-04). The responses of GENENOTIN mRNA and tumor growth were described by an indirect response model and an exponential tumor growth model, respectively. The IC50 values for GENEIN mRNA inhibition in the tumor and skin by CHEMICALIN were estimated to be 0.0457 and 0.113 Î¼g/ml, respectively. The IC90 value for tumor growth inhibition was estimated to be 0.68 Î¼g/ml. These results suggest that a >83% inhibition of GENENOTIN mRNA expression in the skin or a >94% inhibition of GENENOTIN mRNA expression in the tumor would be required to sufficiently inhibit (>90%) GENENOTIN-related tumor growth in the xenografted model mice. We conclude that GENENOTIN mRNA expression in the tumor and skin could be a useful biomarker for predicting the antitumor effect of GENENOTIN inhibitors.
10626810	Synergistic effects of new chemopreventive agents and conventional cytotoxic agents against human lung cancer cell lines. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells have constitutively high expression of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN. These NSCLC cells also have increased CHEMICALNOTIN expression (CHEMICALNOTIN). Many lung cancers also express GENENOTIN RNA and GENENOTIN protein and biosynthesize CHEMICALNOTIN, which correlates with their metastatic potential. Several studies have demonstrated that GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitors could inhibit the in vitro growth of human lung cancer cell lines. In this report, we evaluated the growth-inhibitory effects of CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN and GENEIN inhibitor; CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a novel proapoptotic agent that does not inhibit GENEIN enzymes; and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a GENEIN inhibitor on human lung cancer cell lines. We compared these effects with those of CHEMICALNOTIN, a chemoprevention agent, and with the cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, alone or in combination. Our goal was to develop new chemoprevention and treatment strategies. Each of the six agents tested inhibited the in vitro growth of three NSCLC and three SCLC cell lines at the highest concentration. CHEMICALNOTIN was the most potent agent (IC50 = 0.003-0.150 microM); CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN had intermediate potency (IC50 = 4-80 microM), and CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were the least potent (IC50 = 150-500 microM). Combination studies showed synergistic interactions for CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, regardless of drug-resistance phenotype. At high concentrations, the combination of CHEMICALNOTIN and each of the five other drugs resulted in a strong synergistic effect. These studies provide a rationale for chemoprevention (CHEMICALNOTIN +/- CHEMICALNOTIN +/- CHEMICALNOTIN) and therapeutic (CHEMICALNOTIN +/- CHEMICALNOTIN +/- CHEMICALNOTIN) studies in patients at risk for, or with, lung cancer.
20421509	CHEMICALIN inhibit GENEIN function by inducing protein oligomerization. GENENOTIN, a member of the GENENOTIN family of CHEMICALNOTIN-binding proteins, regulates carcinoma cell motility via interactions with GENENOTIN. Numerous studies indicate that GENENOTIN is not simply a marker for metastatic disease, but rather has a direct role in metastatic progression. These observations suggest that GENENOTIN is an excellent target for therapeutic intervention. Using a unique biosensor-based assay, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) was identified as an inhibitor that disrupts the GENEIN/GENEIN interaction. To examine the interaction of GENEIN with CHEMICALIN, we determined the 2.3 A crystal structure of human CHEMICALNOTIN-GENEIN bound to CHEMICALIN. Two CHEMICALIN molecules bind within the hydrophobic target binding pocket of CHEMICALNOTIN-GENEIN with no significant conformational changes observed in the protein upon complex formation. NMR chemical shift perturbations are consistent with the crystal structure and demonstrate that CHEMICALIN binds to the target binding cleft of GENEIN in solution. Remarkably, CHEMICALIN binding results in the assembly of five CHEMICALNOTIN-GENEIN/TFP dimers into a tightly packed pentameric ring. Within each pentamer most of the contacts between GENEIN dimers occurs through the CHEMICALIN moieties. The CHEMICALNOTIN-GENEIN/CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) complex exhibits a similar pentameric assembly. Equilibrium sedimentation and cross-linking studies demonstrate the cooperative formation of a similarly sized GENEIN/CHEMICALIN oligomer in solution. Assays examining the ability of CHEMICALIN to block GENEIN-mediated disassembly of GENEIN filaments demonstrate that significant inhibition of GENEIN function occurs only at CHEMICALIN concentrations that promote GENEIN oligomerization. Together these studies support a unique mode of inhibition in which CHEMICALIN disrupt the GENEIN/GENEIN interaction by sequestering GENEIN via small molecule-induced oligomerization.
23201124	Substrates of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN identified with a designed orthogonal GENENOTIN, the NEDDylator. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are guardian GENENOTIN that keep classic proapoptotic proteins in check. Systematic identification of additional IAP substrates is challenged by the heterogeneity and sheer number of ubiquitinated proteins (>5,000). Here we report a powerful catalytic tagging tool, the NEDDylator, which fuses a GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, to the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN. This permits transfer of the rare GENENOTIN homolog GENENOTIN to the GENENOTIN substrates, allowing them to be efficiently purified for LC-MS/MS identification. We have identified >50 potential GENENOTIN substrates of both cytosolic and mitochondrial origin that bear hallmark CHEMICALIN-terminal GENEIN binding motifs. These substrates include the recently discovered GENENOTIN GENENOTIN, which we show is proteolytically processed, accumulates in cytosol during apoptosis, and sensitizes cells to death. These studies reveal mechanisms and antagonistic partners for specific GENENOTIN, and provide a powerful technology for labeling binding partners in transient protein-protein complexes.
12662154	Cloning and expression of the liver and muscle isoforms of GENENOTIN: residues within the CHEMICALNOTIN-terminus of the muscle isoform influence the kinetic properties of the enzyme. The CHEMICALNOTIN sequence data reported will appear in DDBJ, EMBL, GenBank(R) and GSDB CHEMICALNOTIN Sequence Databases; the sequences of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN cDNAs have the accession numbers GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN respectively and the partial adipose tissue and liver GENENOTIN clones have the accession numbers GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN respectively. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN body metabolism differ considerably between monogastric and ruminant species. The regulation of the key enzymes involved may differ accordingly. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is the key locus for the control of long-chain CHEMICALNOTIN beta-oxidation and liver ketogenesis. Previously we showed that GENENOTIN kinetics in sheep and rat liver mitochondria differ. We cloned cDNAs for both isoforms [liver- (L-) and muscle- (M-)] of GENENOTIN in order to elucidate the structural features of these proteins and their genes ( GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN ). Their deduced CHEMICALNOTIN sequences show a high degree of conservation compared with orthologues from other mammalian species, with the notable exception of the CHEMICALIN-terminus of GENEIN. These differences were also present in GENEIN, whose CHEMICALIN-terminal sequence we determined. In addition, the 5'-end of the GENENOTIN cDNA suggested a different promoter architecture when compared with previously characterized GENENOTIN genes. Northern blotting revealed differences in tissue distribution for both GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transcripts compared with other species. In particular, GENENOTIN mRNA was less tissue restricted, and the predominant transcript in the pancreas was GENENOTIN. Expression in yeast allowed kinetic characterization of the two native enzymes, and of a chimaera in which the distinctive CHEMICALIN-terminal segment of GENEIN was replaced with that from GENENOTIN. The ovine CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal segment influences the kinetics of the enzyme for both its substrates, such that the K (m) for CHEMICALNOTIN is decreased and that for CHEMICALNOTIN is increased for the chimaera, relative to the parental GENENOTIN.
7912539	Cardiac effects of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN in man. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the cardiac effects of the GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN, and determine whether GENENOTIN are involved in mediating chronotropic or inotropic responses in man. Eight normal males received single oral doses of CHEMICALNOTIN 8 mg (CHEMICALNOTIN) or the selective GENEIN agonist CHEMICALIN 8 mg (CHEMICALIN), after pretreatment with either placebo (PL), CHEMICALIN 5 mg (B5) as a selective GENEIN antagonist, or CHEMICALNOTIN 20 mg (N20) to block GENENOTIN. Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN produced a significant increase in postural finger tremor in keeping with GENEIN stimulation, and this response was totally abolished by pretreatment with N20. Significant increases in systolic blood pressure and Doppler stroke distance occurred with CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN which were unaffected by pretreatment with B5 and completely blocked by N20, in keeping with GENENOTIN-mediated effects. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN produced significant chronotropic and minute distance responses which were unaffected by GENENOTIN blockade. However, whereas N20 blocked these responses to CHEMICALNOTIN, a small but significant response occurred with CHEMICALNOTIN in comparison with placebo despite complete blockade of co-existing GENENOTIN-mediated effects. Compared with PL, the mean responses to N20/CHEMICALNOTIN, and the 95% confidence interval for the differences between the means were 7.4 beats min-1 [3.2 to 11.6] (P = 0.002) for heart rate, and 208.8 cm [38.3 to 379.3] (P = 0.02) for minute distance responses.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
23085979	GENENOTIN-mediated disruption of contact inhibition is associated with GENENOTIN downregulation and inhibition of gap junctional intercellular communication. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) contributes to the control of cell-to-cell communication, cell adhesion, migration or proliferation. In the present study, we investigated the regulation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN-mediated gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) during the GENENOTIN-dependent disruption of contact inhibition in non-tumorigenic liver epithelial cells. The contact inhibition of cell proliferation is a process restricting the cell division of confluent non-transformed cells, which is frequently abolished in cancer cells; however, the mechanisms contributing to its disruption are still only partially understood. Disruption of contact inhibition, which was induced by toxic GENEIN ligands CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) or CHEMICALIN in epithelial WB-F344 cells, reduced GENEIN protein levels, possibly via enhanced proteasomal degradation, significantly decreased the amount of gap junction plaques and downregulated GJIC, in an GENEIN-dependent manner. Although both intracellular and membrane GENEIN pools were markedly reduced in cells released from contact inhibition by CHEMICALIN, siRNA-mediated GENEIN knock-down was not sufficient to stimulate proliferation in contact-inhibited cells. Our data suggest that downregulation of GENENOTIN/GJIC in non-transformed epithelial cells is an inherent part of disruption of contact inhibition, which occurs at the post-transcriptional level. This process runs in parallel with alterations of other forms of cell-to-cell communication, thus suggesting that toxic GENENOTIN agonists may simultaneously abrogate contact inhibition and reduce GJIC, two essential mechanisms linked to deregulation of cell-to-cell communication during tumor promotion and progression.
23142507	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), a novel heterodimeric GENENOTIN from Heterometrus laoticus scorpion venom. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a GENENOTIN produced in Heterometrus laoticus, in Thailand. In this study, GENENOTIN was purified from venom by separation chromatography, and the GENENOTIN activity of the fractions was determined by lecithin agar assay. The enzyme is an acidic protein with a pI of 5.6 and an apparent molecular weight of 14018.4 Da. The CHEMICALIN sequence of GENEIN contains 649 bp, and the mature protein is predicted to have 131 CHEMICALIN residues-104 of which make up the large subunit, and 27 of which make up the small subunit. The subunit structure of GENENOTIN is highly similar to that of the other toxin, Pandinus imperator imperatoxin I (IpTx(i)) and to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The 3D-structure of GENEIN consists of three conserved alpha-helices: h1 (CHEMICALIN24-CHEMICALIN34), h2 (CHEMICALIN59-CHEMICALIN71), and h3 (CHEMICALIN80-CHEMICALIN89). The beta-sheet consisted of a single stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet (b1.1 at CHEMICALNOTIN43-CHEMICALNOTIN45 and b1.2 at CHEMICALNOTIN48-CHEMICALNOTIN50) that was highly similar to the conserved sequences (-CGXG-, -CCXXHDXC- and CXCEXXXXXC-) of Apis mellifera (bee) GENENOTIN.
23612710	Comparative phosphoproteomic analysis of checkpoint recovery identifies new regulators of the DNA damage response. How cells recover from a DNA damage-induced arrest is currently poorly understood. We performed large-scale quantitative phosphoproteomics to identify changes in protein phosphorylation that occurred during recovery from arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle caused by DNA damage. We identified 154 proteins that were differentially phosphorylated, and systematic depletion of each of these differentially phosphorylated proteins by small interfering RNA (siRNA) identified at least 10 potential regulators of recovery. Astrin, a protein associated with the mitotic spindle, was among the potential regulators of recovery. We found that astrin controlled the abundance of the cell cycle regulator p53 during DNA damage-induced arrest. Cells in which astrin was depleted had decreased murine double minute 2 (MDM2) abundance and increased p53 at the later stages of the DNA damage response. Astrin was required for continued expression of genes encoding proteins that promote cell cycle progression in arrested cells. Thus, by controlling p53 abundance in cells recovering from DNA damage, astrin maintains the cells in a state competent to resume the cell cycle.
14638499	Molecular mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN resistance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Ten mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae resistant to the antimycotic CHEMICALNOTIN were isolated after chemical or UV mutagenesis. Molecular analysis of these mutants revealed single base pair exchanges in the GENEIN gene coding for GENEIN, the target of CHEMICALIN. The mutants did not show cross-resistance to any of the substrates of various pleiotropic drug resistance efflux pumps tested. The GENENOTIN mRNA levels in the mutants did not differ from those in the wild-type parent strains. CHEMICALNOTIN resistance was transmitted with the mutated alleles in gene replacement experiments, proving that single CHEMICALIN substitutions in the GENEIN protein were sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. The CHEMICALIN changes caused by the point mutations were clustered in two regions of the GENEIN protein. Seven mutants carried the CHEMICALNOTIN substitutions GENENOTIN (one mutant), GENENOTIN (one mutant), and GENENOTIN (five mutants) in the CHEMICALNOTIN-terminal part of the protein; and three mutants carried an GENENOTIN exchange in the central part of the protein. Interestingly, all exchanges identified involved CHEMICALIN which are conserved in the GENEIN of yeasts and mammals. Two mutations that were generated by PCR mutagenesis of the GENEIN gene and that conferred CHEMICALIN resistance mapped in the same regions of the GENEIN protein, with one resulting in an GENENOTIN exchange and the other resulting in an GENENOTIN exchange. The results strongly indicate that these regions are responsible for the interaction of GENEIN with CHEMICALIN.
14871882	Ornithine metabolism in male and female rat kidney: mitochondrial expression of ornithine aminotransferase and arginase II. In the kidney, L-ornithine is reabsorbed along the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT), transported by basolateral carriers, and produced by arginase II (AII). Here, the renal metabolic fate of L-ornithine was analyzed in male and female rats. Kidneys and renal zones were dissected and used for Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence, and electron microscopic studies. Ornithine aminotransferase (OAT) and AII were localized using specific antibodies. Ornithine oxidation was determined by incubating microdissected tubules with L-[1-14C] or L-[U-14C]ornithine in the presence or absence of energy-providing substrates. Ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) mRNAs were localized by in situ hybridization. The 48-kDa OAT protein was detected in male and female kidneys, but its level was fourfold higher in the latter. OAT relative distribution increased from the superficial cortex toward the outer medulla to reach its highest level. Almost all OAT protein was localized in cortical and medullary proximal straight tubules (CPST and OSPST, respectively). In proximal straight tubule (PST), AII protein distribution overlapped that of OAT. No gender difference in AII protein level was found. OAT and AII were colocalized within PST mitochondria. L-[1-14C]ornithine decarboxylation occurred in all tubules, but predominantly in proximal tubules. L-[1-14C]ornithine decarboxylation was enhanced when L-[1-14C]ornithine was given to tubules as the sole substrate. The use of L-[U-14C]ornithine demonstrated the complete oxidation of ornithine. In conclusion, the OAT gene was expressed more in female rat proximal tubules than in male. Because OAT and AII proteins overlapped in PST mitochondria, L-arginine-derived ornithine may be preferentially converted to L-glutamate, as proven by ornithine oxidation. However, the coexpression of ODC, glutamate decarboxylase, and glutamine synthetase in PST suggests that L-ornithine can also be metabolized to putrescine, GABA, and L-glutamine. The fate of L-ornithine may depend on the cellular context.
17075268	CHEMICALIN suppresses CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis by repressing both transcription and activity of GENEIN in allergic rats. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALIN synthesized by GENEIN (GENEIN) from CHEMICALIN is a major chemical mediator in the development of nasal allergy which is characterized by nasal hypersensitivity. However the regulatory mechanism of CHEMICALIN synthesis by GENEIN remains to be elucidated. The objectives of the present study were to examine the changes of CHEMICALNOTIN content, GENEIN activity and GENEIN mRNA expression in the nasal mucosa of allergy model rats sensitized by the exposure to CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and to investigate the effect of CHEMICALIN on the above mentioned allergic parameters. METHODS: Rats were sensitized and provocated by CHEMICALNOTIN and the nasal allergy-like behaviors were scored during a 10 minute period after provocation. CHEMICALNOTIN content and GENENOTIN activity in the nasal mucosa were determined using fluorometric high performance liquid chromatography. The expression of GENENOTIN mRNA in nasal mucosa was determined using real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: In CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitized rats, nasal allergy-like behaviors such as sneezing and watery rhinorrhea were induced. CHEMICALNOTIN content, GENEIN activity and GENEIN mRNA expression in nasal mucosa were also significantly increased after CHEMICALIN provocation. Pretreatment with CHEMICALIN significantly suppressed nasal allergy-like behaviors, up-regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN content, GENEIN activity and GENEIN mRNA induced by CHEMICALIN in CHEMICALIN-sensitized rats. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that increased synthesis of CHEMICALIN through up-regulation of GENEIN gene expression and GENEIN activity in nasal mucosa plays an important role in the development of nasal hypersensitivity. Repression of GENEIN gene expression and GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN may underlie its therapeutic effect in the treatment of allergy.
23223345	The Effects of CHEMICALIN, Unsaturated Fat, and Protein Intake on Measures of GENEIN Sensitivity: Results from the OmniHeart Trial. OBJECTIVE Impaired GENENOTIN sensitivity increases the risk of cardiovascular disease. Although calorie restriction and weight loss increase GENENOTIN sensitivity, the effects of modifying macronutrient composition on GENENOTIN sensitivity are uncertain. The purpose of this study is to determine the effects on GENEIN sensitivity of a CHEMICALIN-rich diet (CHEMICALNOTIN; similar to the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH] diet), a protein-rich diet (PROT; protein predominantly from plant sources), and an unsaturated fat-rich diet (UNSAT; predominantly monounsaturated). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a randomized, controlled, three-period, crossover feeding study. The study participants were 164 individuals with prehypertension or stage 1 hypertension without diabetes. Diets were administered for 6 weeks each, with a washout period between diets of 2-4 weeks. Weight was held constant throughout the study. For our primary outcome, we calculated the quantitative GENENOTIN sensitivity check index (QUICKI) using the end-of-period fasting serum CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN. QUICKI is a validated measure of GENENOTIN sensitivity. The primary analyses used generalized estimating equations. RESULTS At baseline, mean (SD) BMI was 30.2 (6.1) kg/m(2), and mean (SD) QUICKI was 0.35 (0.04). The UNSAT diet increased QUICKI by 0.005, more than the CHEMICALNOTIN diet (P = 0.04). PROT had no significant effect compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. CONCLUSIONS A diet that partially replaces CHEMICALIN with unsaturated fat may improve GENEIN sensitivity in a population at risk for cardiovascular disease. Given the well-recognized challenges of sustaining weight loss, our results suggest an alternative approach for improving GENENOTIN sensitivity.
16534527	Antiobesity action of peripheral exenatide (exendin-4) in rodents: effects on food intake, body weight, metabolic status and side-effect measures. BACKGROUND: Exenatide (exendin-4) is an incretin mimetic currently marketed as an antidiabetic agent for patients with type 2 diabetes. In preclinical models, a reduction in body weight has also been shown in low-fat-fed, leptin receptor-deficient rodents. OBJECTIVE: To more closely model the polygenic and environmental state of human obesity, we characterized the effect of exenatide on food intake and body weight in high-fat-fed, normal (those with an intact leptin signaling system) rodents. As glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism has been found to elicit behaviors associated with visceral illness in rodents, we also examined the effect of peripheral exenatide on kaolin consumption and locomotor activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: High-fat-fed C57BL/6 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with exenatide (3, 10 and 30 microg/kg/day) for 4 weeks via subcutaneously implanted osmotic pumps. Food intake and body weight were assessed weekly. At 4 weeks, body composition and plasma metabolic profiles were measured. Kaolin consumption and locomotor activity were measured in fasted Sprague-Dawley rats following a single intraperitoneal injection of exenatide (0.1-10 microg/kg). Exenatide treatment in mice and rats dose-dependently decreased food intake and body weight; significant reductions in body weight gain were observed throughout treatment at 10 and 30 microg/kg/day (P<0.05). Decreased body weight gain was associated with a significant decrease in fat mass (P<0.05) with sparing of lean tissue. Plasma cholesterol, triglycerides and insulin were also significantly reduced (P<0.05). Exenatide at 10 microg/kg significantly reduced food intake (P<0.05) but failed to induce kaolin intake. In general, locomotor activity was reduced at doses of exenatide that decreased food intake, although a slightly higher dose was required to produce significant changes in activity. CONCLUSION: Systemic exenatide reduces body weight gain in normal, high-fat-fed rodents, a model that parallels human genetic variation and food consumption patterns, and may play a role in metabolic pathways mediating food intake.
23381968	Different effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on the enantioselective pharmacokinetics of CHEMICALNOTIN and its active metabolites in healthy subjects. In this study, we assessed the effects of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, known GENEIN and GENEIN inhibitors, respectively, on the enantioselective disposition of CHEMICALIN in conjunction with GENEIN polymorphisms in humans. CHEMICALNOTIN showed enantioselective plasma profiles with consistently higher concentrations of R-enantiomers. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN significantly increased the CHEMICALNOTIN plasma concentration, but their effects differed between enantiomers; a 2.2-fold versus 4.1-fold increase in the AUC in S-enantiomer and 1.8-fold versus 2.0-fold for the R-enantiomer, respectively. The AUCs of S- and R-desmethyl metabolites changed significantly during the CHEMICALNOTIN phase (Pâ<â.001 and Pâ<â.001, respectively) but not during the CHEMICALNOTIN phase (Pâ=â.099 and Pâ=â.090, respectively). Exposure to CHEMICALIN was higher in subjects with the GENEIN*6/*6 genotype, but no statistical difference was observed among the GENENOTIN genotypes. These results suggest that the enantioselective disposition of CHEMICALIN and its active metabolites are influenced by the altered genetic and environmental factors of GENEIN and GENEIN activity in vivo.
23506002	New selective inhibitors of MMP-13 for inflammatory diseases: a patent evaluation (W02012151158). A series of compounds incorporating an aromatic scaffold based on isoxazolines were prepared in the patent application (WO2012151158). The new compounds from the patent are defined to be biologically active metabolites, prodrugs, isomers, stereoisomers, solvates, hydrates and pharmaceutically acceptable salts, they are claimed to be useful for treating immunological conditions because of their inhibitory activities on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP-13), although no specific MMP-13 inhibition data or other rationale to explain their biological effects is provided. The compounds have a broad potential utility with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, degenerative joint disease or systemic lupus erythematosus among the likely preferred indications.
23609963	LIVER X RECEPTORS, NERVOUS SYSTEM AND LIPID METABOLISM. Lipids in the nervous system are represented by cholesterol and phospholipids as constituents of cell membranes and, in particular, of myelin. Therefore, lipids are finely regulated to guarantee physiological functions. In the central nervous system, cholesterol is locally synthesized due to the presence of the blood brain barrier. In the peripheral nervous system cholesterol is either uptaken by lipoproteins and/or produced by de novo biosynthesis. Defects in lipid homeostasis in these tissues lead to structural and functional changes that often result in different pathological conditions depending on the affected pathways (i.e. cholesterol biosynthesis, cholesterol efflux, fatty acid biosynthesis etc.). Alterations in cholesterol metabolism in the central nervous system are linked to several disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington disease, Parkinson disease, Multiple Sclerosis, Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome, Niemann-Pick type C disease, and glioblastoma. In the peripheral nervous system changes in lipid metabolism are associated with the development of peripheral neuropathy that may be caused by metabolic disorders, injuries, therapeutics and autoimmune diseases. Transcription factors, such as the Liver X receptors (LXRs), regulate both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism in several tissues including the nervous system. In the last few years several studies elucidated the biology of LXRs in nervous system due to the availability of knock-out mice and the development of synthetic ligands. Here, we review a survey of the literature focused on central and peripheral nervous system and in physiological and pathological settings with particular attention on the roles played by LXRs in both districts.
11972613	CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent GENENOTIN production leading to eosinophilia during late asthmatic response in guinea-pigs. BACKGROUND: Allergic airway eosinophilia is suppressed by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN receptor) antagonists in several species including humans and guinea-pigs, suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN are directly or indirectly involved in induction of the response. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists (CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN) on antigen inhalation-induced eosinophilia in peripheral blood and lung, and on GENEIN activity in serum during late increase of airway resistance (late asthmatic response, LAR) in sensitized guinea-pigs. METHODS: Guinea-pigs inhaled GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) + CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN mists alternately for sensitization and challenge, respectively, once every 2 weeks. At the fifth challenge, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists and an anti-GENENOTIN antibody (TRFK-5) on the occurrence of LAR, and blood and lung eosinophilia, which appeared at 5 h after challenge, were examined. The time-course of GENENOTIN activity in the serum after the challenge was evaluated by measuring in vitro 'eosinophil survival prolongation activity'. The influence of CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists on GENENOTIN activity was assessed. RESULTS: CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists and TRFK-5 completely abolished blood and lung eosinophilia. LAR was suppressed by both CHEMICALNOTIN and TRFK-5 by 40-50%. Sera obtained from sensitized, challenged animals 3 h and 4 h after challenge induced an obvious prolongation of eosinophil survival. The activity of the sera was completely neutralized by prior exposure to TRFK-5, suggesting that it reflected GENENOTIN activity. Increased GENEIN activity in the serum was inhibited by both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN by over 90%. CONCLUSIONS: CHEMICALIN produced after antigen provocation sequentially induced GENENOTIN production from some immune component cells via GENEIN receptor activation. Thus, it is likely that CHEMICALNOTIN indirectly cause antigen-induced eosinophilia through GENENOTIN production.
22890749	Theoretical study of the decomposition of ethyl and ethyl 3-phenyl glycidate. The mechanism of the decomposition of ethyl and ethyl 3-phenyl glycidate in gas phase was studied by density functional theory (DFT) and MP2 methods. A proposed mechanism for the reaction indicates that the ethyl side of the ester is eliminated as ethylene through a concerted six-membered cyclic transition state, and the unstable intermediate glycidic acid decarboxylates rapidly to give the corresponding aldehyde. Two possible pathways for glycidic acid decarboxylation were studied: one via a five-membered cyclic transition state, and the other via a four-membered cyclic transition state. The results of the calculations indicate that the decarboxylation reaction occurs via a mechanism with five-membered cyclic transition state.
15598972	CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, novel templates of GENEIN GENEIN openers, depress cortical neuron activity and exhibit anticonvulsant properties. The voltage-dependent M-type CHEMICALNOTIN current (M-current) plays a major role in controlling brain excitability by stabilizing the membrane potential and acting as a brake for neuronal firing. The GENENOTIN heteromeric channel complex was identified as the molecular correlate of the M-current. Furthermore, the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are mutated in families with benign familial neonatal convulsions, a neonatal form of epilepsy. Enhancement of GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN currents may provide an important target for antiepileptic drug development. Here, we show that CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and CHEMICALIN, two related molecules previously used as anti-inflammatory drugs, act as novel GENEIN channel openers. Extracellular application of CHEMICALIN (EC(50) = 25 microM) and CHEMICALIN (EC(50) = 2.6 microM) resulted in the activation of GENEIN K(+) currents, heterologously expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Both openers activated GENENOTIN channels by causing a hyperpolarizing shift of the voltage activation curve (-23 and -15 mV, respectively) and by markedly slowing the deactivation kinetics. The effects of the drugs were stronger on GENENOTIN than on GENENOTIN. In contrast, they did not enhance GENENOTIN K(+) currents. Both openers increased GENENOTIN current amplitude at physiologically relevant potentials and led to hyperpolarization of the resting membrane potential. In cultured cortical neurons, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN enhanced the M-current and reduced evoked and spontaneous action potentials, whereas in vivo CHEMICALNOTIN exhibited an anticonvulsant activity (ED(50) = 43 mg/kg). These compounds potentially constitute novel drug templates for the treatment of neuronal hyperexcitability including epilepsy, migraine, or neuropathic pain.
12431845	CHEMICALNOTIN increases extracellular levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in prefrontal cortex of rat: a potential mechanism for efficacy in attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder. The selective GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (formerly called CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN) has been shown to alleviate symptoms in Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). We investigated the mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN in ADHD by evaluating the interaction of CHEMICALIN with GENEIN, the effects on extracellular levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, and the expression of the neuronal activity marker GENEIN in brain regions. CHEMICALIN inhibited binding of radioligands to clonal cell lines transfected with GENENOTIN with dissociation constants (K(i)) values of 5, 77 and 1451 nM, respectively, demonstrating selectivity for GENEIN. In microdialysis studies, CHEMICALNOTIN increased extracellular (EX) levels of CHEMICALNOTIN in prefrontal cortex (PFC) 3-fold, but did not alter 5-HT(EX) levels. CHEMICALNOTIN also increased DA(EX) concentrations in PFC 3-fold, but did not alter DA(EX) in striatum or nucleus accumbens. In contrast, the psychostimulant CHEMICALNOTIN, which is used in ADHD therapy, increased NE(EX) and DA(EX) equally in PFC, but also increased DA(EX) in the striatum and nucleus accumbens to the same level. The expression of the neuronal activity marker GENEIN was increased 3.7-fold in PFC by CHEMICALIN administration, but was not increased in the striatum or nucleus accumbens, consistent with the regional distribution of increased DA(EX). We hypothesize that the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced increase of CHEMICALNOTIN in PFC, a region involved in attention and memory, mediates the therapeutic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN in ADHD. In contrast to CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN did not increase CHEMICALNOTIN in striatum or nucleus accumbens, suggesting it would not have motoric or drug abuse liabilities.
23298698	Locally administered CHEMICALNOTIN prevents aeroallergen-induced airway sensitization in mice through immunomodulatory mechanisms. CHEMICALNOTIN attenuates airway pathology in asthmatic patients and exerts a protective effect in antigen-sensitized mice when administered systemically. We aimed to establish the consequences of intranasal CHEMICALNOTIN administration on airway reactivity to aeroallergens in mice and reveal the underlying immunoinflammatory mechanisms. CHEMICALNOTIN was administered either daily during a 10-day exposure to house dust mite (HDM) extracts or for limited intervals. Airway hyperreactivity was measured by whole-body and invasive plethysmography. The phenotypes of lung immune cells and GENENOTIN production were analysed by flow cytometry and ELISA, respectively. Airway hyperreactivity was sustainably reduced only when CHEMICALNOTIN administration was restricted to the initial 5 days of exposure to HDM. Lung inflammation, GENEIN production, and airway mast cell activity were also prevented under this early short-term treatment with CHEMICALIN. Interestingly, a Th2 response was already committed on day 5 of exposure to HDM. This was paralleled by GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN upregulation and a decreased number of plasmacytoid dendritic and T regulatory cells, as well as a trend towards reduced GENENOTIN expression. Local CHEMICALIN administration prevented the increase of airway GENEIN and GENEIN and kept lung plasmacytoid dendritic cell counts close to baseline. GENENOTIN and Tregs were unaffected by the treatment. These findings suggest that the protection provided by CHEMICALNOTIN is a result of the modulation of early lung immunomodulatory mechanisms, and possibly a shift in the balance of dendritic cells towards a tolerogenic profile.
23220589	In vitro investigation of efficacy of new reactivators on OPC inhibited GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN compounds (OPC) were developed as warfare nerve agents. They are also widely used as pesticides. The drug therapy of intoxication with OPC includes mainly combination of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) reactivators and cholinolytics. There is no single GENENOTIN reactivator having an ability to reactivate sufficiently the inhibited enzyme due to the high variability of chemical structure of the inhibitors. The difficulties in reactivation of GENENOTIN activity and slight antidote effect regarding intoxication with some OPC are some of the reasons for continuous efforts to obtain new reactivators of GENENOTIN. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of some GENENOTIN reactivators against OPC intoxication (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) in in vitro experiments and to compare their activity to that known for some currently used CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN). Experiments were carried out using GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Reactivators showed different activity in the reactivation of GENEIN after CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN inhibition. GENEIN was easier reactivated after CHEMICALIN treatment. The best effect showed CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN from the group of symmetric CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN from asymmetric compounds. The reactivation of brain GENEIN inhibited with tabun demonstrated better activity of new compound CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN from symmetric CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN possessing asymmetric structure. All compounds showed low activity toward inhibition of GENEIN caused by CHEMICALIN. Comparison of two main structure types (symmetric/asymmetric) showed that the symmetric compounds reactivated better GENENOTIN, inhibited with this OPC, than asymmetric ones.
15562257	State-dependent CHEMICALIN block of GENEIN. CHEMICALIN is a GENEIN antagonist with reported cross-reactivity with other classes of ion channels, including GENENOTIN. Using whole-cell voltage clamp, we examined CHEMICALIN block of four GENEIN isoforms expressed in human embryonic kidney cells: GENEIN (cardiac), GENEIN (skeletal muscle), GENEIN (brain), and GENEIN (peripheral nerve). CHEMICALIN blocked GENEIN in a use/frequency-dependent manner, indicating preferential binding to states visited during depolarization. CHEMICALIN blocked currents of all GENEIN isoforms with similar affinity and a dependence on holding potential, and drug off-rate was slowed at depolarized potentials (k(off) was 0.024/s at -130 mV and 0.007/s at -100 mV for GENEIN). We further probed the interaction of CHEMICALIN with inactivated GENEIN channels. Neither the degree nor the time course of block was dependent on the stimulus duration, which dramatically changed the residency time of channels in the fast-inactivated state. In addition, inhibiting the binding of the fast inactivation lid (GENEIN ICM + MTSET) did not alter CHEMICALIN block, confirming that the drug does not preferentially interact with the fast-inactivated state. We also tested whether CHEMICALNOTIN interacted with slow-inactivated state(s). When selectively applied to channels after inducing slow inactivation with a 60-s pulse to -10 mV, CHEMICALIN (1 microM) produced 45% fractional block in GENEIN and greater block (88%) in an isoform (GENEIN) that slow-inactivates more completely. Our results suggest that CHEMICALIN blocks GENEIN in a state-dependent manner that does not depend on fast inactivation but probably involves interaction with one or more slow-inactivated state(s).
23154865	Enhanced heterodimerization of Bax by Bcl-2 mutants improves irradiated cell survival. B Cell Lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) protein suppresses ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis in hemato-lymphoid system. To enhance the survival of irradiated cells, we have compared the effects and mechanism of Bcl-2 and its functional variants, D34A (caspase-3 resistant) and S70E (mimics phosphorylation on S70). Bcl-2 and its mutants were transfected into hematopoietic cell line and assessed for cell survival, clonogenicity and cell cycle perturbations upon exposure to ionizing radiation. The electrostatic potential of BH3 cleft of Bcl-2/mutants and their heterodimerization with Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax) were computationally evaluated. Correspondingly, these results were verified by co-immunoprecipitation and western blotting. The mutants afford higher radioprotective effect than Bcl-2 in apoptotic and clonogenic assays at D(0) (radiation dose at which 37Â % cell survival was observed). The computational and functional analysis indicates that mutants have higher propensity to neutralize Bax protein by heterodimerization and have increased caspase-9 suppression capability, which is responsible for enhanced survival. This study implies potential of Bcl-2 mutants or their chemical/peptide mimics to elicit radioprotective effect in cells exposed to radiation.
15714982	[Treatment of CHEMICALNOTIN-independent hormone refractory prostate cancer using CHEMICALNOTIN]. Although prostate cancer patients with metastatic lesion initially respond to CHEMICALNOTIN ablation therapy, almost patients develop to hormone-refractory states. The optimal treatment for men with hormone refractory prostate cancer (HRPC) has not been established. CHEMICALIN is a semisynthetic CHEMICALIN that inhibit tumor growth by induction of microtubule stabilization and promotion of GENEIN inactivation, which induce apoptosis. CHEMICALNOTIN as single agent has significant anti-tumor effect in HRPC patients. CHEMICALNOTIN combined with CHEMICALNOTIN or other antimicrotubular agents have shown further significant cytotoxicity in HRPC patients. In the United States, Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved CHEMICALNOTIN, injection in combination with CHEMICALNOTIN for the treatment of patients with advanced metastatic prostate cancer in 2004.
18708991	GENENOTIN polymorphisms influence steady-state plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN active moiety. CHEMICALIN is metabolized to its active metabolite, CHEMICALIN, mainly by the GENEIN enzymes GENENOTIN. Its antipsychotic effect is assumed to be related to the active moiety, that is, the sum of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN are substrates of GENEIN (GENEIN), a transport protein involved in drug absorption, distribution, and elimination. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of polymorphisms in genes encoding GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) on the steady-state plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and the active moiety, taking GENENOTIN genotype status into account. Forty-six white patients with schizophrenia treated with CHEMICALNOTIN (1-10 mg/d) in monotherapy for 4-6 weeks were genotyped, and their plasma concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were measured. Dose-corrected plasma concentrations (C/D) of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and active moiety showed up to 68-, 9-, and 10-fold interindividual variation, respectively. Six patients carried 1 GENENOTIN*1 allele and therefore were likely to express the GENENOTIN enzyme. The GENENOTIN genotype did not influence CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or active moiety C/Ds. The GENENOTIN genotype in these 46 patients was again associated with CHEMICALNOTIN C/D (P = 0.001) but not with CHEMICALNOTIN C/D or active moiety C/D, as previously shown by our group in 37 of these patients. Patients homozygous for the GENENOTIN 3435T/2677T/1236T haplotype had significantly lower C/Ds of CHEMICALNOTIN (P = 0.026) and active moiety (P = 0.028) than patients carrying other GENENOTIN genotypes. In conclusion, our results confirmed the significant effect of GENENOTIN genotype on the steady-state plasma levels of CHEMICALNOTIN and showed that GENENOTIN polymorphisms have a moderate effect on those of CHEMICALNOTIN and the active moiety.
15133083	CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism in a member of the phylum Microspora (Encephalitozoon cuniculi): effects of CHEMICALNOTIN analogues. The uptake, biosynthesis and catabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN in the microsporidian parasite Encephalitozoon cuniculi are detailed with reference to the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN analogues of CHEMICALNOTIN. Enc. cuniculi, an intracellular parasite of mammalian cells, has both biosynthetic and catabolic enzymes of CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism, as demonstrated in cell-free extracts of mature spores. The uptake of CHEMICALNOTIN was measured in immature, pre-emergent spores isolated from host cells by Percoll gradient. Spermine was rapidly taken up and metabolized to spermidine and an unknown, possibly acetamidopropanal, by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Most of the CHEMICALNOTIN and the unknown product were found in the cell incubation medium, indicating they were released from the cell. CHEMICALNOTIN analogues of CHEMICALNOTIN, such as CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, as well as CHEMICALNOTIN analogues [CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN 3-7-3 analogue] blocked uptake and interconversion of CHEMICALNOTIN at micromolar levels and, in the case of CHEMICALIN, acted as substrate for GENEIN. The GENENOTIN activity differed from that found in mammalian cells with respect to pH optimum, substrate specificity and sensitivity to known GENENOTIN inhibitors. CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN activity with a mixed type of inhibition in which the analogue had a 70-fold higher affinity for the enzyme than the natural substrate, CHEMICALIN. The interest in Enc. cuniculi polyamine metabolism and the biochemical effects of these CHEMICALNOTIN analogues is warranted since they cure model infections of Enc. cuniculi in mice and are potential candidates for human clinical trials.
23497227	Synthesis and in vitro evaluation of CHEMICALIN derivatives as potent GENEIN inhibitors. A series of CHEMICALIN have been synthesised, characterised and tested for their in vitro GENEIN GENEIN inhibitory activity. The compounds were prepared from CHEMICALNOTIN. Their final structure of the compounds were elucidated on the basis of spectral studies (IR., CHEMICALNOTIN NMR, FT-IR and EI-MS). The cellular GENENOTIN internalization response of selected compounds was evaluated using HeLa cells. Most of the synthesized compounds displayed potent GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN inhibitory activity and structurally halogenated derivatives had a pronounced effect in inhibiting GENENOTIN internalization.

17600786	A fluorescent polymeric heparin sensor. Linear copolymers have been developed which carry binding sites tailored for sulfated sugars. All binding monomers are based on the methacrylamide skeleton and ensure statistical radical copolymerization. They are decorated with o-aminomethylphenylboronates for covalent ester formation and/or alkylammonium ions for noncovalent Coulomb attraction. Alcohol sidechains maintain a high water solubility; a dansyl monomer was constructed as a fluorescence label. Statistical copolymerization of comonomer mixtures with optimized ratios was started by AIBN (AIBN=2,2'-azoisobutyronitrile) and furnished water-soluble comonomers with an exceptionally high affinity for glucosaminoglucans. Heparin can be quantitatively detected with an unprecedented 30 nM sensitivity, and a neutral polymer without any ammonium cation is still able to bind the target with almost micromolar affinity. From this unexpected result, we propose a new binding scheme between the boronate and a sulfated ethylene glycol or aminoethanol unit. Although the mechanism of heparin binding involves covalent boronate ester formation, it can be completely reversed by protamine addition, similar to heparin's complex formation with antithrombin III.
23397052	Impaired cliff avoidance reaction in dopamine transporter knockout mice. RATIONALE: Impulsivity is a key feature of disorders that include attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The cliff avoidance reaction (CAR) assesses maladaptive impulsive rodent behavior. Dopamine transporter knockout (DAT-KO) mice display features of ADHD and are candidates in which to test other impulsive phenotypes. OBJECTIVES: Impulsivity of DAT-KO mice was assessed in the CAR paradigm. For comparison, attentional deficits were also assessed in prepulse inhibition (PPI) in which DAT-KO mice have been shown to exhibit impaired sensorimotor gating. RESULTS: DAT-KO mice exhibited a profound CAR impairment compared to wild-type (WT) mice. As expected, DAT-KO mice showed PPI deficits compared to WT mice. Furthermore, the DAT-KO mice with the most impaired CAR exhibited the most severe PPI deficits. Treatment with methylphenidate or nisoxetine ameliorated CAR impairments in DAT-KO mice. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that DAT-KO mice exhibit impulsive CAR behavior that correlates with their PPI deficits. Blockade of monoamine transporters, especially the norepinephrine transporter (NET) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC), may contribute to pharmacological improvement of impulsivity in these mice.
10702256	GENENOTIN, a novel GENENOTIN synthesized by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. The interphotoreceptor matrix is a unique extracellular complex occupying the interface between photoreceptors and the retinal pigment epithelium in the fundus of the eye. Because of the putative supportive role in photoreceptor maintenance, it is likely that constituent molecules play key roles in photoreceptor function and may be targets for inherited CHEMICALNOTIN disease. In this study we identify and characterize GENENOTIN, a novel chondroitin proteoglycan in this matrix. GENENOTIN was cloned from a human CHEMICALNOTIN cDNA library and the gene localized to chromosome 3q11.2. Analysis of GENENOTIN mRNA and protein revealed that GENENOTIN is expressed exclusively by photoreceptors and pinealocytes. GENENOTIN synthesized by photoreceptors is localized to the interphotoreceptor matrix where it surrounds both rods and cones. The functional protein contains 1160 CHEMICALIN with a large central GENEIN, three consensus sites for glycosaminoglycan attachment, two epidermal growth factor-like repeats, a putative GENEIN, and a potential transmembrane domain near the CHEMICALIN-terminal. GENENOTIN and Western blotting indicate an M(r) around 400,000 before and 230,000 after GENENOTIN digestion. Removal of CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-linked oligosaccharides reduces the M(r) to approximately 160,000, suggesting that approximately 60% of the mass of GENEIN is CHEMICALNOTIN. Finally, we demonstrate that GENENOTIN binds GENENOTIN and propose that associations between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN may be involved in organization of the insoluble interphotoreceptor matrix, particularly as GENENOTIN is the major proteoglycan present in this matrix.
22981796	Validation of an in vitro exposure system for toxicity assessment of air-delivered nanomaterials. To overcome the limitations of in vitro exposure of submerged lung cells to nanoparticles (NPs), we validated an integrated low flow system capable of generating and depositing airborne NPs directly onto cells at an air-liquid interface (ALI). The in vitro exposure system was shown to provide uniform and controlled dosing of particles with 70.3% efficiency to epithelial cells grown on transwells. This system delivered a continuous airborne exposure of NPs to lung cells without loss of cell viability in repeated 4h exposure periods. We sequentially exposed cells to air-delivered CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) NPs in vitro to compare toxicity results to our prior in vivo inhalation studies. The evaluation of cellular dosimetry indicated that a large amount of CHEMICALNOTIN was taken up, dissolved and released into the basolateral medium (62% of total mass). Exposure to CHEMICALIN NPs decreased cell viability to 73% (p<0.01) and significantly (p<0.05) elevated levels of GENEIN, intracellular reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species and GENEIN that mirrored our findings from subacute in vivo inhalation studies in mice. Our results show that this exposure system is useful for screening of NP toxicity in a manner that represents cellular responses of the pulmonary epithelium in vivo.
23327993	GENENOTIN-mimetic peptides (TXM) reverse CHEMICALNOTIN induced apoptosis and restore GENENOTIN secretion in insulinoma cells. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN system (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) plays a major role in protecting cells from oxidative stress. Disruption of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN system keeps GENENOTIN in the oxidized state leading to cell death through activation of the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN apoptotic pathway. The potential mechanism and ability of tri- and tetra-oligopeptides derived from the canonical -GENENOTIN of the GENENOTIN-active site to mimic and enhance GENENOTIN cellular activity was examined. The GENENOTIN mimetics peptides (TXM) protected insulinoma INS 832/13 cells from oxidative stress induced by selectively inhibiting GENEIN with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). TXM reversed the CHEMICALNOTIN-effects preventing apoptosis, and increasing cell-viability. The TXM peptides were effective in inhibiting CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN(GENEIN) phosphorylation, in correlation with preventing GENEIN cleavage and thereby GENEIN dissociation. The ability to form a CHEMICALNOTIN-bridge-like conformation was estimated from molecular dynamics simulations. The TXM peptides restored GENENOTIN secretion and displayed GENENOTIN GENENOTIN activity. Their potency was 10-100-fold higher than redox reagents like CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, or CHEMICALNOTIN. Unable to reverse GENENOTIN phosphorylation, TXM-CB3 (CHEMICALIN) appeared to function in part, through inhibiting GENEIN-GENEIN dissociation. These highly effective anti-apoptotic effects of GENENOTIN mimetic peptides exhibited in INS 832/13 cells could become valuable in treating adverse oxidative-stress related disorders such as diabetes.
10617684	Preferential block of late CHEMICALIN current in the GENEIN by the class I(C) antiarrhythmic CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALIN block of CHEMICALNOTIN current (I(CHEMICALNOTIN)) was investigated in wild-type (WT) or the GENEIN subunit mutation with three CHEMICALIN deleted (GENEIN) stably transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells using whole-cell, patch-clamp recordings. CHEMICALNOTIN (1-300 mM) caused tonic and use-dependent block (UDB) of I(CHEMICALNOTIN) in a concentration-dependent manner. Compared with WT, GENEIN I(CHEMICALIN) was more sensitive to CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN preferentially inhibited late I(CHEMICALNOTIN) (mean current between 20 and 23.5 ms after depolarization) compared with peak I(CHEMICALNOTIN). The IC(50) value of peak and late I(CHEMICALNOTIN) for WT was 127 +/- 6 and 44 +/- 2 microM (n = 20) and for GENENOTIN was 80 +/- 9 and 19 +/- 2 microM (n = 31) respectively. UDB of peak I(CHEMICALNOTIN) was greater and developed more slowly during pulse trains for GENENOTIN than for WT. The IC(50) value for UDB of peak I(Na) for WT was 29 +/- 4 microM (n = 20) and for GENENOTIN was 11 +/- 1 microM (n = 26). For GENENOTIN, UDB of late I(CHEMICALNOTIN) was greater than for peak I(CHEMICALNOTIN). Recovery from block was slower for GENENOTIN than for WT. We conclude that GENEIN interacts differently with CHEMICALIN than with WT, leading to increased block and slowed recovery, especially for late I(CHEMICALNOTIN). These data provide insights into mechanisms for CHEMICALNOTIN block and provide a rationale at the cellular and molecular level that open channel block may be a useful pharmacological property for treatment of LQT3.
23118019	In vivo and in vitro characterization of CHEMICALIN-derived ligands at the GENEIN. Accumulating evidence supports a role for GENENOTIN antagonists in the treatment of mood disorders. Standard Îº-antagonists have an unusual pharmacodynamic action, with a single injection blocking receptor signaling for several weeks. Here, we have characterized the Îº-selective properties of two ligands, CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), to identify whether modifications of the CHEMICALNOTIN side chain produces short-acting Îº-antagonists. GENEIN binding affinity and activity were assessed using CHEMICALIN binding, CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binding and isolated guinea-pig ileum. Pharmacodynamic profiles of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN (1-10 mg/kg) were investigated using the tail-withdrawal assay and diuresis. Efficacy was also determined in depression- and anxiety-related behavioral paradigms in CD-1 mice. Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN had high affinity for GENEIN (K (i) 1.36 Â± 0.98 and 0.27 Â± 0.08, respectively) and were revealed as potent Îº-antagonists (pA(2) 7.43 and 8.18, respectively) and GENEIN antagonists (pA(2) 7.62 and 7.85, respectively) in the ileum. Contrary to our hypothesis, in vivo, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN displayed long-lasting antagonist effects in mice, reducing the antinociceptive actions of CHEMICALNOTIN (10 mg/kg) at 28 and 21 days post-injection, respectively. Interestingly, while CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were not Îº-selective, both compounds did show significant antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like effects at 7-14 days post-injection in mice.
23522834	Design and synthesis of highly selective, orally active GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is a potential therapeutic target for Parkinson's disease and this Letter describes the SAR of a series of CHEMICALIN based GENEIN inhibitors. By optimizing both the N-8 substituent and the biaryl region of the inhibitors we obtained single digit nanomolar compounds such as 37 with excellent selectivity for GENENOTIN over GENENOTIN. When dosed orally in rats, compound 37 demonstrated a 41-45% reduction of GENENOTIN levels in the cerebral cortex.
23583903	Effect of bioactive peptide of Carapax Trionycis on TGF-Î²1-induced intracellular events in hepatic stellate cells. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: In traditional Chinese medicines for hepatic fibrosis therapy, Carapax Trionycis is used usually as an indispensable component and has a long history of medical use in China. Previous studies have demonstrated that extracts of Carapax Trionycis were able to protect liver against fibrosis in CCl4 animal models. AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study is to verify the inhibitory effect and the underlying mechanisms of Carapax Trionycis extract peptide (CTEP) on activated hepatic stellate cells which play a central role in liver fibrogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hepatic stellate cells induced by TGF-Î²1 were applied to evaluate the anti-fibrotic effect of CTEP in vitro. MTS assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and western blotting were then used to further investigate the molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: The results show that the contents of collagen I, collagen III and TIMP-1 were significantly inhibited and the level of collagen I, collagen III, p-Smad 3, TIMP-1 and Î±-SMA proteins decreased significantly in a concentration-dependence manner after treatment with CTEP. Interestingly, the level of Smad 3 protein was not different significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that CTEP efficiently inhibits cultured HSC-T6 cell activation and proliferation via the TGF-Î²1/Smad pathway as well as by the elimination of the extracellular matrix.
23612487	CHEMICALIN promotes the nuclear translocation of GENEIN and thereby induces GENEIN gene expression in osteoblast-like cell lines. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a well-known signaling CHEMICALNOTIN and bioactive lipid mediator. Recently, it was reported that CHEMICALNOTIN inhibits osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption. On the other hand, CHEMICALNOTIN effects on osteoblasts and bone formation are little known. In this study, we investigated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on osteoblasts, using two osteoblast-like cell lines, SaOS-2 and MC3T3-E1. CHEMICALIN activated GENEIN (GENEIN)/GENEIN signaling, leading to the inhibition of GENEIN and the nuclear translocation of GENEIN, followed by the increase of the transcriptional activity by GENEIN/GENEIN complex formation in both SaOS-2 cells and MC3T3-E1 cells. The inhibitors of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN suppressed CHEMICALIN-induced nuclear localization of GENEIN. We further investigated the effects of GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling on the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling pathway, since GENENOTIN takes a central role in this signaling pathway. Both inhibitors for GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN suppressed the nuclear localization of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN transcriptional activity induced by GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN increased the amount of GENEIN at both mRNA and protein levels, and increased the activity of GENENOTIN, leading to the mineralization. These findings suggest that CHEMICALIN activates the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway leading to the promotion of nuclear translocation of GENEIN in osteoblast-like cells, resulting in the upregulation of GENEIN and osteoblast differentiation markers including GENEIN, probably relating to the inhibition of osteoclast formation and the mineralization, respectively.
18847313	CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN antagonist for the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. Stem cells harvested from peripheral blood are the most commonly used graft source in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. While GENENOTIN is the most frequently used agent for stem cell mobilization, the use of GENENOTIN alone results in suboptimal stem cell yields in a significant proportion of patients undergoing autologous transplantation. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, Genzyme Corporation) is a CHEMICALIN molecule that antagonizes the binding of the GENEIN GENEIN (GENEIN) to its cognate receptor GENEIN. CHEMICALNOTIN results in the rapid and reversible mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells into the peripheral circulation and is synergistic when combined with GENENOTIN. In clinical studies of autologous stem cell transplantation, the combination of CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN allows the collection of large numbers of stem cells in fewer apheresis sessions and can salvage those who fail GENENOTIN mobilization alone.
23164618	Supra-normal stimulation of dopamine D1 receptors in the prelimbic cortex blocks behavioral expression of both aversive and rewarding associative memories through a cyclic-AMP-dependent signaling pathway. Dopamine (DA) receptor transmission through either D(1) or D(2)-like subtypes is involved critically in the processing of emotional information within the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). However the functional role of specific DA D(1)-like receptor transmission in the expression of emotionally salient associative memories (either aversive or rewarding) is not currently understood. Here we demonstrate that specific activation of DA D(1) receptors in the prelimbic (PLC) division of the mPFC causes a transient block in the behavioral expression of both aversive and rewarding associative memories. We report that intra-PLC microinfusions of a selective D(1) receptor agonist block the spontaneous expression of an associative olfactory fear memory, without altering the stability of the original memory trace. Furthermore, using an unbiased place conditioning procedure (CPP), intra-PLC D(1) receptor activation blocks the spontaneous expression of an associative morphine (5Â mg/kg; i.p.) reward memory, while leaving morphine-primed memory expression intact. Interestingly, both intra-PLC D(1)-receptor mediated block of either fear-related or reward-related associative memories were dependent upon downstream cyclic-AMP (cAMP) signaling as both effects were rescued by co-administration of a cAMP signaling inhibitor. The blockade of both rewarding and aversive associative memories is mediated through a D(1)-specific signaling pathway, asÂ neither forms of spontaneous memory expression were blocked by intra-PLC microinfusions of a D(2)-like receptor agonist. Our results demonstrate that the spontaneous expression of either rewarding orÂ aversive emotionally salient memories shares a common, D(1)-receptor mediated substrate within theÂ mPFC.
23183186	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mediates the cross talk between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN gene expression and its ablation affects CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis in male C57BL/6 mice. In gut endocrine L cells, the GENENOTIN signaling pathway effector GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)/GENENOTIN mediates the stimulatory effect of GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expression and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) production. In several other cell lineages, GENENOTIN is able to stimulate GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Here we determined the role of GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN expression and the effect of GENENOTIN deletion on CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis. GENENOTIN stimulated GENEIN activation through increasing its CHEMICALIN423 phosphorylation in gut GENENOTIN-expressing cell lines, associated with increased GENENOTIN mRNA levels. This stimulation was attenuated by the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) or dominant-negative GENENOTIN. Both GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-promoting agents activated Î²-cat CHEMICALNOTIN675 phosphorylation, which was attenuated by IPA3 or GENENOTIN inhibition, respectively. Gut GENENOTIN levels were reduced in male GENENOTIN(-/-) mice, associated with impaired CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance after an ip or oral CHEMICALNOTIN challenge. These mice had lower circulating active GENENOTIN levels after a CHEMICALNOTIN challenge as well as reduced distal ileum GENENOTIN content after insulin treatment. Finally, the GENENOTIN(-/-) mice exhibited reduced brainstem gcg level and abolished GENEIN CHEMICALIN675 phosphorylation in brain neurons after GENENOTIN treatment. We suggest that GENENOTIN mediates the cross talk between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN signaling pathways on gut and brain GENENOTIN expression, and its ablation impairs CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis.
17018843	Characterization of the regulation of GENENOTIN GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN are widely distributed in the kidney and affect multiple aspects of renal function. In the proximal tubule, GENENOTIN regulates volume and acid-base regulation through stimulation of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN. This paper characterizes the signaling pathway by which GENENOTIN stimulates GENENOTIN in a cell culture model [opossum kidney (OK) cell]. GENENOTIN has two distinct phases of action on GENENOTIN. Chronic GENENOTIN (24 h) activates GENENOTIN through the classic GENEIN-GENENOTIN (GENEIN-GENENOTIN) pathway as GENENOTIN stimulates GENENOTIN phosphorylation and the GENENOTIN effect can be blocked by the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN or a dominant-negative GENENOTIN. We showed that GENENOTIN transcript and protein are expressed in rat proximal tubule and OK cells. We previously showed that glucocorticoids augment the effect of GENENOTIN on GENENOTIN (Klisic J, Hu MC, Nief V, Reyes L, Fuster D, Moe OW, Ambuhl PM. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 283: F532-F539, 2002). Part of this can be mediated via induction of GENENOTIN by glucocorticoids, and indeed the GENENOTIN effect on GENENOTIN can also be amplified by overexpression of GENENOTIN. We next addressed the acute effect of GENENOTIN (1-2 h) on GENENOTIN by systematically examining the candidate signaling cascades and activation mechanisms of GENENOTIN. We ruled out the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN pathways, increased surface GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN phosphorylation, GENENOTIN association with GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN as mechanisms of acute activation of GENENOTIN by GENENOTIN. In summary, GENENOTIN stimulates GENENOTIN acutely via yet undefined pathways and mechanisms. The chronic effect of GENENOTIN is mediated by the classic GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN route.
17067304	The effects of adulthood CHEMICALNOTIN treatment on cognitive performance and GENEIN content in male and female rats neonatally treated with CHEMICALIN. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats were administered CHEMICALNOTIN (1 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline once daily from postnatal day (P)1 to P21. This drug treatment has been shown to produce long-term priming of the GENENOTIN. Beginning on P62, rats were administered the atypical antipsychotic CHEMICALNOTIN (2.5 mg/kg) or saline twice daily (i.p.) for 28 days. One day after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment ceased, rats were tested on the place and match-to-place versions of the Morris water maze (MWM) for seven consecutive days. GENENOTIN priming was verified through a yawning behavioural test, a GENENOTIN-mediated event, before CHEMICALNOTIN was administered as well as after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment and behavioural testing were complete. Results showed that neonatal CHEMICALIN treatment induced GENEIN priming that was eliminated by CHEMICALIN treatment. On the MWM place version, GENENOTIN-primed rats demonstrated a significant impairment that was eliminated by CHEMICALNOTIN treatment, but CHEMICALNOTIN treatment to animals neonatally treated with saline produced a significant deficit on the place version of the MWM. There were no significant deficits on the match-to-place version. Brain tissue analyses revealed that neonatal CHEMICALIN treatment produced a significant decrease in hippocampal GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN that was eliminated by CHEMICALIN treatment. Neonatal CHEMICALIN treatment produced a significant decrease in GENEIN and GENEIN in the frontal cortex that was unaffected by CHEMICALIN treatment. These results show that CHEMICALIN eliminates GENEIN priming and cognitive impairment and also alleviates decreases in neurotrophins and acetylcholinergic markers produced by GENENOTIN priming in the hippocampus.
23397359	Temperature Effects of Sputtering of Langmuir-Blodgett Multilayers. Time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) are employed to characterize a wedge-shaped crater eroded by a 40 keV C(60) (+) cluster ion beam on an organic thin film of 402 nm of barium arachidate (AA) multilayers prepared by the Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) technique. Sample cooling to 90 K was used to help reduce chemical damage, improve depth resolution and maintain constant erosion rate during depth profiling. The film was characterized at 90 K, 135 K, 165 K, 205 K, 265 K and 300 K. It is shown that sample cooling to 205 K or lower helps to inhibit erosion rate decay, whereas at 300 K and 265 K the erosion rate continues to drop after 250 nm of erosion, reaching about half of the initial value after removal of the entire film. Depth profiles are acquired from the SIMS images of the eroded wedge crater. The results suggest that sample cooling only slightly improves the altered layer thickness, but eliminates the decrease in erosion rate observed above 265 K.
23249626	An engineered GENENOTIN variant: insights into the pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic relationships of a novel molecule with broad therapeutic potential. GENENOTIN is a regulatory glycoprotein with widespread biologic functions, including antiinflammatory activities, wound-healing properties, and muscle-stimulating effects. The role of GENENOTIN in a wide range of biologic activities shows promise for potential clinical application, which has prompted considerable interest in the investigation of the protein as a potential disease-modifying agent. In spite of this potential, the development of GENENOTIN as a broad use biotherapeutic has been severely hindered by a poor understanding and characterization of its pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships. Therefore, to better define these relationships, we performed in-depth analyses of the PK/PD relationships of native GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Our data indicate that the intrinsic PK/PD properties of native GENENOTIN are poorly suited for acting as a parentally administered biotherapeutic with broad systemic effects. Here, we leveraged protein engineering to modify the PK characteristics of the native molecule by fusing GENENOTIN to a GENENOTIN and removing the intrinsic heparan CHEMICALIN-binding activity of GENEIN. The engineered variant molecule had ~100- and ~1600-fold improvements in terminal half-life and exposure, respectively. In contrast to the native GENENOTIN, the variant showed a robust, dose-dependent pharmacological effect when administered subcutaneously on a weekly basis in mouse models of muscle atrophy and degeneration. These studies highlight the underappreciated and critical relationship between optimizing multiple physical and chemical properties of GENENOTIN on its overall PK/PD profile. Moreover, our findings provide the first documented strategy toward the development of a GENENOTIN therapeutic with potential use in patients affected with skeletal muscle diseases.
23333577	Suppression of GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN signaling by CHEMICALIN inhibits the growth of human colorectal cancer cells. CHEMICALNOTIN, a naturally occurring CHEMICALNOTIN mainly found in Pinus species, has exhibited a potential cancer chemopreventive activity. However, the growth inhibitory activity against cancer cells and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Therefore, the anti-proliferative activity of CHEMICALNOTIN was investigated in human colorectal HCT 116 cancer cells. CHEMICALIN inhibited the proliferation of HCT 116 cells by arresting transition of cell cycle from G1 to S phase along with the downregulation of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN), GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN (GENEIN), and the upregulation of GENEIN(GENEIN/GENEIN) and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN was also found to attenuate the activation of proteins involved in fGENEIN (GENEIN)/GENEIN/GENEIN (GENEIN) signaling, and GENEIN (GENEIN)/GENEIN/ GENEIN (GENEIN) signaling pathway. Subsequently, CHEMICALIN suppressed the nuclear translocation of GENEIN, one of downstream molecules of GENEIN/GENEIN/GENEIN signaling, and these events led to the sequential downregulation of GENEIN-mediated transcription of target genes including GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. These findings demonstrate that the anti-proliferative activity of CHEMICALNOTIN might be associated with the cell cycle arrest and downregulation of cell proliferation regulating signaling pathways in human colorectal cancer cells.
23434647	The Interaction of Adrenomedullin and Macrophages Induces Ovarian Cancer Cell Migration via Activation of RhoA Signaling Pathway. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are correlated with poor prognosis in many human cancers; however, the mechanism by which TAMs facilitate ovarian cancer cell migration and invasion remains unknown. This study was aimed to examine the function of adrenomedullin (ADM) in macrophage polarization and their further effects on the migration of ovarian cancer cells. Exogenous ADM antagonist and small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific for ADM expression were treated to macrophages and EOC cell line HO8910, respectively. Then macrophages were cocultured with HO8910 cells without direct contact. Flow cytometry, Western blot and real-time PCR were used to detect macrophage phenotype and cytokine production. The migration ability and cytoskeleton rearrangement of ovarian cancer cells were determined by Transwell migration assay and phalloidin staining. Western blot was performed to evaluate the activity status of signaling molecules in the process of ovarian cancer cell migration. The results showed that ADM induced macrophage phenotype and cytokine production similar to TAMs. Macrophages polarized by ADM promoted the migration and cytoskeleton rearrangement of HO8910 cells. The expression of RhoA and its downstream effector, cofilin, were upregulated in macrophage-induced migration of HO8910 cells. In conclusion, ADM could polarize macrophages similar to TAMs, and then polarized macrophages promote the migration of ovarian cancer cells via activation of RhoA signaling pathway in vitro.
23265543	Influence of CHEMICALNOTIN supply on the production of higher CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN and expression of flavour-related genes in cachaÃ§a fermentation. This study provides the first attempt to analyse the influence of CHEMICALNOTIN supplements on CHEMICALNOTIN-cane juice fermentation and the flavour profile in a cachaÃ§a industrial process. The objective was to find a relationship between higher CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN content and the transcription levels of the main genes involved in production of these compounds under cachaÃ§a fermentation. CHEMICALNOTIN-cane juice with a low amount of assimilable CHEMICALNOTIN (81 mg N/L), was further supplemented with mid-range or high concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN. Overall, higher CHEMICALNOTIN production was reduced by CHEMICALIN supplementation, and this can be correlated with a general downregulation of genes encoding GENEIN and GENEIN of the GENEIN. The production of CHEMICALNOTIN was enhanced by mid-range CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation and the production of CHEMICALNOTIN by high CHEMICALNOTIN supplementation. The CHEMICALIN could be correlated with expression of GENEIN and the GENEIN.
23534442	Novel analgesic/anti-inflammatory agents: CHEMICALIN and related compounds as GENEIN inhibiting CHEMICALIN donors. A series of CHEMICALNOTIN bearing a CHEMICALNOTIN side chain linked to different spacers were designed. New classes of CHEMICALIN-derived CHEMICALIN inverse CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN (7-10) as GENEIN selective inhibitors and CHEMICALNOTIN donors were synthesized and are herein reported. By taking into account the metabolic conversion of CHEMICALNOTIN (9, 10) into corresponding CHEMICALNOTIN, derivatives 17 and 18 were also studied. CHEMICALIN derivatives showed CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent vasorelaxing properties, while most of the compounds proved to be very potent and selective GENEIN inhibitors in in vitro experimental models. Further in vivo studies on compounds 9a,c and 17a highlighted good anti-inflammatory and antinociceptive activities. Compound 9c was able to inhibit glycosaminoglycan (GAG) release induced by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), showing cartilage protective properties. Finally, molecular modeling and CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN-NMR studies performed on compounds 6c,d, 9c, and 10b allowed the right conformation of CHEMICALIN side chain of these molecules within the GENEIN active site to be assessed.
12184062	The clinical profile of the GENEIN blocker CHEMICALIN. GENENOTIN antagonists block GENEIN and reduce the pressor effects of CHEMICALIN in the vasculature. By this mechanism, they induce similar pharmacological effects to GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) inhibitors, resulting in a lowering of blood pressure (BP). However, GENENOTIN antagonists differ from GENENOTIN inhibitors with respect to side effects, and induce less cough, which is related to GENENOTIN activation. Within the class of CHEMICALNOTIN antagonists, eprosartan differs from other currently clinically available agents in terms of its chemical structure and its dual pharmacological mode of action. CHEMICALIN acts not only at vascular GENEIN receptors but also at presynaptic GENEIN receptors, causing inhibition of sympathetically stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN release. CHEMICALIN is not metabolized by GENEIN enzymes and therefore has a low potential for metabolic drug interactions, which may be of importance when treating the elderly and patients on multiple drugs. In clinical trials CHEMICALIN has proven to be at least as effective as the GENEIN inhibitor enalapril in reducing BP, but with a significantly lower incidence of side effects. CHEMICALNOTIN is safe, effective and well tolerated in long-term treatment, either as monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensive drugs such as CHEMICALNOTIN.
22815248	Protective Effects of a Purified CHEMICALNOTIN Mixture from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., in vivo Hepatotoxicity Models. In this study, the in vivo effects of a purified CHEMICALNOTIN mixture (PSM), obtained from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., were investigated using two in vivo hepatotoxicity models based on liver damage caused by CHEMICALNOTIN (PC) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN ). The effects of PSM were compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. Male Wistar rats were challenged orally with 20% CHEMICALNOTIN or PC (2 g/kg) four days after being pre-treated with PSM (100 mg/kg) or CHEMICALNOTIN (200 mg/kg). A significant decrease of GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN (GENEIN) activities and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) levels and an increase of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) quantity was observed after CHEMICALIN and PC administration alone. PSM pre-treatment decreased GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activities and CHEMICALNOTIN levels and increased the levels of cell protector CHEMICALNOTIN. Biotransformation phase I enzymes were also assessed in both models. In the CHEMICALNOTIN hepatotoxicity model, pre-treatment with PSM or CHEMICALIN resulted in significantly increased activities of GENEIN and GENEIN activity and GENEIN, compared to the CHEMICALIN only group. Neither CHEMICALNOTIN nor PSM influenced PC biotransformation. Our results suggest that PSM, obtained from A. corniculatus, Bieb. showed in vivo hepatoprotective and antioxidant activities against CHEMICALNOTIN and PC-induced liver damage comparable to that of CHEMICALNOTIN.

15114505	In vitro inhibition of GENEIN by CHEMICALIN from Sophora flavescens. Four CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN ( 1), a CHEMICALIN of 1, CHEMICALIN ( 2), CHEMICALIN ( 3), CHEMICALIN ( 4) and CHEMICALIN ( 5) isolated from the roots of Sophora flavescens were investigated for their inhibitory effects on GENEIN (GENEIN). The CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN activity in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 10.9 microM ( 1), 9.8 microM ( 2), 8.6 microM ( 3), 142.0 microM ( 4) and 250 microM ( 5). The CHEMICALNOTIN without CHEMICALNOTIN ( 1, 2, 3) showed stronger inhibition than those with CHEMICALNOTIN ( 4, 5). On the other hand, CHEMICALNOTIN without side chains (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) did not inhibit the enzyme activity at a final concentration of 800 microM. These data suggest that the CHEMICALIN side chain and the position of the CHEMICALIN group are important for high GENEIN inhibitory activity. Compound 1 also inhibited de novo synthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in Raji cells.
17494951	GENENOTIN stimulates the expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN mRNA by equine pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Little is known concerning the possible contribution of T helper 2 (Th2)-type GENENOTIN to the recruitment of neutrophils into the lung tissue. In the present study, endothelial cells from equine pulmonary arteries were cultured in the presence of recombinant GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and the GENENOTIN mRNA expression of molecules implicated in the chemotaxis and migration of neutrophils was studied using real-time RT-PCR. The functional response of GENENOTIN-induced endothelial cell stimulation on neutrophil migration was also studied using a chemotaxis chamber. GENENOTIN either increased the expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), or potentiated the coeffects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) on GENENOTIN. Supernatants collected from cultured endothelial cells stimulated with GENENOTIN significantly promoted neutrophil migration in a dose-dependent manner. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) decreased the expression of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN induced by GENENOTIN, while CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a selective inhibitor of GENEIN, decreased the expression of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN attenuated the mRNA expression of GENEIN and GENEIN induced by the costimulation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and LPS. Neither GENENOTIN influenced the mRNA expression of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, or GENENOTIN. These findings suggest that Th2-type GENENOTIN may contribute to pulmonary neutrophilia during allergic inflammation by the increased expression of neutrophil GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN by endothelial cells. CHEMICALNOTIN and the GENENOTIN inhibitors may decrease pulmonary neutrophilia due, in part, to a direct inhibition of some of these factors.
23330847	Hydroxy-terminated conjugated polymer nanoparticles have near-unity bright fraction and reveal cholesterol-dependence of IGF1R nanodomains. Fluorescent nanoparticles have enabled many discoveries regarding how molecular machines function. Quantum dots have been the dominant class of fluorescent nanoparticles but suffer from blinking and from a substantial dark fraction--particles where the fluorescence is never seen--complicating any analysis of biological function. Nanoparticles composed of conjugated fluorescent polymers (Pdots) have recently been shown to have high brightness and no blinking. Here we develop a robust and efficient means to measure the dark fraction of Pdots, conjugating Atto dyes to the nanoparticles and testing fluorescence colocalization of dye and Pdot puncta. This established that the Pdots we generated had minimal dark fraction: â¼3%. The application of nanoparticles in biological environments is highly sensitive to surface functionalization. For Pdots we found that passivation with uncharged hydroxy-terminated polyethylene glycol caused a dramatic reduction in nonspecific cell binding and aggregation compared to a charged coating. Using carbonyl di-imidazole the hydroxy-Pdots were functionalized efficiently with streptavidin for high stability targeting, allowing specific labeling of mammalian cells. Type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF1R) regulates cell survival and development, with roles in aging, heart disease, and cancer. We used hydroxy-Pdots to track the dynamics of IGF1R on a breast cancer cell-line, determining the diffusion characteristics and showing cholesterol-containing membrane nanodomains were important for receptor mobility at the plasma membrane. The near-unity bright fraction and low nonspecific binding of hydroxy-Pdots, combined with Pdot photostability and lack of blinking, provides many advantages for investigations at the single molecule level.
17000933	CHEMICALNOTIN but not CHEMICALNOTIN ablates the protective function of CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN salt-treated rats. Controversial results obtained from human and animal studies on the prevention of heart disease by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN warrant a better understanding of GENENOTIN function and interaction. To address this issue and taking into account that effects of synthetic CHEMICALIN are not only referable to action through the GENEIN but may also be mediated by other GENEIN, we characterized cardiovascular function and inflammatory gene expression in CHEMICALNOTIN salt-treated rats on long-term administration of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, a new CHEMICALNOTIN exhibiting antimineralocorticoid activity. The complex pattern of cardiovascular injury in ovariectomized Wistar rats induced by chronic CHEMICALNOTIN infusion plus a high-salt diet was significantly attenuated in sham-ovariectomized rats and by coadministration of CHEMICALNOTIN in ovariectomized animals after 8 weeks of continuous treatment. The beneficial role of CHEMICALIN on blood pressure, cardiac hypertrophy, vascular GENEIN expression, perivascular fibrosis, and impaired CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent relaxation of isolated aortic rings was completely abrogated by coadministration of CHEMICALIN. In contrast, CHEMICALNOTIN was either neutral or additive to CHEMICALNOTIN in protecting against CHEMICALNOTIN salt-induced cardiovascular injury and inflammation. The current results support the hypothesis of complex interactions among GENENOTIN signaling in cardiovascular injury and inflammation. Novel CHEMICALNOTIN, such as CHEMICALNOTIN, confer superior effects compared with CHEMICALNOTIN in a model of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced heart disease because of its antimineralocorticoid properties.
23007555	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN GENENOTIN gating. CHEMICALIN is an allosteric inhibitor of GENEIN/GENEIN GENEIN. Despite its widespread use as a prototype for drug development and a subtype-selective tool for physiologic experiments, its precise effect on GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN gating is yet to be fully understood. Interestingly, recent crystallographic evidence identified that CHEMICALIN unlike CHEMICALNOTIN, binds at the interface of the GENEIN/GENEIN CHEMICALIN terminal domain dimer by an induced-fit mechanism. To delineate the effect of this unique binding on GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN receptor gating, we recorded steady-state currents from cell-attached and outside-out patches. At pH 7.9 in cell-attached patches, CHEMICALNOTIN increased the occupancy of the long-lived shut conformations, thereby reducing the open probability of the receptor with no change in the mean open time. In addition, CHEMICALNOTIN selectively affected the area of shut time constants, but not the time constants themselves. Kinetic analyses suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN prevents the transition of the receptor to an open state and increases its dwell time in an intrinsically occurring closed conformation or desensitized state. We found distinct differences in the action of CHEMICALIN at GENEIN/GENEIN in comparison with previous studies on the effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN/GENEIN gating, which may arise due to their unique binding sites. Our data also uncover the potential pH-dependent action of CHEMICALNOTIN on gating. At a low pH (pH 7.4), but not pH 7.9, CHEMICALIN reduces the mean open time of GENEIN/GENEIN receptors, which may be responsible for its usefulness as a context-dependent inhibitor in conditions like ischemia and stroke, when the pH of the extracellular milieu becomes acidic.
23557706	GENENOTIN Regulates GENENOTIN-Mediated Podocyte Depletion in Diabetic Renal Injury. Podocyte apoptosis is a critical mechanism for excessive loss of urinary GENENOTIN that eventuates in kidney fibrosis. Pharmacological doses of the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN reduce albuminura in diabetes. We explored the hypothesis that GENENOTIN mediates podocyte injury in diabetes. High CHEMICALIN (HG) induces apoptosis of podocytes, inhibits GENEIN activation, inactivates GENEIN and activates GENEIN. HG also increases the levels of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activity. Inhibition of GENEIN by low dose CHEMICALIN decreases HG-induced GENEIN and GENEIN, GENEIN activity and podocyte apoptosis. Inhibition of GENENOTIN had no effect on GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN phosphorylation indicating that GENENOTIN is downstream of these signaling molecules. In isolated glomeruli of OVE26 mice, there is similar decrease in the activation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN and activation of GENENOTIN with increase in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN activity. Inhibition of GENEIN by small dose of CHEMICALIN reduces podocyte apoptosis, attenuates glomerular injury and albuminuria. Our data provide evidence for a novel function of GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN-derived ROS generation and podocyte apoptosis that contributes to urinary GENENOTIN excretion in type 1 diabetes. Thus GENENOTIN and or GENENOTIN inhibition may represent a therapeutic modality of diabetic kidney disease.
23641685	Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy of the Hydroxy-Methyl-Peroxy Radical. We report vibrational and electronic spectra of the hydroxyl-methyl-peroxy radical (HOCH2OO, or HMP), the primary product of the reaction of the hydroperoxy radical, HO2, and formaldehyde, HCHO. The Î½1 vibrational (OH stretch) spectrum and the Ã-X electronic spectrum of HMP were detected by Infrared Cavity Ringdown Spectroscopy (IR-CRDS), and assignments were verified with density functional calculations. The HMP radical was generated in reactions of HCHO with HO2. Free radical reactions were initiated by pulsed laser photolysis (PLP) of Cl2 in the presence of HCHO and O2 in a flow reactor at 300-330 Torr and 295K. IR-CRDS spectra were measured in mid-IR and near-IR regions over the ranges 3525-3700 cm(-1) (Î½1) and 7250-7800 cm(-1) (Ã-X) (respectively, at a delay time 100 Âµs after photolysis. The Î½1 spectrum had an origin at 3622 cm(-1) and exhibited partially resolved P- and R-branch contours and a small Q branch. At these short delay times, spectral interference from HOOH and HCOOH was minimal, and could be subtracted. From B3LYP/6-31G+(d,p) calculations, we found that the anharmonic vibrational frequency and band contour predicted for the lowest energy conformer, HMP-A, The calculated anharmonic vibrational frequency and band contour computed using B3LYP/63-1G(d,p) level were in good agreement with the observed spectrum. In the near-IR, we observed four well spaced vibronic bands, each with partially resolved rotational contours. We assigned the apparent origin of the electronic spectrum of HMP at 7392 cm(-1) and two bands to the blue to a progression in Î½15', the lowest torsional mode of the state (Î½15'= 171 cm(-1)). The band furthest to the red was assigned as a hot band in Î½15", leading to a ground state torsional frequency of (Î½15"= 122 cm(-1)). We simulated the spectrum using second order vibrational perturbation theory (VPT2) with B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) calculations at the minimum energy geometries of the HMP-A conformer on the X Ì and A Ì states. The predictions of the electronic origin frequency, torsional frequencies, anharmonicities and rotational band contours matched the observed spectrum. We investigated the torsional modes more explicitly by computing potential energy surfaces of HMP as a function of the two dihedral angles ÏOCOH and ÏOOCO. Wave functions and energy levels were calculated based on this potential surface; these results were used to calculate the Franck-Condon factors, which reproduced the vibronic band intensities in the observed electronic spectrum. The transitions that we observed all involved states with wave functions localized on the minimum energy conformer, HMP-A. Our calculations indicated that the observed near-IR spectrum was that of the minimum energy conformer HMP-A, but that this conformer is not the lowest energy conformer in the state, which remains unobserved. We estimated that the energy of this lowest conformer (HMP-B) of the Ã state to be T0 (Ã) â 7200 cm(-1), based on the energy difference E0(HMP-B) - E0(HMP-A) on the Ã state computed at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level.
16432501	Systemic administration of GENEIN agonists, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, elicit skeletal muscle hypertrophy in rats at micromolar doses. GENENOTIN agonists provide a potential therapy for muscle wasting and weakness, but their use may be limited by adverse effects on the heart, mediated in part, by GENENOTIN activation. Two beta(2)-agonists, CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, are approved for treating asthma and have an extended duration of action and increased safety, associated with greater GENEIN selectivity. The pharmacological profiles of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN and their effects on skeletal and cardiac muscle mass were investigated in 12-week-old, male F344 rats. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were each administered via daily i.p. injection at one of seven doses (ranging from 1 to 2,000 microg kg(-1) day(-1)), for 4 weeks. Rats were anaesthetised and the EDL and soleus muscles and the heart were excised and weighed. Dose-response curves were constructed based on skeletal and cardiac muscle hypertrophy. CHEMICALNOTIN was more potent than CHEMICALNOTIN, with a significantly lower ED(50) in EDL muscles (1 and 130 microg kg(-1) day(-1), P <0.05), whereas CHEMICALNOTIN had greater intrinsic activity than CHEMICALNOTIN in both EDL and soleus muscles (12% greater hypertrophy than CHEMICALNOTIN). The drugs had similar potency and intrinsic activity in the heart, with a smaller leftward shift for CHEMICALNOTIN than seen in skeletal muscle. A dose of 25 microg kg(-1) day(-1) of CHEMICALIN elicited greater EDL and soleus hypertrophy than CHEMICALIN, but resulted in similar GENEIN downregulation. These results show that doses as low as 1 microg kg(-1) day(-1) of CHEMICALNOTIN can elicit significant muscle hypertrophy with minimal cardiac hypertrophy and provide important information regarding the potential therapeutic use of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN for muscle wasting.
19275550	Clinical utility of CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN inhibitor in cardiometabolic disorders. Diabetes is associated with an increase risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Recently, macrovascular complications of diabetes have been shown to start before the development of diabetes. Indeed, several clinical studies have confirmed the increased risk of CVD in patients with impaired CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance (IGT). Since postprandial hyperglycemia and GENENOTIN resistance are thought to play a central role in the development and progression of CVD in patients with IGT, amelioration of postprandial hyperglycemia as well as GENENOTIN resistance is a therapeutic target for the prevention of CVD in these high-risk patients. CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN inhibitor, delays the absorption of CHEMICALNOTIN from the small intestine, thereby reducing postprandial hyperglycemia. Further, recently, CHEMICALNOTIN. These findings suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN is a promising metabolic modifier that could reduce the risk of CVD in patients with the metabolic syndrome. In this paper, we review the clinical utility of CHEMICALNOTIN in various cardiometabolic disorders.
23402841	Hematologic and hepatic responses of the freshwater fish Hoplias malabaricus after CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. The bioaccumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in the trophic chain, mainly in freshwater, are not completely known. This work aimed to elucidate the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on Hoplias malabaricus through trophic bioassay. The fish were fed once every five days with Astyanax sp. before being subjected to an intraperitoneal inoculation with the lysate of Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii culture containing 97% CHEMICALNOTIN and 3% by CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN during 20 days. The animal's liver was assessed using biomarkers as activities of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and lipoperoxidation (LPO) and protein carbonylation (PCO). In the blood was analyzed the genotoxic and hematological parameters. The hepatosomatic index and the relative condition factor did not show a significant difference between the exposed and control groups. The values of mean corpuscular GENEIN concentration and mean corpuscular GENEIN increased in the CHEMICALIN group. The hepatic tissue from both groups exhibited a typical pattern that have been already described for most teleost fish. The results suggested the generation of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species, with increased activity of GENENOTIN and concentrations of LPO and CHEMICALNOTIN; whereas the specific activity of GENENOTIN decreased. However, no changes were observed in the GENENOTIN, PCO, and DNA damage. Although the CHEMICALNOTIN effects are known as neurotoxic, this cyanotoxin caused liver biochemical alterations that can be considered ecologically relevant.
23531536	The Protective Effects of Î±-Lipoic Acid on Kidneys in Type 2 Diabetic Goto-Kakisaki Rats via Reducing Oxidative Stress. To evaluate the protective effects of Î±-lipoic acid on the kidneys of Goto-Kakisaki (GK) diabetic rats, ten GK diabetic rats were randomly divided into a diabetic control group and a lipoic acid-treated diabetic group with Î±-lipoic acid 35 mgÂ·Kg-1 intraperitoneal injections. Four healthy Wistar rats served as normal controls. Malonaldehyde (MDA), ascorbic acid (vitamin C), vitamin E, glutathione (GSH) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) levels in renal homogenate, and urine protein excretion were measured. The expression of mRNA for NF-ÎºB, NADPH oxidase subunits p22phox and p47phox in renal tissue was examined by realtime PCR. Pathological changes in renal tissue were evaluated by light and electron microscopy. There were significant increases in urine protein excretion, MDA levels and the expression of mRNA of NF-ÎºB, p22phox and p47phox, and significant decreases in GSH, SOD, vitamin C and vitamin E levels in the diabetic control group compared with the normal control group. Pathological changes of renal tissue were more progressive in the diabetic control group than in the normal control group. All the parameters above were improved in the Î±-lipoic acid-treated diabetic group. Oxidative stress is increased in the kidney of type 2 diabetic GK rats. It is associated with the progression of diabetic nephropathy. Î±-lipoic acid can protect renal function in diabetic rats via its antioxidant activity.
23287538	Alcohol intoxications during adolescence increase motivation for alcohol in adult rats and induce neuroadaptations in the nucleus accumbens. Adolescent alcohol binge drinking constitutes a major vulnerability factor to develop alcoholism. However, mechanisms underlying this susceptibility remain unknown. We evaluated the effect of adolescent binge-like ethanol intoxication on vulnerability to alcohol abuse in Sprague-Dawley rats. To model binge-like ethanol intoxication, every 2 days, rats received an ethanol injection (3.0Â g/kg) for 2 consecutive days across 14 days either from postnatal day 30 (PND30) to 43 (early adolescence) or from PND 45 to PND 58 (late adolescence). In young adult animals, we measured free ethanol consumption in the two-bottle choice paradigm, motivation for ethanol in the operant self-administration task and both ethanol's rewarding and aversive properties in the conditioned place preference (CPP) and taste aversion (CTA) paradigms. While intermittent ethanol intoxications (IEI) during late adolescence had no effect on free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, we found that IEI during early adolescence promoted free-choice 10% ethanol consumption, enhanced motivation for ethanol in the self-administration paradigm and induced a loss of both ethanol-induced CPP and CTA in young adults. No modification in either sucrose self-administration or amphetamine-induced CPP was observed. As the nucleus accumbens (Nac) is particularly involved in addictive behavior, we analyzed IEI-induced long-term neuroadaptations in the Nac using c-Fos immunohistochemistry and an array of neurotransmission-related genes. This vulnerability to ethanol abuse was associated with a lower c-Fos immunoreactivity in the Nac and enduring alterations of the expression of Penk and Slc6a4, 2 neurotransmission-related genes that have been shown to play critical roles in the behavioral effects of ethanol and alcoholism.
23160530	Gliotransmission and brain CHEMICALNOTIN sensing: critical role of GENENOTIN. Hypothalamic CHEMICALNOTIN sensing is involved in the control of feeding behavior and peripheral CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis, and glial cells are suggested to play an important role in this process. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and its processing product the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), collectively named GENENOTIN, are secreted by astroglia, and GENENOTIN is a potent anorexigenic factor. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of endozepines in brain CHEMICALNOTIN sensing. First, we showed that intracerebroventricular administration of CHEMICALIN in rats increases GENEIN expression in hypothalamic glial-like tanycytes. We then demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN stimulates endozepine secretion from hypothalamic explants. Feeding experiments indicate that the anorexigenic effect of central administration of CHEMICALNOTIN was blunted by coinjection of an GENENOTIN antagonist. Conversely, the hyperphagic response elicited by central glucoprivation was suppressed by an GENENOTIN agonist. The anorexigenic effects of centrally injected CHEMICALNOTIN or GENENOTIN agonist were suppressed by blockade of the GENENOTIN, suggesting that CHEMICALNOTIN sensing involves endozepinergic control of the GENENOTIN pathway. Finally, we found that brain GENENOTIN modulate blood CHEMICALNOTIN levels, suggesting their involvement in a feedback loop controlling whole-body CHEMICALNOTIN homeostasis. Collectively, these data indicate that GENENOTIN are a critical relay in brain CHEMICALNOTIN sensing and potentially new targets in treatment of metabolic disorders.
10411647	GENEIN binds CHEMICALIN cofactor with negative cooperativity, as shown by kinetic analyses and surface plasmon resonance detection. Kinetic studies of tetrameric recombinant GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) have revealed properties so far not reported for this enzyme. Firstly, with the natural cofactor CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) a time-dependent change (burst) in enzyme activity was observed, with a half-time of about 20 s for the kinetic transient. Secondly, nonhyperbolic saturation behaviour was found for CHEMICALNOTIN with a pronounced negative cooperativity (0.39 < h < 0.58; [S]0.5 = 24 +/- 4 microM). On phosphorylation of CHEMICALIN by GENEIN, the affinity for CHEMICALIN increased ([S]0.5 = 11 +/- 2 microM) and the negative cooperativity was amplified (h = 0.27 +/- 0.03). The dimeric CHEMICALIN-terminal deletion mutant (Delta473-528) of GENEIN also showed negative cooperativity of CHEMICALIN binding (h = 0.4). Cooperativity was not observed with the cofactor analogues CHEMICALNOTIN (h = 0.9 +/- 0.1; Km = 62.7 +/- 5.7 microM) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)(h = 1.0 +/- 0.1; Km = 687 +/- 50 microM). In the presence of 1 mM CHEMICALNOTIN, used as a competitive cofactor analogue to BH4, hyperbolic saturation curves were also found for CHEMICALNOTIN (h = 1.0), thus confirming the genuine nature of the kinetic negative cooperativity. This cooperativity was confirmed by real-time biospecific interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance detection. The equilibrium binding of CHEMICALNOTIN to the immobilized iron-free apoenzyme results in a saturable positive resonance unit (DeltaRU) response with negative cooperativity (h = 0.52-0.56). Infrared spectroscopic studies revealed a reduced thermal stability both of the apo-and the holo-GENEIN on binding of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN). Moreover, the ligand-bound forms of the enzyme also showed a decreased resistance to limited tryptic proteolysis. These findings indicate that the binding of CHEMICALNOTIN at the active site induces a destabilizing conformational change in the enzyme which could be related to the observed negative cooperativity. Thus, our studies provide new insight into the regulation of GENEIN by the concentration of CHEMICALIN which may have significant implications for the physiological regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis in neuroendocrine cells.
12167567	Disposition of a specific GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, in human. CHEMICALIN is a potent and specific inhibitor of GENEIN, which is used for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, and the dysmenorrhea pain. Eight male human subjects each received a single 50-mg oral dose of CHEMICALNOTIN. Urine, feces, and blood samples were collected after administration of the radioactive dose. Most of the radioactivity in plasma was associated with CHEMICALNOTIN and the hydroxylated metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN (M1). The estimated terminal half-life for CHEMICALNOTIN was about 7 h. About 76.1% of the radioactive dose was recovered in urine and 18% of the radioactive dose was recovered in feces. CHEMICALNOTIN was extensively metabolized in human, and nine phase I metabolites were identified. The primary oxidative metabolic pathways of CHEMICALNOTIN involved hydroxylation at either the CHEMICALNOTIN group to form M1 or CHEMICALNOTIN-hydroxylation at the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety to form M2. Further oxidation of M1 led to the formation of several other phase I metabolites. Oxidative breakdown of the CHEMICALNOTIN function group in M2 led to the formation of corresponding CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN metabolites. The CHEMICALNOTIN conjugate of M1 and CHEMICALNOTIN conjugate of CHEMICALNOTIN were the major urinary metabolites, which accounted for 23.3 and 19.5% of the total administered dose, respectively. The remaining urinary metabolites were glucuronide conjugates of other phase I metabolites. Only 3% of the administered dose was recovered in urine as unchanged parent, suggesting that renal clearance is insignificant for CHEMICALNOTIN. Absorption of CHEMICALNOTIN was excellent since the recovery of unchanged CHEMICALNOTIN in feces was <1% of the administered dose.
23444429	Defective DNA damage response and repair in liver cells expressing hepatitis B virus surface antigen. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is implicated in liver cancer. The aim of this study was to find out whether HBV or its components [HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), HBV core protein (HBc), and HBV X protein (HBx)] could interfere with the host DNA damage response and repair pathway. The full HBV genome or individual HBV open-reading frame (ORF) was introduced into HepG2 cells to examine the effect on host genomic stability, DNA repair efficacy in response to double-strand DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced cell death. Responses to apoptosis induction in the HBV ORF-transfected HepG2 cells were also compared with those in HBV-positive and HBV-negative human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. In the absence of HBV replication, accumulation of HBsAg in liver cells without other HBV proteins enhanced DNA repair protein and tumor suppressor promyelocytic leukemia (PML) degradation, which resulted in resistance to apoptosis induction and deficient double-strand DNA repair. However, HBsAg-positive cells exhibited increased cell death with exposure to the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitor that blocks single-strand DNA repair. These results indicate that suppression of PML by HBsAg disrupts cellular mechanisms that respond to double-strand DNA damage for DNA repair or apoptosis induction, which may facilitate hepatocarcinogenesis and open up a synthetic lethality strategy for HBsAg-positive HCC treatment.-Chung, Y.-L. Defective DNA damage response and repair in liver cells expressing hepatitis B virus surface antigen.
7958159	Effects of labor and delivery on fibrinolysis. Because timing of sampling is crucial in an investigation of the effects of labor and delivery on fibrinolysis we conducted a study of fibrinolytic markers in plasma of 10 healthy multiparous women in whom labor was induced, which allowed standardization of sampling times in relation to the course of labor and delivery. Blood samples were taken 5 min before the start of oxytocin infusion, at full cervical dilatation, and within 5 min after delivery of the placenta. A sample of mixed free flowing cord blood was obtained after delivery with the placenta in situ. Variables determined were tissue-type plasminogen-activator (t-PA) and the plasminogen activator inhibitors type 1 (PAI-1) and type 2 (PAI-2). The only significant change between the beginning of the induction of labor and the end of the first stage of labor was a rise in t-PA antigen (P = 0.01). All variables, except PAI-2 antigen, changed significantly after delivery of the placenta: t-PA antigen and activity showed a rise (P < 0.05), accompanied by a fall in PAI-1 antigen and activity (P < 0.01). T-PA activity in cord plasma was higher (P < 0.01) in comparison with maternal plasma concentrations at the end of the first stage of labor, t-PA antigen levels were similar, and PAI-1 antigen and activity and PAI-2 antigen were lower in cord plasma (P < 0.001). Our study shows that activation of the maternal fibrinolytic system can already be detected during labor, with a marked further increase in fibrinolytic potential after placental separation.
23401139	Toxicity and toxicokinetics of binary combinations of petroleum hydrocarbon distillates with the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Petroleum hydrocarbons (PHCs) act via narcosis and are expected to have additive toxicity. However, previous work has demonstrated less-than-additive toxicity with PHC distillates and earthworms. A study was initiated to investigate this through toxicity and toxicokinetic studies with the earthworm Eisenia andrei. Three petroleum distillate fractions, F2 (>C10-C16), F3a (>C16-C23), and F3b (>C23-C34), were used in two binary combinations, F2F3a and F3aF3b. In the toxicity study, clean soil was spiked with equitoxic combinations of the two distillates ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 toxic units. In the toxicokinetic study, a binary combination consisting of one concentration of each distillate was used. On a soil concentration basis, the toxicity of the binary combinations of distillates was less than additive. Accumulation of the individual distillates, however, was generally reduced when a second distillate was present, resulting in lower body burden. This is thought to be due to the presence of a nonaqueous-phase liquid at the soil concentrations used. On a tissue concentration basis, toxicity was closer to additive. The results demonstrate that tissue concentrations are the preferred metric for toxicity for earthworms. They also demonstrate that the Canada-wide soil standards based on individual distillates are likely protective. Environ. Toxicol. Chem. 2013;32:1016-1026. Â© 2013 SETAC.
23381951	Pharmacogenetics of Allopurinol-Making an Old Drug Safer. Allopurinol is a drug that has been used for decades to lower serum urate levels in patients with gout or chronic renal failure and in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy at risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Patients may develop cutaneous hypersensitivity reactions, ranging from mild rashes to potentially fatal severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) namely drug hypersensitivity syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Recent studies have demonstrated the association between human leukocyte antigen (HLA) B*58:01 allele and allopurinol-induced SCARs, which might explain ethnic differences in their incidences. Genotyping is now required before starting abacavir and carbamazepine so as to identify individuals susceptible to SJS. However, no genetic screening is advocated before commencement of allopurinol. The lack of availability of a rapid and inexpensive screening test for the HLA-B*58:01 allele is one of the obstacles to such screening. Development of a test that is quick, accurate, and cost-effective is warranted.
22619007	CHEMICALNOTIN triggers apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest of SGC7901 cells. CHEMICALNOTIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN compound, has shown to be of chemopreventive potential against many cancers. However, its efficacy against gastric cancer has not been well elucidated. Here, we assessed the activity of CHEMICALNOTIN on apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest in human gastric cells culture system using SGC-7901 as the model. CHEMICALNOTIN treatment could inhibit the cell growth and cause a prominent G2 phase arrest and apoptosis in dose- and time-dependent manner. In mechanistic studies, CHEMICALIN decreased the protein level of GENEIN, which might be the possible molecular mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN efficacy on the growth inhibition in SGC-7901 cells. In addition, CHEMICALIN caused an increase in GENEIN and GENEIN protein level as well as mRNA levels. Interestingly, CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis in SGC-7901 cells was independent of caspases activation. These results indicated that CHEMICALNOTIN is a cell-cycle regulator and apoptosis inducer in human gastric carcinoma SGC-7901 cells and might be used as a candidate chemopreventive agent for gastric carcinoma prevention and intervention.

23246732	Influence of developmental lead exposure on expression of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN in hippocampus. Developmental exposure to lead (CHEMICALNOTIN) has adverse effects on cognitive functioning and behavior that can persist into adulthood. Exposures that occur during fetal or early life periods may produce changes in brain related to physiological re-programming from an epigenetic influence such as altered DNA methylation status. Since DNA methylation is regulated by GENEIN and GENEIN, this study assessed the extent to which developmental CHEMICALIN exposure might affect expression of these proteins in the hippocampus. Long Evans dams were fed chow with or without added CHEMICALNOTIN (0, 150, 375, 750 ppm) prior to breeding and remained on the same diet through weaning (perinatal exposure group). Other animals were exposed to the same doses of CHEMICALNOTIN but exposure started on postnatal day 1 and continued through weaning (early postnatal exposure group). All animals were euthanized on day 55 and hippocampi were removed. Western blot analyses showed significant effects of CHEMICALIN exposure on GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN expression, with effects often seen at the lowest level of exposure and modified by sex and developmental window of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. These data suggest potential epigenetic effects of developmental CHEMICALNOTIN exposure on DNA methylation mediated at least in part through dysregulation of GENENOTIN.
18633030	Synergy between pairs of competitive antagonists at adult human muscle acetylcholine receptors. BACKGROUND: Synergistic neuromuscular blocking effects have been observed clinically with certain pairs of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) competitive antagonists. The mechanism for synergy has not been elucidated. We tested the hypothesis that synergy arises from a differential selectivity of antagonists for the two ligand binding sites on adult human nAChR. METHODS: We expressed nAChR in BOSC23 cells. We applied ACh with or without antagonists to outside-out patches and measured macroscopic currents at room temperature. We determined the IC(90) for (+)-tubocurarine, metocurine, pancuronium, vecuronium, cisatracurium, rocuronium, and atracurium. For 15 combinations of two antagonists, we determined the IC(90) for one antagonist in the presence of the IC(70) of a second antagonist. We constructed isobolograms for 90% inhibition. For single antagonists, we measured inhibition of receptors containing mutations in the epsilon- and delta-subunits to determine site selectivity. RESULTS: Two pairs of antagonists, metocurine+cisatracurium and cisatracurium+ atracurium exhibited additive inhibition. Ten combinations, including (+)-tubocurarine+ pancuronium and pancuronium+vecuronium, were highly synergistic such that the combination was two to three times more effective than expected for additivity. Three combinations were 1.5-1.6 times more effective than expected for additivity. Inhibition by (+)-tubocurarine and metocurine was sensitive to mutations in the epsilon-subunit only. Vecuronium was affected by the delta-subunit mutation only. Inhibition by other antagonists was decreased by mutations in either subunit. CONCLUSIONS: Many combinations of antagonists exhibited synergistic effects on adult human nAChR. Synergy was observed with structurally similar and dissimilar antagonists. The degree of synergy did not always correlate well with site specificity assayed with mutants. In some, but not all cases, the synergy at the receptor level correlated with clinical determinations of synergy. We conclude that the synergistic actions of muscle relaxants can be partially explained by direct interactions with adult human nAChR.
22659088	The interaction between GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN preserves coupling in the presence of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are GENENOTIN that regulate neuronal activity in a number of ways. Some of the most well studied functions of GENENOTIN, such as initiation of multiple forms of GENENOTIN-dependent long-term depression, require receptor localization near the post-synaptic density (PSD). This localization is in turn dependent on the GENENOTIN family of scaffolding proteins which bind to a small motif on the distal CHEMICALIN-termini of GENEIN, localize the receptors near the PSD, strengthen coupling to post-synaptic effectors and simultaneously uncouple the GENENOTIN from extra-synaptic effectors such as GENENOTIN. Here the selectivity of this uncoupling process was examined by testing the ability of GENENOTIN to uncouple GENENOTIN from multiple GENENOTIN including GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) expressed in rat sympathetic neurons from the superior cervical ganglion (SCG). Of these, only the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN modulatory pathway was insensitive to GENENOTIN expression. Uncoupling from this channel was achieved by co-expression of an GENEIN CHEMICALIN-terminal protein designed to disrupt a previously described direct interaction between these two proteins, suggesting that this interaction allows incorporation of GENENOTIN into the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling complex, thereby preserving modulation in the presence of scaffolding GENENOTIN. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'GENENOTIN'.
17553661	Transfection of HepG2 cells with GENENOTIN provides protection against CHEMICALNOTIN-mediated oxidative injury. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a mutagenic CHEMICALIN produced during oxidative injury that is conjugated by several GENEIN (GENEIN) isoforms. The alpha class GENEIN enzyme (GENEIN) has a particularly high catalytic efficiency toward CHEMICALIN conjugation. However, GENENOTIN expression is low in most human cells and there are other CHEMICALNOTIN metabolizing enzymes that detoxify CHEMICALNOTIN. In the current study, we determined the effect of over-expression of GENENOTIN mRNA on the sensitivity of HepG2 cells to CHEMICALNOTIN injury. HepG2 cells transfected with an GENENOTIN vector construct exhibited high steady-state GENENOTIN mRNA, high GENEIN-HNE catalytic activities, but lower basal CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) concentrations relative to insert-free vector (control) cells. Exposure to CHEMICALNOTIN elicited an increase in CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations in the control and GENENOTIN cells, although the dose-response of CHEMICALNOTIN induction differed among the two cell types. Specifically, GENEIN cells had significantly higher CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations when exposed to 5-15 microM CHEMICALIN, but not at 20 microM CHEMICALIN, suggesting extensive CHEMICALNOTIN utilization at high concentrations of CHEMICALNOTIN. The GENENOTIN cells exhibited a significant growth advantage relative to control cells in the absence of CHEMICALNOTIN, and a trend towards increased growth at low dose exposures to CHEMICALNOTIN. However, the GENENOTIN cells did not exhibit a growth advantage relative to control cells at higher CHEMICALNOTIN exposures associated with increased CHEMICALNOTIN utilization. As expected, the GENEIN cells showed resistance to CHEMICALIN stimulated lipid peroxidation at all CHEMICALIN doses. In summary, our data indicates that over-expression of GENENOTIN at levels conferring high GENEIN-CHEMICALIN conjugating activity confers a partial growth advantage to HepG2 cells and protects against CHEMICALNOTIN oxidative injury. However, the loss of proliferative capacity of GENEIN cells challenged with levels of CHEMICALIN associated with severe oxidative stress indicates a role of other CHEMICALNOTIN metabolizing enzymes, and/or CHEMICALNOTIN-electrophile transporter proteins, in providing full cellular protection against CHEMICALNOTIN toxicity.
12582227	CHEMICALNOTIN: a unique molecule that reduces body weight and ameliorates metabolic abnormalities. OBJECTIVE: Preclinical evaluation of CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN agonist, as a body-weight lowering, hypolipidemic and euglycemic agent. RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: CHEMICALNOTIN was studied in different genetic, normal, and hyperlipidemic animal models. HEK 293 cells were used to conduct the reporter-based transactivation of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. To understand the biochemical mechanism of lipid-, body-weight-, and CHEMICALNOTIN-lowering effects, activities of key beta-oxidation and lipid catabolism enzymes and gluconeogenic enzymes were studied in db/db mice treated with CHEMICALNOTIN. 3T3L1 cells were used for adipogenesis study, and HepG2 cells were used to study the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on total CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis using CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN. RESULTS: CHEMICALIN showed concentration-dependent transactivation of GENEIN and GENEIN. In the 3T3L1 cell-differentiation study, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN showed 369% and 471% increases, respectively, in CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation. CHEMICALNOTIN showed body-weight lowering and euglycemic and hypolipidemic effects in various animal models. db/db mice treated with CHEMICALIN showed 5- and 3.6-fold inhibition in GENEIN and GENEIN activity and 651% and 77% increases in the beta-oxidation enzymes GENEIN and GENEIN, respectively. HepG2 cells treated with CHEMICALNOTIN showed significant reduction in lipid synthesis. DISCUSSION: CHEMICALNOTIN showed excellent euglycemic and hypolipidemic activities in different animal models. An exciting finding is its body-weight lowering effect in these models, which might be mediated by the induction of target enzymes involved in hepatic lipid catabolism through GENENOTIN activation.
7832763	Expression and selective inhibition of the GENENOTIN. The enzyme GENEIN catalyses the oxygenation of CHEMICALIN, leading to the formation of CHEMICALIN. Recently two forms of GENENOTIN have been described: a constitutive (GENENOTIN) enzyme present in most cells and tissues, and an inducible (GENENOTIN) isoenzyme observed in many cells in response to pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN) were cloned and expressed in insect cells, utilizing a baculovirus expression system. GENEIN had a specific activity of 18.8 mumol of CHEMICALNOTIN/mg with a Km of 13.8 microM for CHEMICALIN and Vmax. of 1500 nmol of O2/nmol of enzyme, whereas GENEIN had a specific activity of 12.2 mumol of CHEMICALNOTIN/mg with a Km of 8.7 microM for CHEMICALIN and a Vmax. of 1090 nmol of CHEMICALNOTIN/nmol of enzyme. CHEMICALIN inhibited both GENEIN and GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN selectively inhibited GENEIN. Both CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN exhibited time-dependent inactivation of GENEIN, as did CHEMICALIN on both enzymes. The competitive inhibitor of GENEIN, CHEMICALIN, also displayed competitive inhibition of GENEIN. These results demonstrate the ability to generate selective non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which could provide useful improvement therapeutically in the treatment of chronic inflammatory disease.
16395286	Dose-response effect of CHEMICALNOTIN on cerebral GENENOTIN after GENENOTIN hyperstimulation. Brain arteriovenous malformations (BAVMs) are a potentially life-threatening disorder. GENENOTIN activity was greatly increased in BAVM tissue specimens. CHEMICALIN was shown to decrease cerebral GENEIN activities and angiogenesis induced by GENEIN (GENEIN). In the present study, we determined the dose-response effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on cerebral GENENOTIN using our mouse model with GENENOTIN focal hyperstimulation delivered with adenoviral vector (AdGENENOTIN) in the brain. Mice were treated with CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, respectively, at 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day through drinking water for 1 week. Our results have shown that GENEIN messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was inhibited by CHEMICALIN starting at 10 mg/kg/day (P<0.02). CHEMICALIN showed more potent inhibition on GENEIN mRNA expression, starting at 1 (P<0.005) and further at more than 30 (P<0.001) mg/kg/day. At the enzymatic activity level, CHEMICALIN started to suppress GENEIN activity at 5 mg/kg/day (P<0.001), while CHEMICALIN had an effect at a lower dose, 1 mg/kg/day (P<0.02). The inhibition of cerebral GENENOTIN mRNA and activity were highly correlated with drug levels in the brain tissue. We also assessed the potential relevant signaling pathway in vitro to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the GENEIN inhibition by CHEMICALIN. In vitro, CHEMICALIN, but not CHEMICALIN, inhibits GENEIN, at least in part, via the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN)-mediated pathway. This study provided the evidence that the CHEMICALIN inhibit stimulated cerebral GENEIN at multiple levels and are effective at very low doses, offering great potential for therapeutic use.
12668769	Investigating the regulation of one-CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) biosynthesis in C(3) plants can occur via several pathways. One major route involves the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-dependent activities of the GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN) with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) as one-CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) source. An alternative CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent pathway involves the GENEIN/GENEIN activities with CHEMICALIN as CHEMICALNOTIN source. Here, we have investigated aspects of the regulation of these two folate-mediated pathways in Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. Columbia using two approaches. Firstly, transgenic plants overexpressing GENEIN (GENEIN, GENEIN) were used to continue our previous studies on the function of GENEIN in CHEMICALIN metabolism. The CHEMICALNOTIN pool size was approximately 73 nmol (g FW)(-1) in wild type (WT) Arabidopsis plants; three independent transgenic lines had similar-sized pools of CHEMICALNOTIN. Transgenic plants produced more CHEMICALNOTIN from supplied CHEMICALNOTIN than did WT plants but were not significantly different from WT plants in their synthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN. We concluded that GENENOTIN has no direct role in the regulation of the above two pathways of CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis; the breakdown of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALIN by the GENEIN reaction is the primary and preferred fate of the organic acid in Arabidopsis. The ratio between the GENEIN/GENEIN and GENEIN/GENEIN pathways of CHEMICALIN synthesis from CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, respectively, in Arabidopsis shoots was 21 : 1; in roots, 9 : 1. In shoots, therefore, the pathway from CHEMICALNOTIN plays only a small role in CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis; in the case of roots, results indicated that the 9 : 1 ratio was as a result of greater fluxes of CHEMICALNOTIN through both pathways together with a relatively higher contribution from the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN route than in shoots. We also examined the synthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN in a GENENOTIN-deficient mutant of Arabidopsis (CHEMICALNOTIN) where the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway was impaired. Compared with WT, CHEMICALNOTIN plants accumulated 5-fold more CHEMICALNOTIN than WT after supplying CHEMICALNOTIN for 24 h; the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALNOTIN was reduced by 25% in the same time period. On the other hand, the accumulation of CHEMICALIN through the GENENOTIN/GENEIN pathway in CHEMICALNOTIN plants was 2.5-fold greater than that in WT plants. Our experiments confirmed that the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathways normally operate independently in Arabidopsis plants but that when the primary GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway is impaired the alternative GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN pathway can partially compensate for deficiencies in the synthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN.
19244097	Studies of the GENENOTIN. 13. Identification of "agonist" and "antagonist" allosteric modulators of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced CHEMICALNOTIN release. Recent studies identified novel allosteric modulators of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), and CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) partially inhibited CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) binding, slowed the dissociation rate of CHEMICALIN from the GENEIN, and partially inhibited CHEMICALIN uptake. In the present study, we report that CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, at doses that do not alter release, partially inhibited CHEMICALNOTIN-induced GENENOTIN-mediated release of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)orCHEMICALNOTIN from striatal synaptosomes ("GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN release") in a dose-dependent manner. CHEMICALIN, which does not alter GENEIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN release measured with CHEMICALNOTIN, reversed the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN also partially inhibited GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN release induced by CHEMICALNOTIN or CHEMICALNOTIN, demonstrating that the observed partial inhibition is not specific for a particular GENENOTIN substrate. CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN did not attenuate CHEMICALNOTIN-induced release of CHEMICALNOTIN from serotonergic, or CHEMICALNOTIN from noradrenergic, nerve terminals. Kinetic experiments demonstrated that CHEMICALNOTIN, in contrast to CHEMICALNOTIN, slowed CHEMICALNOTIN-induced release of CHEMICALNOTIN from dopaminergic nerve terminals without altering the apparent rate constants. The two major findings of this study are 1) the identification of both "agonist" (CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN) and "antagonist" (CHEMICALNOTIN) allosteric modulators of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced GENENOTIN-mediated CHEMICALNOTIN release and 2) CHEMICALNOTIN uptake and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced GENENOTIN-mediated efflux can be separately modulated. Such agents may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of stimulant addiction, Parkinson's disease, and other psychiatric disorders.
14656380	Enhanced GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) signaling by adeno-associated viral (AAV)-mediated gene transfer. BACKGROUND: GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) play important regulatory roles in a variety of cells and organ systems and are important therapeutic targets in the treatment of airway and cardiovascular disease. Prolonged use of beta-agonists results in tolerance secondary to receptor down-regulation resulting in reduced therapeutic efficiency. The purpose of this work is to evaluate the signaling capabilities of the GENENOTIN expressed by a recombinant adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector that also included an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene (AAV-GENENOTIN/EGFP). RESULTS: By epifluorescence microscopy, approximately 40% of infected HEK 293 cells demonstrated EGFP expression. GENEIN density measured with CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) increased either 13- or 77-fold in infected cells compared to mock infected controls depending on the culture conditions used. The CHEMICALIN binding was to a single receptor population with a dissociation constant of 0.42 nM, as would be expected for wild-type GENEIN. Agonist competition assays with CHEMICALIN showed the following rank order of potency: CHEMICALIN>CHEMICALIN> CHEMICALIN, consistent with GENEIN interaction. CHEMICALNOTIN-stimulated CHEMICALNOTIN levels were 5-fold higher in infected cells compared to controls (314 +/- 43 vs. 63.4 +/- 9.6 nmol/dish; n = 3). Receptor trafficking demonstrated surface expression of GENEIN with vehicle treatment and internalization following CHEMICALIN treatment. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that HEK 293 cells infected with AAV-GENENOTIN/EGFP effectively express GENENOTIN and that increased expression of these receptors results in enhanced GENENOTIN signaling. This method of gene transfer may provide an important means to enhance function in in vivo systems.
14587496	Update on CHEMICALNOTIN. BACKGROUND: CHEMICALIN is a CHEMICALIN drug designed to inhibit both GENEIN and GENEIN by reversibly covalently bonding to these enzymes. GENENOTIN in-creases as Alzheimer disease progresses, so its inhibition may become more important as the disease worsens. Metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN occurs at the synapse rather than at the liver and previous studies have demonstrated no drug-drug interactions. CHEMICALNOTIN has a half-life at the synapse of 9 hours allowing for bid dosing. REVIEW SUMMARY: Effective therapy requires up-titration from initial dosage of 3 mg/d to 6 mg/d with additional increases to 9 mg or 12 mg/d giving additional benefits in some patients. Beneficial effects with CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in the functioning of activities of daily living, behavior, cognition, and global functioning have been demonstrated in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer disease in 4 large double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter clinical trials. Potential adverse effects of nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea in these original Alzheimer trials with rapid (every week) dosage increases occurred in up to 34% of patients and can be minimized by slower monthly up-titrations. CHEMICALNOTIN also was proven effective in decreasing psychiatric symptoms and cognitive deficits in a large double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in patients with diffuse Lewy body disease. Other studies have suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN improves symptoms in nursing home patients with more severe stage Alzheimer disease, Parkinson dementia, and subcortical dementia. Follow-up studies have suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN may delay disease progression and, in patients discontinuing the drug, no withdrawal effects were seen. CONCLUSION: CHEMICALNOTIN is an effective therapeutic agent for treating cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Alzheimer disease and diffuse Lewy body disease and may also have beneficial effects in vascular and Parkinson dementias.
23409763	The therapeutic potential of allosteric ligands for free CHEMICALIN sensitive GENEIN. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) are the most historically successful therapeutic targets. Despite this success there are many important aspects of GENENOTIN pharmacology and function that have yet to be exploited to their full therapeutic potential. One in particular that has been gaining attention in recent times is that of GENENOTIN ligands that bind to allosteric sites on the receptor distinct from the orthosteric site of the endogenous ligand. As therapeutics, allosteric ligands possess many theoretical advantages over their orthosteric counterparts, including more complex modes of action, improved safety, more physiologically appropriate responses, better target selectivity, and reduced likelihood of desensitisation and tachyphylaxis. Despite these advantages, the development of allosteric ligands is often difficult from a medicinal chemistry standpoint due to the more complex challenge of identifying allosteric leads and their often flat or confusing SAR. The present review will consider the advantages and challenges associated with allosteric GENENOTIN ligands, and examine how the particular properties of these ligands may be exploited to uncover the therapeutic potential for free CHEMICALIN sensitive GENEIN.
23262028	Chemokine expression is upregulated in chondrocytes in diabetic fracture healing. Chemokines are thought to play an important role in several aspects of bone metabolism including the recruitment of leukocytes and the formation of osteoclasts. We investigated the impact of diabetes on chemokine expression in normal and diabetic fracture healing. Fracture of the femur was performed in streptozotocin-induced diabetic and matched normoglycemic control mice. Microarray analysis was carried out and chemokine mRNA levels in vivo were assessed. CCL4 were examined in fracture calluses by immunohistochemistry and the role of TNF in diabetes-enhanced expression was investigated by treatment of animals with the TNF-specific inhibitor, pegsunercept. In vitro studies were conducted with ATDC5 chondrocytes. Diabetes significantly upregulated mRNA levels of several chemokines in vivo including CCL4, CCL8, CCL6, CCL11, CCL20, CCL24, CXCL2, CXCL5 and chemokine receptors CCR5 and CXCR4. Chondrocytes were identified as a significant source of CCL4 and its expression in diabetic fractures was dependent on TNF (P<0.05). TNF-Î± significantly increased mRNA levels of several chemokines in vitro which were knocked down with FOXO1 siRNA (P<0.05). CCL4 expression at the mRNA and proteins levels was induced by FOXO1 over-expression and reduced by FOXO1 knockdown. The current studies point to the importance of TNF-Î± as a mechanism for diabetes enhanced chemokine expression by chondrocytes, which may contribute to the accelerated loss of cartilage observed in diabetic fracture healing. Moreover, in vitro results point to FOXO1 as a potentially important transcription factor in mediating this effect.
22288603	Allelopathic activity studies of Mikania scandens. Preliminary investigation of a number of plant extracts for allelopathic activity using seed germination inhibition bioassay showed a promising activity of the water extract of the aerial parts of Mikania scandens. Activity-guided fractionation of the M. scandens extract led to the isolation of the highly allelopathic active compound mikanolide, with minimum inhibitory concentration of 0.083âÂµMâmL(-1). As M. scandens is a highly abundant invasive plant in Sri Lanka and other South Asian countries, this plant could be developed as an environment friendly natural herbicide, either in crude form as shredded plant material or as pure mikanolide, which is the major constituent (â¼0.02%) in the plant.
11166732	Glioma cell sensitivity to CHEMICALNOTIN: the role of GENENOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN-induced DNA damage. CHEMICALIN is a GENEIN inhibitor which is currently evaluated as an adjuvant agent for malignant glioma. Here, we analysed the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on 12 human malignant glioma cell lines in vitro. All cell lines expressed GENENOTIN mRNA. High GENEIN protein levels, but not genetic or functional GENEIN status, were associated with increased CHEMICALIN-induced DNA/GENEIN complex formation. Neither functional GENENOTIN status, nor GENENOTIN protein levels, nor complex formation predicted CHEMICALNOTIN-induced growth inhibition. We thus confirm a possible role for GENEIN protein in modulating GENEIN activity but conclude that the major molecular determinants of CHEMICALIN sensitivity in glioma cells await identification.
11562773	Binding site of CHEMICALIN to GENEIN depends on species. A novel drug candidate is checked on its potency on animal models before it can advance to human phase of the research. Usually negative results on animal phase disqualify it. Targeting specific enzymes by small chemicals raises the question about the appropriateness of this approach. As an example, the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is recognized as an important enzyme responsible for cancer metastasis and angiogenesis. It is therefore important to ask the question if a small chemical will inhibit GENENOTIN of different species with the same or different potency. Using DNA sequence and known structure of GENENOTIN we have modeled 3D structures of GENENOTIN for several different species. By theoretical calculations we have determined most probable structure of CHEMICALIN/GENEIN complexes. Catalytic triad (B57, B102, B195) and specificity pocket (B187-B197, B212-B229) are highly conserved in all cases, and are the regions responsible for proteolytic activity and recognition of the substrate. Significant differences were observed in a different region (loop B93-B101), that we identified as binding site of CHEMICALIN to the GENEIN (GENEIN). Although GENENOTIN shares the same function of activating plasminogen and it is structurally similar to GENENOTIN. CHEMICALIN is a specific inhibitor of GENEIN but does not inhibit GENEIN. Our study shows that predicted position of CHEMICALNOTIN depends on species and in some cases was located, as expected, in the specificity pocket, but in the other cases close to the loop B93-B101. This location could weaken affinity of binding or prevent inhibition of GENENOTIN. Therefore, drug screening and elimination process based solely on animal study, without careful structural analysis, could lead to the elimination of potential drugs for humans.
10522750	Threshold concentrations of GENENOTIN: the effects on contractions induced by CHEMICALNOTIN in isolated rat cerebral and mesenteric arteries. This study compares the effects of threshold concentrations of GENENOTIN in isolated rat basilar arteries with those in mesenteric arterial branches and investigates the mechanisms of inhibitory and potentiating GENENOTIN-effects. In basilar arteries, GENENOTIN reduces the contractions induced by CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), by the CHEMICALNOTIN agonist CHEMICALNOTIN, and by CHEMICALNOTIN. The inhibitory effect of GENEIN on the contraction induced by CHEMICALNOTIN is abolished by deendothelialization, by the GENEIN antagonist CHEMICALIN, by CHEMICALIN, or by CHEMICALIN. In mesenteric arteries, GENENOTIN potentiates the contractile effects of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN. The potentiation of the contractile effect induced by CHEMICALNOTIN is only somewhat modified by deendothelialization, but abolished by the GENEIN antagonists CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN potentiates the CHEMICALNOTIN-effect in mesenteric arteries. Thus, though the contractile GENENOTIN were not blocked, threshold concentrations of GENENOTIN inhibited contractile effects in the rat basilar artery via activation of GENENOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN are involved in this inhibitory action. In contrast, GENENOTIN potentiates contractile actions in mesenteric arteries via the release of endogeneous CHEMICALNOTIN from non-endothelial cells. The study points out the completely different role of the endothelium in combined effects of GENENOTIN between cerebral and mesenteric arteries.
17135600	ABCA1 single nucleotide polymorphisms on high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol and overweight: the D.E.S.I.R. study. The adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) gene plays a key role in reverse cholesterol transport. Some ABCA1 gene polymorphisms have been associated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of three polymorphisms, C69T, G378C, and G1051A (R219K), on HDL-C levels and their interaction with BMI in more than 5000 French whites from the D.E.S.I.R. (Data from an Epidemiological Study on the Insulin Resistance syndrome) cohort study. The T allele of the C69T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) was associated with higher HDL-C levels in normal-weight men (BMI <25 kg/m(2)). The C allele of the G378C SNP was associated with lower HDL-C in overweight subjects (BMI > or =25 kg/m(2)). For the G1051A SNP, in the normal-weight group, the minor A allele was significantly associated with higher HDL-C levels. In contrast, in overweight people, the minor allele was associated with lower HDL-C levels. After accounting for multiple testing, empiric p values remained significant for the associations between G378C SNP and HDL-C in the overweight group and between G1051A SNP and HDL-C in the normal-weight group. This study suggests that ABCA1 gene polymorphisms modulate HDL-C concentrations, in interaction with BMI, and, thus, they might influence cardiovascular risk in the general population.
23419783	CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN in Relation to Cancer Risk in Type II Diabetes Patients: A Meta-analysis using primary data of published studies. INTRODUCTION: Accumulating evidence suggests that patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hyperinsulinemia are at increased risk for developing malignancies. It remains to be fully elucidated whether use of CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN sensitizer, and/or CHEMICALIN, GENEIN secretagogues, affect cancer incidence in subjects with T2DM. MATERIAL & METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis using PubMed, of randomized control trials (RCTs), cohorts, and case-control studies published through July 2012 that assess effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and/or CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN on cancer risk at any site, in subjects with T2DM. Fixed and random effects meta-analysis models were used, and the effect size was summarized as relative risk (RR) for RCTs/cohorts and as odds ratio (OR) for the case-control studies. RESULTS: Analysis of 24 CHEMICALNOTIN studies in subjects with T2DM showed that CHEMICALNOTIN use is associated with reduced risk for the development of cancer, in both cohort (RR=0.70 [95% CI=0.67-0.73]) and case-control studies (OR=0.90 [95% CI=0.84-0.98]), but this finding was not supported by RCTs (RR=1.01[95% CI=0.81-1.26]). Data from 18 CHEMICALNOTIN studies in subjects with T2DM showed that CHEMICALNOTIN use is associated with an increase in all-cancer risk, in cohort studies (RR=1.55 [95% CI=1.48 -1.63]), though data from RCTs (RR=1.17 [95% CI=0.95-1.45]) and case-control studies (OR=1.02 [95% CI=0.93-1.13]) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant effect. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis using pooled primary data demonstrates that CHEMICALNOTIN use reduces, while CHEMICALNOTIN use may be associated with an increased cancer risk in subjects with T2DM. These findings need to be confirmed in large-scale RCTs before they are translated into clinical practice.
23375228	Discovery and structure-activity relationships of small molecules that block the GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN) protein-protein interaction. The GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, prolongs the half-life of GENENOTIN in the serum and represents a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune disease. Small molecules that block the protein-protein interactions of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN may lower pathogenic autoantibodies and provide effective treatment. A novel class of CHEMICALIN has been discovered as antagonists of the GENEIN:GENEIN protein-protein interaction through optimization of a hit derived from a virtual ligand-based screen.
23265474	Comparative formation of 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in creatinine/phenylalanine and creatinine/phenylalanine/4-oxo-2-nonenal reaction mixtures. The comparative formation of the heterocyclic aromatic amine 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) in both creatinine/phenylalanine (CRN/Phe) and creatinine/phenylalanine/4-oxo-2-nonenal (CRN/Phe/ON) systems was studied to analyse the ability of lipid-derived reactive carbonyls to promote PhIP formation. Although PhIP was produced to some extent in the CRN/Phe system, the presence of the oxidized lipid increased considerably the amount of PhIP produced. This increase seemed to be a consequence of the decrease in the E(a) of the reaction when the lipid was present, which diminished from 112.9 to 80.9 kJ/mol. On the other hand, the addition of the lipid did not seem to produce PhIP by an alternative mechanism because PhIP was formed analogously in both CRN/Phe and CRN/Phe/ON systems as a function of pH, creatinine concentration, phenylalanine concentration, time, temperature, oxygen concentration in the reaction atmosphere, and the addition of different amounts of ammonia. All these results suggest that the ability of lipid oxidation products to produce PhIP is related to their capacity to induce the Strecker degradation of phenylalanine to phenylacetaldehyde. Therefore, any other reactive carbonyl compound that can produce the Strecker degradation of phenylalanine should also be considered as a potential inducer of PhIP formation under appropriate conditions.
7906055	CHEMICALNOTIN: an endogenous CHEMICALNOTIN-displacing substance in the brain. CHEMICALIN, an antihypertensive drug, binds to GENEIN. The endogenous ligand for GENEIN may be a CHEMICALIN-displacing substance, a small molecule isolated from bovine brain. This CHEMICALNOTIN-displacing substance was purified and determined by mass spectroscopy to be CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), heretofore not detected in brain. CHEMICALIN binds to GENEIN and stimulates release of CHEMICALNOTIN from adrenal chromaffin cells. Its biosynthetic enzyme, GENENOTIN, is present in brain. CHEMICALIN, locally synthesized, is an endogenous agonist at GENEIN, a CHEMICALNOTIN ligand at GENEIN and may act as a neurotransmitter.
23537574	Amino acids as co-amorphous stabilizers for poorly water soluble drugs - Part 1: Preparation, stability and dissolution enhancement. Poor aqueous solubility of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) is one of the most pressing problems in pharmaceutical research and development because up to 90% of new API candidates under development are poorly water soluble. These drugs usually have a low and variable oral bioavailability, and therefore an unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. One of the most promising approaches to increase dissolution rate and solubility of these drugs is the conversion of a crystalline form of the drug into its respective amorphous form, usually by incorporation into hydrophilic polymers, forming glass solutions. However, this strategy only led to a small number of marketed products usually because of inadequate physical stability of the drug (crystallization). In this study, we investigated a fundamentally different approach to stabilize the amorphous form of drugs, namely the use of amino acids as small molecular weight excipients that form specific molecular interactions with the drug resulting in co-amorphous forms. The two poorly water soluble drugs carbamazepine and indomethacin were combined with amino acids from the binding sites of the biological receptors of these drugs. Mixtures of drug and the amino acids arginine, phenylalanine, tryptophan and tyrosine were prepared by vibrational ball milling. Solid-state characterization with X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) revealed that the various blends could be prepared as homogeneous, single phase co-amorphous formulations indicated by the appearance of an amorphous halo in the XRPD diffractograms and a single glass transition temperature (Tg) in the DSC measurements. In addition, the Tgs of the co-amorphous mixtures were significantly increased over those of the individual drugs. The drugs remained chemically stable during the milling process and the co-amorphous formulations were generally physically stable over at least 6months at 40Â°C under dry conditions. The dissolution rate of all co-amorphous drug-amino acid mixtures was significantly increased over that of the respective crystalline and amorphous pure drugs. Amino acids thus appear as promising excipients to solve challenges connected with the stability and dissolution of amorphous drugs.
23439661	Disposition and Metabolism of CHEMICALNOTIN in Humans: A Novel CHEMICALNOTIN-Containing Antibiotic. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) is a novel CHEMICALNOTIN-containing antibiotic that inhibits GENEIN, and that has been in development for the treatment of serious Gram-negative infections. In this study, six healthy adult male subjects received a single i.v. dose of CHEMICALNOTIN, 1500 mg infused over 1 hour. Blood, urine, and feces were collected over an extended period of 14 days, and accelerator mass spectrometry was used to quantify low levels of radioactivity in plasma at later time points to supplement the less-sensitive liquid scintillation counting technique. An excellent mass balance recovery was achieved representing a mean total of 98.2% of the dose, including 90.5% recovered in the urine. Pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated that radioactivity was moderately associated with the blood cellular components, and together with CHEMICALNOTIN, both were highly distributed into tissues. The parent compound had a much shorter half-life than total radioactivity in plasma, approximately 11.6 hours compared with 96 hours. CHEMICALNOTIN and its major metabolite M3, which resulted from oxidation of the CHEMICALNOTIN side chain to the corresponding CHEMICALNOTIN, comprised the majority of the plasma radioactivity, 37 and 53% of the area under the plasma versus time concentration curve from time zero to infinity, respectively. Additionally, M3 was eliminated renally, and was demonstrated to be responsible for the long plasma radioactivity elimination half-life. A combination of in vitro metabolism experiments and a pharmacokinetic study in monkeys with the inhibitor CHEMICALIN provided strong evidence that GENEIN, potentially in association with GENENOTIN, is the primary enzyme involved in the formation of the M3 metabolite.
17325243	Identification of a novel polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the L-arginine transporter gene SLC7A1: contribution to hypertension and endothelial dysfunction. BACKGROUND: Endothelial dysfunction because of reduced nitric oxide bioavailability is a key feature of essential hypertension. We have found that normotensive siblings of subjects with essential hypertension have impaired endothelial function accompanied by altered arginine metabolism. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have identified a novel C/T polymorphism in the 3'UTR of the principal arginine transporter, solute carrier family 7 (cationic amino acid transporter, y+ system), member 1 gene (SLC7A1). The minor T allele significantly attenuates reporter gene expression (P<0.01) and is impaired in its capacity to form DNA-protein complexes (P<0.05). In 278 hypertensive subjects the frequency of the T allele was 13.3% compared with 7.6% in 498 normotensive subjects (P<0.001). Moreover, the overall genotype distribution observed in hypertensives differed significantly from that in normotensives (P<0.001). To complement these studies, we generated an endothelial-specific transgenic mouse overexpressing L-arginine transporter SLC7A1. The Slc7A1 transgenic mice exhibited significantly enhanced responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine (-log EC50 for wild-type versus Slc7A1 transgenic: 6.87+/-0.10 versus 7.56+/-0.13; P<0.001). This was accompanied by elevated production of nitric oxide by isolated aortic endothelial cells. CONCLUSIONS: The present study identifies a key, functionally active polymorphism in the 3'UTR of SLC7A1. As such, this polymorphism may account for the apparent link between altered endothelial function, L-arginine, and nitric oxide metabolism and predisposition to essential hypertension.
23632081	Identification of an Allosteric Modulator of GENENOTIN with Novel Mechanism of Action. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) play an essential role in the termination and regulation of CHEMICALNOTIN signaling in the brain. GENENOTIN is also the target of antidepressants and psychostimulants. Molecules with novel activities and modes of interaction with regard to GENENOTIN function are of great scientific and clinical interest. We explored structural regions outside the putative CHEMICALNOTIN translocation pathway to identify potential binding sites for allosteric transporter modulators (ATMs). Mutational studies revealed a pocket of CHEMICALNOTIN outside the orthosteric substrate binding sites located in the interface between extracellular loops 1 and 3 that when mutated affect transporter function. Using the structure of the bacterial transporter homologue GENENOTIN as a template, we developed a structural model of GENENOTIN. We performed molecular dynamics simulations to further characterize the allosteric pocket that was identified by site-directed mutagenesis studies and employed this pocket in a virtual screen for small-molecule modulators of GENENOTIN function. In functional transport assays, we found that one of the identified molecules, ATM7, increased the reuptake of CHEMICALIN, possibly by facilitating the interaction of CHEMICALIN with transport-ready conformations of GENEIN when concentrations of CHEMICALIN were low and rate limiting. In addition, ATM7 potentiates CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN, "Ecstasy")-induced reversed transport by GENEIN. Taking advantage of a conformationally sensitive residue in transmembrane domain 6, we demonstrate that ATM7 mechanistically stabilizes an outward-facing conformation of GENENOTIN. Taken together these observations demonstrate that ATM7 acts through a novel mechanism that involves allosteric modulation of GENENOTIN function.
22349823	Structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities of non-small cell lung cancer-associated mutants of GENENOTIN. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) has an essential role in multiple signaling pathways, including cell proliferation and migration, through extracellular ligand binding and subsequent activation of its intracellular GENENOTIN. The non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-associated GENENOTIN mutants, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, are constitutively active and oncogenic. They display sensitivity to GENEIN inhibitors, including CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN. In contrast, the secondary mutation of the gatekeeper residue, GENENOTIN, reportedly confers inhibitor resistance on the oncogenic GENENOTIN mutants. In this study, our biochemical analyses revealed that the introduction of the GENENOTIN mutation confers CHEMICALIN resistance on the GENEIN mutant. The GENEIN/GENEIN double mutant has enhanced activity and retains high CHEMICALIN-binding affinity. The GENENOTIN mutation increases the CHEMICALIN affinity of the GENEIN mutant, explaining the acquired drug resistance of the double mutant. Structural analyses of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN double mutant, as well as the wild type and the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN mutants, revealed that the GENENOTIN mutation stabilizes the hydrophobic spine of the active GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN conformation. The CHEMICALIN790 side chain of the GENEIN/GENEIN double mutant, in the apo form and CHEMICALNOTIN- and AMPPNP-bound forms, adopts different conformations that explain the accommodation of these ligands. In the GENEIN mutant structure, the active-site cleft is expanded by the repositioning of CHEMICALIN723 within the P-loop. Notably, the introduction of the GENEIN mutation greatly enhanced the CHEMICALIN sensitivity of the wild-type GENEIN in vivo, supporting our hypothesis that the expansion of the active-site cleft results in enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN sensitivity. Taken together, our results provide a structural basis for the altered drug sensitivities caused by distinct NSCLC-associated GENENOTIN mutations.
23335025	Chemopreventive effects of Ginkgo biloba extract in estrogen-negative human breast cancer cells. Excessive level of estrogen is considered as a main cause of breast cancer, therefore, many studies have focused on estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer, even though ER-negative cancer has a poor prognosis than ER-positive breast cancer. We evaluated the anti-cancer effects of Ginkgo biloba extract (GBE) in estrogen-independent breast cancer. GBE has been traditionally used as a platelet activating factor, a circulatory stimulant, a tonic, and anti-asthmatic drug, and anti-cancer agent.Â However, anti-cancer effects of GBE on ER-negative breast cancer have not been proved yet. In this study, we tested chemotherapeutic potential of GBE in the MDA-MB-231 (ER-negative) human breast cancer cell line.Â Our results showed that cytotoxicity effects of GBE in MDA-MB-231 lead to DNA fragmentation at high concentrations (500 and 1,000Â Î¼g/ml). Caspase-3 was significantly activated and mRNA levels of apoptosis-related genes (Bcl-2 and Bax) were altered. These results indicate that GBE induces apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. It is presumed that GBE has chemopreventive effects in ER-independent breast cancer through anti-proliferation and apoptosis-inducing activities.
12196163	Biosynthesis of CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN clusters is a complex and highly conserved process. CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN ([CHEMICALNOTIN]) clusters are simple inorganic prosthetic groups that are contained in a variety of proteins having functions related to electron transfer, gene regulation, environmental sensing and substrate activation. In spite of their simple structures, biological [CHEMICALNOTIN] clusters are not formed spontaneously. Rather, a consortium of highly conserved proteins is required for both the formation of [CHEMICALNOTIN] clusters and their insertion into various protein partners. Among the [CHEMICALNOTIN] cluster biosynthetic proteins are included a CHEMICALIN-dependent enzyme (GENEIN) that is involved in the activation of CHEMICALNOTIN from CHEMICALIN, and a molecular scaffold protein (GENENOTIN) upon which [CHEMICALNOTIN] cluster precursors are formed. The formation or transfer of [CHEMICALNOTIN] clusters appears to require an electron-transfer step. Another complexity is that molecular chaperones homologous to DnaJ and DnaK are involved in some aspect of the maturation of [CHEMICALNOTIN]-cluster-containing proteins. It appears that the basic biochemical features of [CHEMICALNOTIN] cluster formation are strongly conserved in Nature, since organisms from all three life Kingdoms contain the same consortium of homologous proteins required for [CHEMICALNOTIN] cluster formation that were discovered in the eubacteria.
23641914	Copolymerization of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and glycidyl methacrylate, a well-defined and efficient process for achieving functionalized polyesters for covalent binding of bioactive molecules. The understanding of cell-material interactions is important for creating personalized implants for tissue engineering. This has resulted in an interest in developing polymers with functional groups with the possibility of controlling the macromolecular surface. We have in a one-pot reaction synthesized a series of amorphous and degradable polyester-based copolymers with active functional groups by copolymerization of 2-methylene-1,3-dioxepane and glycidyl methacrylate. The properties of the final polymers were varied by varying the feed ratios of the monomers and it was seen that it was possible to control the amount of active functional groups. The resulting epoxy-functionalized polyester was further modified by covalent immobilization of heparin. The heparinization was done in order, in a future aspect, to enhance the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells. Heparin binds directly with the growth factor bone morphogenetic protein-2 and helps to retain its activity. The molecular structure of the copolymers was characterized by nuclear magnetic resonance, size exclusion chromatography, and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. Differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing showed that the monomer feed ratio had a great influence on the properties of the final polymer and that it thus was possible to control the mechanical properties to suit an intended application. The presence of heparin was verified by toluidine blue staining and all the films tested showed positive signals for heparin.
23219161	GENENOTIN and cellular defense against DNA damage. In mammalian cells, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is an unusual specialized GENENOTIN whose in vivo function is under active investigation. GENENOTIN has been implicated by different experiments to play a role in resistance to ionizing radiation and defense against genomic instability, in base excision repair, and in immunological diversification. The protein is formed by an GENEIN, a GENEIN, and a GENENOTIN that spans between the two. This arrangement is also found in the GENENOTIN protein, which functions in resistance to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents. Homologs of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN are found in multicellular eukaryotes, including plants, but a comparison of phenotypes suggests that not all of these genes are functional orthologs. Flies defective in GENENOTIN are sensitive to DNA interstrand crosslinking agents, while mammalian cells defective in GENENOTIN are primarily sensitive to DNA double-strand breaking agents. Cells from GENENOTIN(-/-) mice are hypersensitive to radiation and peripheral blood cells display increased spontaneous and ionizing radiation-induced levels of micronuclei (a hallmark of gross chromosomal aberrations), though mice apparently develop normally. Loss of GENENOTIN in human and mouse cells causes sensitivity to ionizing radiation and other double strand breaking agents and increased DNA damage signaling. Retrospective studies of clinical samples show that higher levels of GENENOTIN gene expression in breast and colorectal cancer are correlated with poorer outcomes for patients. A clear understanding of the mechanism of action and physiologic function of GENENOTIN in the cell is likely to bear clinical relevance.
23558747	Impaired in vivo binding of GENENOTIN to chromatin in the absence of its GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN is a GENENOTIN that is a main component of brain chromatin in vertebrates. In vitro studies have determined that in addition to its specific GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) GENENOTIN also has several GENENOTIN. However, the specific interactions of GENENOTIN with methylated or non-methylated chromatin regions and the structural characteristics of the resulting DNA associations in vivo remain poorly understood. We analysed the role of the GENENOTIN in GENEIN-chromatin associations in vivo using an GENEIN mutant Rett syndrome mouse model (GENEIN(tm)(1)(.)(1)(Jae)) in which exon 3 deletion results in an CHEMICALIN-terminal truncation of the protein, including most of the GENENOTIN. Our results show that in mutant mice, the truncated form of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) is expressed in different regions of the brain and liver, albeit at 50% of its wild-type (wt) counterpart. In contrast to the punctate nuclear distribution characteristic of wt GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN exhibits both diffuse nuclear localization and a substantial retention in the cytoplasm, suggesting a dysfunction of nuclear transport. In mutant brain tissue, neuronal nuclei are smaller, and GENENOTIN chromatin is digested faster by GENENOTIN, producing a characteristic nuclease-resistant dinucleosome. Although a fraction of GENENOTIN is found associated with nucleosomes, its interaction with chromatin is transient and weak. Thus, our results unequivocally demonstrate that in vivo the GENENOTIN of GENENOTIN together with its adjacent region in the N-terminal domain are critical for the proper interaction of the protein with chromatin, which cannot be replaced by any other of its protein domains.
15547682	Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 and the genes encoding GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN. Pseudohypoaldosteronism type 1 (PHA1), a rare disorder of infancy, presents with potential life-threatening salt wasting and failure to thrive. Thus far, PHA1 has been attributed to mutations affecting the GENENOTIN or any of the three subunits assembling the GENEIN (GENEIN). However, a lot of patients with a phenotype resembling PHA1, show no defects in these proteins, making it likely that further genes are involved in the aetiology of this disease. Recent studies have elucidated additional participants (GENENOTIN and members of the families of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN, respectively) regulating and/or interacting in the complex pathway of CHEMICALNOTIN retention in the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive distal nephron. This led us to investigate whether PHA1 can also be associated with mutations in some of these genes. Our data suggest that at least the GENENOTIN gene might be excluded as a causative locus.
23291240	Cerebral and extracerebral cholesterol metabolism and CSF markers of Alzheimer's disease. The disturbances of the cholesterol synthesis and metabolism described in Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be both a consequence of the neurodegenerative process and a contributor to the pathogenesis. These putative relationships and their underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between the cerebral and extracerebral cholesterol synthesis and metabolism, and the AD pathology as reflected by CSF markers in humans. We evaluated the relationships between the plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cholesterol, the cholesterol precursors lanosterol, lathosterol and desmosterol, and the cholesterol elimination products 24S-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol, and the CSF markers for AD pathology AÎ²1-42 and p-tau181 in 86 subjects with normal cognition and in 107 AD patients. CSF desmosterol, cholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the AD group, and CSF 24S-hydroxycholesterol in the control group correlated with the p-tau181 levels. Neither CSF nor plasma concentrations of the included compounds correlated with the CSF AÎ²1-42 levels. In multivariate regression tests including age, gender, albumin ratio, number of the APOEÉ4 alleles, and diagnosis, p-tau181 levels independently predicted the CSF desmosterol, cholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol concentrations. The associations remained significant for CSF cholesterol and 24S-hydroxycholesterol when analyses were separately performed in the AD group. The results suggest that alterations of CNS cholesterol de novo genesis and metabolism are related to neurodegeneration and in particular to the cerebral accumulation of phosphorylated tau.
23074021	In vivo genotoxicity of CHEMICALIN in GENEIN delta transgenic rats following medium-term exposure. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), which is commonly used as a fragrance and flavoring agent, has been shown to induce hepatocellular tumors in rodents. However, the role of genotoxicity as a possible mechanism of action is not fully understood even though the DNA-reactive metabolite of CHEMICALNOTIN has been identified. In this study, a GENENOTIN delta transgenic rat model was used to clarify whether genotoxic mechanisms are involved in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis following medium-term exposure. F344 GENEIN delta rats were subjected to repeated oral administration of CHEMICALIN at dosages of 0, 10, 30, or 100mg/kg (a carcinogenic dose) for 13 weeks. The relative weight of the liver of the male and female rats that were administered 100mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN and the absolute weight of the liver of the male rats that were administered 100mg/kg CHEMICALNOTIN were significantly increased. In addition, the number and area of GENEIN (GENEIN) positive foci and GENEIN (GENEIN) positive cell ratios in the hepatocytes were significantly increased in the male and female rats that were administered 100mg/kg CHEMICALIN compared with the control animals. In the in vivo mutation assays, a significant increase in the GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN(-) mutant frequencies was observed in both sexes at the carcinogenic dose. These results suggest the possible participation of genotoxic mechanisms in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatocarcinogenesis.
23451797	Structural Investigation and Biological Activity of Sesquiterpene Lactones from the Traditional Chinese Herb Inula racemosa. Five new sesquiterpene lactones, racemosalactones A-E (1-5), along with 19 known sesquiterpene latones (6-24), were isolated from the roots of Inula racemosa. Their structures were elucidated by extensive spectroscopic analysis, and the absolute configuration of 2 was deduced from X-ray diffraction analysis. Compounds 1, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 17 exhibited antiproliferative activities with IC50 values ranging from 0.38 to 4.19 Î¼g/mL against human non-small-cell lung cancer A549, hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2, and human fibrosarcoma HT1080 cells. Compounds 6 and 8 exhibited antiproliferative activities against endothelial cells with IC50 values of 2.4 and 2.5 Î¼g/mL, respectively. Furthermore, compounds 6 and 8 both inhibited endothelial cell tube formation at 1.0 Î¼g/mL. A method for the rapid and straightforward preparative-scale isolation of compound 6 from alantolides is described.
23416143	CHEMICALNOTIN fraction from citrus peels attenuates alcoholic liver disease in mice. This study aimed to demonstrate protective activities of the CHEMICALNOTIN fraction from peels of Citrus unshiu against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatic damage through an animal study. Citrus CHEMICALNOTIN fraction (CNF), contained 75% of CHEMICALNOTIN, was obtained by an ultra-sonicated extraction and further purification. ICR mice were divided into four groups; normaldiet control, CHEMICALNOTIN control (6.5g CHEMICALNOTIN/kg), low-CNF (CHEMICALNOTIN+150mg CNF/kg) and high-CNF (CHEMICALNOTIN+300mg CNF/kg) groups. Consumption of CHEMICALIN for 8weeks induced severe liver damage with increases in prognostic indicators such as GENEIN, GENEIN in serum whereas co-administration of CNF suppressed their increases. Excessive accumulations in liver TG and TC in CHEMICALNOTIN control group were also suppressed by co-administration of CNF. Co-administration of CNF maintained GENENOTIN activity, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN levels close to those of the normal diet group. Chronic consumption of CHEMICALIN also stimulated abrupt increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines such as GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN in liver otherwise co-administration of CNF effectively suppressed production of these GENENOTIN dose-dependently. These results indicate that co-administration of CNF with CHEMICALNOTIN can alleviate CHEMICALNOTIN induced liver damage through preventing lipid formation, protecting antioxidant system and suppressing productions of pro-inflammatory GENENOTIN.
23349501	Impaired local production of pro-resolving lipid mediators in obesity and CHEMICALNOTIN as a potential treatment for obesity-associated inflammation. Obesity-induced chronic low-grade inflammation originates from adipose tissue and is crucial for obesity-driven metabolic deterioration including GENENOTIN resistance and type 2 diabetes.Chronic inflammation may be a consequence of a failure to actively resolve inflammation,and could result from a lack of local specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) such as CHEMICALNOTIN and protectins, which derive from the n-3 CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN). We assessed obesity-induced changes of n-3-derived SPM in adipose tissue and effects of dietary CHEMICALNOTIN/CHEMICALNOTIN thereon.Moreover, we treated obese mice with SPM precursors and investigated effects on inflammation and metabolic dysregulation. Obesity significantly decreased CHEMICALNOTIN-derived CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN precursor) and CHEMICALNOTIN levels in murine adipose tissue. Dietary CHEMICALIN/CHEMICALIN treatment restored endogenous biosynthesis of n-3 derived lipid mediators in obesity while attenuating adipose tissue inflammation and improving GENEIN sensitivity. Notably, CHEMICALIN treatment reduced adipose tissue expression of inflammatory GENEIN, increased GENEIN expression and improved CHEMICALNOTIN tolerance parallel to GENEIN sensitivity in obese mice. These findings indicate that impaired biosynthesis of certain SPM and SPM precursors including CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN contributes to adipose tissue inflammation in obesity and suggest CHEMICALNOTIN as a novel treatment option for obesity-associated complications.
23164673	The GENEIN/GENEIN pathway is involved in CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis in cultured osteosarcoma cells. CHEMICALNOTIN, a major component of cinobufacini (huachansu), is an important CHEMICALNOTIN. Several studies have suggested that CHEMICALNOTIN has potent anti-cancer effects. The present study examines the apoptosis-inducing activity and the underlying mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN in osteosarcoma (OS) cells. Our results showed that CHEMICALNOTIN potently inhibited the proliferation of U2OS, MG63 and SaOS-2 cells. Significant increases in G2/M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis in OS cells were also observed. The expression levels of several apoptotic proteins were assessed after CHEMICALNOTIN treatment in U2OS cells. Among them, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels decreased remarkably, while the levels of GENENOTIN and cleaved-GENENOTIN increased. Furthermore, we validated the inhibition of GENEIN/GENEIN signaling following CHEMICALIN treatment. Western blots showed a decrease in nuclear GENEIN protein expression after exposure to different concentrations of CHEMICALIN, while the phosphorylation of GENEIN was simultaneously increased. Transduction with constitutively active forms of GENENOTIN could protect against the downregulation of GENEIN and upregulation of cleaved-GENEIN that are induced by CHEMICALIN treatment. However, combined treatment with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN resulted in a significant reduction in GENEIN and an increase in cleaved-GENEIN in U2OS cells. Altogether, these results show that CHEMICALNOTIN is a promising agent for the treatment of OS. These studies are the first to reveal the involvement of the GENEIN/GENEIN pathway in CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis.
23152186	CHEMICALIN activates GENEIN GENENOTIN signaling to inhibit stem cell differentiation in adipogenesis. Dysfunctional lipid and CHEMICALNOTIN metabolism contribute to metabolic syndrome-a major public health concern that enhances cardiovascular disease risk. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) exposure may increase metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease risk by impairing adipose tissue differentiation, function, and insulin sensitivity through pathogenic mechanisms that remain unclear. We hypothesized that CHEMICALNOTIN signals through the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) sensitive, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) to impair adipogenesis, as previously demonstrated for its stimulation of vascular oxidant generation, angiogenesis, and remodeling. Because both CHEMICALNOTIN and GENENOTIN ligands inhibit progenitor cell differentiation into adipocytes, we investigated the hypothesis in a model of low-passage human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSC). CHEMICALNOTIN (0.1-1.0 ÂµM) suppressed CHEMICALNOTIN/insulin-induced hMSC adipogenesis, as indicated by decreased transcriptional promoters of differentiation, decreased fat droplet formation, and decreased expression of differentiated adipocyte markers, such as GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. Preincubating hMSC with GENENOTIN prevented 90% of the suppressive effect of CHEMICALNOTIN. Selective competitive antagonists of GENENOTIN-coupled GENENOTIN were ~60% effective in blocking CHEMICALNOTIN inhibition and combination of antagonists to both receptors were 85% effective. In contrast, antagonists to the GENENOTIN (previously shown to mediate CHEMICALNOTIN vascular effects) or the GENENOTIN were ineffective in blocking CHEMICALNOTIN effects. These studies suggest a majority of CHEMICALNOTIN-inhibited adipocyte differentiation, and metabolism requires GENENOTIN GENENOTIN and that CHEMICALIN effects on GENEIN signaling are tissue and context specific. This may represent a significant mechanism for the contribution of CHEMICALNOTIN exposure to increased metabolic and cardiovascular diseases.
9079657	Activation-dependent exposure of the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN mediates ligand binding to GENENOTIN. Binding of GENENOTIN to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) is contributed by GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). The structural requirements of this recognition were investigated. GENENOTIN or catalytically inactive CHEMICALIN-GENEIN bound indistinguishably to HUVEC and GENENOTIN transfectants, and inhibited equally well the binding of 125I-GENENOTIN to these cells. Similarly, GENENOTIN active site inhibitors TAP or NAP5 did not reduce ligand binding to GENENOTIN. A GENEIN peptide duplicating the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN inhibited GENENOTIN-independent GENENOTIN activation by HUVEC and blocked binding of CHEMICALNOTIN-GENENOTIN to these cells in a dose-dependent manner (IC50 approximately 20-40 microM). In contrast, none of the other GENENOTIN peptides tested or a control peptide with the GENENOTIN in scrambled order was effective. A recombinant chimeric molecule expressing the GENENOTIN sequence GENENOTIN within a GENENOTIN backbone inhibited binding of CHEMICALNOTIN-GENENOTIN to HUVEC and GENENOTIN transfectants in a dose-dependent fashion, while recombinant GENENOTIN or plasma GENENOTIN had no effect. An antibody generated against the GENENOTIN peptide 83-88, and designated JC15, inhibited 125I-GENENOTIN binding to HUVEC. The JC15 antibody bound to GENENOTIN and the recombinant IX/X83-88 chimera in a concentration dependent manner, while no specific reactivity with GENENOTIN was observed. Furthermore, binding of CHEMICALNOTIN-GENENOTIN to immobilized JC15 was inhibited by molar excess of unlabeled GENENOTIN, but not by comparable concentrations of GENENOTIN. These findings identify the GENENOTIN GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN as a novel recognition site for GENENOTIN, and suggest its potential role as a protease activation-dependent neo-epitope. This interacting motif may help elucidate the contribution of GENENOTIN to cellular assembly of coagulation and vascular injury.
23479389	CHEMICALIN: a novel GENEIN antagonist for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. Considering the prevalence of cardiovascular disease in public health and the limited validated therapeutic options, this study aimed to find novel compounds targeting the GENENOTIN, accepted as a therapeutic target in cardiovascular disease. A small library consisting of 89 compounds from 39 Chinese herbs was profiled using a cell-based calcium mobilization assay which was developed and characterized for high-throughput screening. CHEMICALIN derived from Zingiber officinale Roscoe (ginger) was identified as a novel GENEIN antagonist, with an IC50 value of 8.173 ÂµM. The hit was further tested by a specificity assay indicating that it had no antagonistic effects on other evaluated GENENOTIN, such as GENENOTIN. The major ingredient of ginger, CHEMICALIN, could inhibit GENEIN activation, which partially clarified the mechanism of ginger regulating blood pressure and strengthening heart in the cardiovascular system.
23541928	Osteochondral tissue regeneration using a bilayered composite hydrogel with modulating dual growth factor release kinetics in a rabbit model. Biodegradable oligo(poly(ethylene glycol) fumarate) (OPF) composite hydrogels have been investigated for the delivery of growth factors (GFs) with the aid of gelatin microparticles (GMPs) and stem cell populations for osteochondral tissue regeneration. In this study, a bilayered OPF composite hydrogel that mimics the distinctive hierarchical structure of native osteochondral tissue was utilized to investigate the effect of transforming growth factor-Î²3 (TGF-Î²3) with varying release kinetics and/or insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) on osteochondral tissue regeneration in a rabbit full-thickness osteochondral defect model. The four groups investigated included (i) a blank control (no GFs), (ii) GMP-loaded IGF-1 alone, (iii) GMP-loaded IGF-1 and gel-loaded TGF-Î²3, and (iv) GMP-loaded IGF-1 and GMP-loaded TGF-Î²3 in OPF composite hydrogels. The results of an in vitro release study demonstrated that TGF-Î²3 release kinetics could be modulated by the GF incorporation method. At 12weeks post-implantation, the quality of tissue repair in both chondral and subchondral layers was analyzed based on quantitative histological scoring. All groups incorporating GFs resulted in a significant improvement in cartilage morphology compared to the control. Single delivery of IGF-1 showed higher scores in subchondral bone morphology as well as chondrocyte and glycosaminoglycan amount in adjacent cartilage tissue when compared to a dual delivery of IGF-1 and TGF-Î²3, independent of the TGF-Î²3 release kinetics. The results suggest that although the dual delivery of TGF-Î²3 and IGF-1 may not synergistically enhance the quality of engineered tissue, the delivery of IGF-1 alone from bilayered composite hydrogels positively affects osteochondral tissue repair and holds promise for osteochondral tissue engineering applications.
23494186	GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN Goals in High-Risk Patients: How Low Do We Go and How Do We Get There? It is widely recognised that GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (GENENOTIN-C) is one of the most important and modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD). Statins (GENENOTIN inhibitors) have consistently been shown to decrease both GENENOTIN-C and CVD risk in almost all patient categories, with the exception of heart and kidney failure as well as advanced aortic stenosis. As a consequence, statins have become the cornerstone in current prevention guidelines. In patients who do not reach the GENENOTIN-C target, combination therapy with additional GENEIN-C lowering drugs (e.g. CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN sequestrants or CHEMICALIN) should be considered. Guidelines provide different GENENOTIN-C levels to strive for, depending on the CVD risk. In this review, we describe the rationale for these GENENOTIN-C targets and how these goals might be reached by current and future therapies.
10839989	Contrasting effects of CHEMICALIN derivatives on GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN [CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN] is one of several cofactors of GENEIN (GENEIN). Here we compared the action of CHEMICALIN-substituted derivatives on recombinant GENEIN with their effects on GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN (GENEIN),the well-studied classical CHEMICALNOTIN-dependent reactions. CHEMICALNOTIN substituted at CHEMICALNOTIN with CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN groups were used. Substitution at CHEMICALNOTIN occurs at a position critical to the redox cycle of the cofactor in GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN. We also included CHEMICALNOTIN, a derivative substituted at a position not directly involved in redox cycling, as a control. As compared with CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN bound with twice the capacity but stimulated GENEIN to a lesser extent. Depending on the substituent used, CHEMICALNOTIN-substituted derivatives were redox-active: CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN, but not CHEMICALNOTIN- and CHEMICALNOTIN, reduced CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN derivatives were not oxidized to products serving as substrates for GENEIN and,depending on the substituent, were competitive inhibitors of GENENOTIN: CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN inhibited GENEIN, whereas CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN had no effect. Our data demonstrate differences in the mechanism of stimulation of GENEIN and GENEIN by CHEMICALIN. They are compatible with a novel, non-classical, redox-active contribution of CHEMICALIN to the catalysis of the GENEIN reaction.
21712771	GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mRNA and immunoreactive proteins in mouse brain. OBJECTIVE: GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) mRNA and protein were examined (1) to determine whether adult mouse brain expresses full-length GENENOTIN mRNA that can be translated to functional transporter protein and (2) to compare immunoreactive GENENOTIN proteins in brain and adrenal. METHODS: GENENOTIN mRNA was detected in mouse brain with RT-PCR. The cDNA was sequenced, cloned into an expression vector, transfected into COS-1 cells, and cell protein was assayed for GENENOTIN activity. Immunoreactive proteins were examined on western blots probed with four different antibodies to GENENOTIN. RESULTS: Sequencing confirmed identity of the entire coding sequences of GENENOTIN cDNA from mouse medulla oblongata/pons and adrenal to a Gen-Bank reference sequence. Transfection of the brain cDNA into COS-1 cells resulted in transporter activity that was blocked by the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN and a proton ionophore, but not by CHEMICALIN, which has a high affinity for GENEIN. Antibodies to either the CHEMICALIN- or CHEMICALIN- terminus of GENEIN detected two proteins (73 and 55 kD) in transfected COS-1 cells. The CHEMICALIN-terminal antibodies detected both proteins in extracts of mouse medulla/pons, cortex, hypothalamus, and cerebellum but only the 73 kD protein and higher molecular weight immunoreactive proteins in mouse adrenal and rat PC12 cells, which are positive controls for GENEIN. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that a functional GENENOTIN mRNA coding sequence is expressed in mouse brain and suggest processing of GENENOTIN protein differs in mouse adrenal and brain.
10561751	GENENOTIN in renal disease. Recent studies of hereditary renal tubular disorders have facilitated the identification and roles of GENENOTIN in the regulation of the most abundant anion, CHEMICALNOTIN, in the ECF. Thus, mutations that result in a loss of function of the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, are associated with Dent's disease, which is characterized by low-molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrolithiasis, and renal failure. Mutations of another GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, are associated with a form of Bartter's syndrome, whereas other forms of Bartter's syndrome are caused by mutations in the GENEIN (GENENOTIN) and the GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN. Finally, mutations of the GENEIN (GENENOTIN) are associated with Gitelman's syndrome. These studies have helped to elucidate some of the renal tubular mechanisms regulating mineral homeostasis and the role of GENENOTIN.
16801455	GENEIN modulates CHEMICALIN synthesis through nonfreely exchangeable CHEMICALIN pools in human endothelial cells. Reduced synthesis of CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) contributes to the endothelial dysfunction and may be related to limited availability of CHEMICALIN, the common substrate of GENEIN (GENEIN) and cytosolic GENEIN and GENEIN. To determine whether GENEIN modulate the endothelial CHEMICALIN synthesis, we investigated the effects of the competitive GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) on the activity of GENEIN, GENEIN, and GENEIN and on CHEMICALNOTIN release at surface of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In unstimulated cells, CHEMICALIN dose-dependently reduced the GENEIN activity with maximal inhibition at 20 microM. When HUVECs were stimulated by GENENOTIN without extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALIN dose-dependently increased the GENEIN activity and the CHEMICALNOTIN release with maximal effects at 20 microM. Extracellular CHEMICALIN also dose-dependently increased CHEMICALNOTIN release and GENEIN activity. When HUVECs were stimulated by GENENOTIN in the presence of 100 microM CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN activity and CHEMICALNOTIN release were similar in untreated and CHEMICALIN-treated cells. However, despite activation of CHEMICALNOTIN uptake, the inhibition of GENEIN activity by CHEMICALIN was still significant. The depletion of freely exchangeable CHEMICALNOTIN pools with extracellular CHEMICALNOTIN did not prevent CHEMICALNOTIN from increasing the CHEMICALNOTIN release. This indicates the presence of pools, which are accessible to GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, but not exchangeable. Interestingly, the GENENOTIN was constitutively expressed, whereas the cytosolic GENENOTIN was barely detectable in HUVECs. These data suggest that endothelial CHEMICALIN synthesis depends on the activity of GENEIN in mitochondria and CHEMICALNOTIN carriers in cell membrane.
16686685	The role of late I and antiarrhythmic drugs in EAD formation and termination in Purkinje fibers. Multiple components of cardiac CHEMICALNOTIN current play a role in determining electrical excitation in the heart. Recently, the role of nonequilibrium components in controlling cardiac action potential plateau duration, and their importance in regulating the occurrence of afterdepolarizations and arrhythmias have garnered more attention. In particular, late CHEMICALNOTIN current (late I(CHEMICALNOTIN)) has been shown to be important in LQT2 and LQT3 arrhythmias. Class III agents like CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN, which can all cause a drug-induced form of LQT2, significantly lengthen action potential duration at 50% and 90% repolarization in isolated rabbit Purkinje fibers, and can initiate the formation of early afterdepolarizations, and extra beats. These actions can lead to the development of a serious ventricular tachycardia, torsades de pointes, in animal models and patients. However, pretreatment with agents that block late I(CHEMICALNOTIN), like CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALIN, a novel mixed GENEIN blocker for the rapid pharmacologic conversion of atrial fibrillation, significantly attenuates the prolonging effects of Class III agents or those induced by ATX-II, a specific toxin that delays GENENOTIN inactivation and amplifies late I(CHEMICALNOTIN) greatly, mimicking LQT3. The GENEIN block caused by CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN can be through the open or inactivated states of the channel, but both equivalently inhibit a late component of CHEMICALNOTIN current (I(CHEMICALNOTIN)), recorded at 22 degrees C using whole-cell patch clamp of GENENOTIN expressed in HEK cells. These protective actions of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and CHEMICALNOTIN may result, at least in part, from their ability to inhibit late I(CHEMICALNOTIN) during action potential repolarization, and inhibition of the inward currents contributing to EAD and arrhythmia formation.
10712236	CHEMICALNOTIN depletion delays apoptosis of rat intestinal epithelial cells. The CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, and their precursor CHEMICALNOTIN are essential for cell growth and the regulation of the cell cycle. Recent studies suggest that excessive accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN favors either malignant transformation or apoptosis, depending on the cell type and the stimulus. This study examines the involvement of CHEMICALNOTIN in the induction of apoptosis by the GENENOTIN inhibitor, camptothecin. In IEC-6 cells, CHEMICALNOTIN induced apoptosis within 6 h, accompanied by detachment of cells. Detached cells showed DNA laddering and GENENOTIN induction, characteristic features of apoptosis. Depletion of CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN, and CHEMICALIN by CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN), a specific inhibitor of GENEIN (GENEIN) that is the first rate-limiting enzyme for CHEMICALNOTIN biosynthesis, decreased the apoptotic index. Delayed apoptosis was accompanied by a decrease in GENENOTIN activity in CHEMICALNOTIN-depleted cells. Addition of CHEMICALIN restored the induction of apoptosis as indicated by an increase in the number of detached cells and GENEIN activity. CHEMICALNOTIN depletion did not change the level of GENENOTIN protein. Inhibition of GENEIN by a specific inhibitor [CHEMICALIN; CHEMICALIN] led to depletion of CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN with a significant accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN and induction of GENENOTIN. The CHEMICALNOTIN-treated cells showed an increase in apoptosis, suggesting the importance of CHEMICALNOTIN in the apoptotic process. Addition of CHEMICALIN to CHEMICALNOTIN-treated cell extracts did not increase GENEIN activity. The above results indicate that CHEMICALNOTIN depletion delays the onset of apoptosis in IEC-6 cells and confers protection against DNA damaging agents, suggesting that CHEMICALIN might be involved in the GENEIN activating signal cascade.
23620660	Profile of certolizumab and its potential in the treatment of psoriatic arthritis. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a chronic inflammatory arthropathy associated with psoriasis (PsO). PsA could be considered an enthesal disease because of the link between mechanical stress (entheses) and immunologically active tissue (synovium). Evidence of efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) is supported by reduction of histological vascularity and immune cell infiltrates in synovial tissue after treatment. Certolizumab pegol (CZP) is a polyethylene glycolylated (PEGylated) Fab' fragment of a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes human TNF-alpha. The PEG moiety of the Fab fragment, markedly increases the half-life of CZP and confers to the drug a unique structure that differs from the other anti-TNF-alpha agents tested for the treatment of Crohn's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, axial spondyloarthritis, nonradiographic spondyloarthritis, PsO, and PsA. In contrast to other anti-TNF-alpha agents, CZP did not mediate increased levels of apoptosis, suggesting that these mechanisms are not essential for the anti-TNF-alpha efficacy in Crohn's disease. As CZP, infliximab, and adalimumab, but not etanercept, almost completely inhibited lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-1 beta release from monocytes, this cytokine-production inhibition may be relevant for drug efficacy. Due to these characteristics, it has been demonstrated in clinical studies that CZP effectively improves signs and symptoms of arthritis and physical function and skin manifestations of PsO, with a safety profile similar to rheumatoid arthritis. This drug can be considered as a valid treatment in patients affected by PsA. The efficacy and tolerability profiles suggest CZP as a suitable antipsoriatic drug in the treatment of PsA.
23313633	Predictive modeling of insulin release profile from cross-linked chitosan microspheres. Insulin-loaded microspheres composed of chitosan 3% (w/v), and loading 120 IU insulin were produced by emulsion cross-linking method. Cross-linking time was 5 h and glutaraldehyde 3.5% (v/v) was used as cross-linker. Swelling ratio studies were evaluated to predict release of insulin from chitosan microspheres. Bacitracin and sodium taurocholate were incorporated in the formulations as proteolytic enzyme inhibitor and absorption enhancer, respectively. In vitro insulin release studies were performed in phosphate buffer pH 7.4 and also in HCl pH 2 with and without trypsin. Activity of bacitracin was also evaluated. In vitro release showed a controlled profile up to 12 h and the formulation containing 0.15% (w/v) of bacitracin revealed a maximum biological activity of about 49.1 Â± 4.1%. Mathematical modeling using Higuchi and Korsmeyer-Peppas suggested a non-Fickian diffusion as the mechanism of insulin release. Insulin-loaded chitosan microspheres for oral delivery showed to be an innovative and reliable delivery system to overcome conventional insulin therapy.
14692707	Serum CHEMICALIN concentration and its relation to change in plasma GENEIN level in the treatment of heart failure: a preliminary study. OBJECTIVE: To examine the influence of CHEMICALIN dose and concentration in serum on plasma GENEIN (GENEIN), a measure of heart failure progression. METHODS: 12 patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class II-III chronic heart failure were enrolled in the study. They received CHEMICALNOTIN at daily doses of 1-20 mg with a 1-2 weekly adjustment. Serum CHEMICALNOTIN trough concentrations were measured in steady-state using a specific fluorescence HPLC method. The degree of improvement in heart failure was assessed from the ratio of change in the plasma GENEIN concentration, 2 weeks, 1 month and 3 months after the commencement of CHEMICALIN administration. RESULTS: From the pharmacokinetic aspect, there was no valid correlation between the trough serum CHEMICALNOTIN concentration (Cmin) and daily dose per body weight (Dd/BW), indicating that there was a wide difference in the CHEMICALNOTIN elimination capacity among individuals. A significant decrease in the GENENOTIN was observed at the 3rd month in patients treated with the high dose (> 750 mg/3 months). On the other hand, in patients with a mean serum CHEMICALIN level (Cmin) of less than 2.5 nmol/l up to 2 weeks after the start ofCHEMICALIN therapy, the degree of reduction in the GENEIN value after the 3rd month was significantly larger, relative to the patient group with Cmin over 2.5 nmol/l. CONCLUSIONS: The total CHEMICALNOTIN dose was confirmed to be one of the determinants for improvement in heart failure, and it was suggested that the initial serum level also plays an important role in therapeutic outcome. Therefore, it may be important to monitor the serum CHEMICALNOTIN level at the introductory period to determine the daily dose requirements because of the wide inter-individual variability in its metabolic clearance.
9666414	Mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN in rheumatoid arthritis. CHEMICALNOTIN, a novel drug with proven efficacy in rheumatoid arthritis, is an CHEMICALNOTIN derivative structurally unrelated to other immunomodulatory drugs. CHEMICALNOTIN is rapidly metabolized to its active form, CHEMICALNOTIN. Two mechanisms of action have been identified for CHEMICALIN: inhibition of GENEIN (GENEIN) and inhibition of GENEIN. GENEIN inhibition occurs at lower concentrations of CHEMICALIN than that of GENEIN and is currently considered the major mode of action. Stimulated lymphocytes must increase ribonucleotide levels from 8 to 16-fold before proceeding from the G1 into the S phase. Increased levels of ribonucleotides can only be met by de novo ribonucleotide synthesis. At low levels of ribonucleotides, GENENOTIN, a "sensor" molecule, gets activated and prevents progression through the cell cycle. Therefore, an inhibitor of de novo CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis would predictably arrest stimulated cells at the G1 phase. In support of this mechanism of action, in vitro mitogen stimulated human peripheral blood lymphocytes treated with CHEMICALNOTIN undergo arrest at the G1 phase; this inhibition is reversed by CHEMICALNOTIN.
12513997	CHEMICALIN accumulation and freeze tolerance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae are caused by a mutation in the GENENOTIN gene encoding GENEIN. We previously isolated a mutant which showed a high tolerance to freezing that correlated with higher levels of intracellular CHEMICALNOTIN derived from CHEMICALNOTIN analogue-resistant mutants. The mutation responsible for the analogue resistance and CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation was a single nuclear dominant mutation. By introducing the mutant-derived genomic library into a non-CHEMICALNOTIN-utilizing strain, the mutant was found to carry an allele of the wild-type GENENOTIN gene encoding GENEIN, which resulted in a single CHEMICALIN replacement; CHEMICALIN (GENENOTIN) at position 154 was replaced by CHEMICALIN (GENENOTIN). Interestingly, the allele of GENENOTIN was shown to enhance the activities of GENEIN and GENEIN, both of which catalyze the first two steps of CHEMICALIN synthesis from CHEMICALIN and which together may form a complex in vivo. When cultured in liquid minimal medium, yeast cells expressing the mutated GENEIN were found to accumulate intracellular CHEMICALIN and showed a prominent increase in cell viability after freezing at -20 degrees C compared to the viability of cells harboring the wild-type GENENOTIN gene. These results suggest that the altered GENEIN results in stabilization of the complex or has an indirect effect on GENEIN activity, which leads to an increase in CHEMICALIN production in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The approach described in this paper could be a practical method for breeding novel freeze-tolerant yeast strains.
23145773	Structural optimization of CHEMICALIN as highly potent and selective GENEIN inhibitors for the treatment of osteoporosis. Inhibition of GENENOTIN is an attractive mechanism for the treatment of osteoporosis. We report here the optimization of GENEIN inhibitors in the CHEMICALIN class by varying the size of the linker (n equals 0 and 2) between the CHEMICALNOTIN moiety and the CHEMICALNOTIN group. While none of the CHEMICALIN (n = 2) were active, most of the CHEMICALIN (n = 0) turned out to moderately or strongly inhibit GENEIN. The four most active compounds showed an ICââ of around 60 nM and a very good selectivity toward GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and the GENENOTIN. The investigated compounds inhibited monkey GENENOTIN moderately, and one of them showed good inhibitory activity on GENENOTIN. SAR studies allowed a first characterization of the GENENOTIN active site, which is predicted to be considerably larger than that of GENENOTIN.
16651698	Changes in submaxillary gland gene expression in F344 rats by multiple dosing of CHEMICALNOTIN. Multiple exposure to CHEMICALIN, a GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor, induces acinar hypertrophy in the salivary gland. This study examined the effect of CHEMICALIN on the gene expression of secretory proteins and GENEIN in the submaxillary gland. Male F344 rats received saline or CHEMICALNOTIN (50 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days. The gene expressions for the secretory protein, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), and GENENOTIN in the submaxillary gland were quantified using RT-PCR. CHEMICALIN exposure resulted in a sustained increase in mRNA expression for GENEIN and GENEIN, but GENEIN gene expression was unchanged. Our results suggest that submaxillary hypertrophy is primarily caused by the enhanced transcription of GENENOTIN, and that the transcription of each GENENOTIN subfamily gene is regulated differently.
22484424	eIF4F suppression in breast cancer affects maintenance and progression. Levels of eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) are frequently elevated in human cancers and in some instances have been associated with poor prognosis and outcome. Here we utilize transgenic and allograft breast cancer models to demonstrate that increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling can be a significant contributor to breast cancer progression in vivo. Suppressing mTOR activity, as well as levels and activity of the downstream translation regulators, eIF4E and eIF4A, delayed breast cancer progression, onset of associated pulmonary metastasis in vivo and breast cancer cell invasion and migration in vitro. Translation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), matrix metallopeptidase 9 (MMP9) and cyclin D1 mRNAs, which encode products associated with the metastatic phenotype, is inhibited upon eIF4E suppression. Our results indicate that the mTOR/eIF4F axis is an important contributor to tumor maintenance and progression programs in breast cancer. Targeting this pathway may be of therapeutic benefit.
10434156	[Psychopharmacological profile of venlafaxine]. Venlafaxine is an antidepressant which blocks reuptake of noradrenaline and serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. These data have been confirmed by behavioral tests. It has been shown that by decreasing the overall cerebral quantity of 5-HT and NA, venlafaxine continued to have an antidepressant action in animal models. In addition, the drug has been shown to act preferentially on 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors.
23358194	Transcriptome alterations following developmental CHEMICALNOTIN exposure in zebrafish are associated with disruption of neuroendocrine and reproductive system function, cell cycle, and carcinogenesis. CHEMICALNOTIN, a herbicide commonly applied to agricultural areas and a common contaminant of potable water supplies, is implicated as an endocrine-disrupting chemical (EDC) and potential carcinogen. Studies show that EDCs can cause irreversible changes in tissue formation, decreased reproductive potential, obesity, and cancer. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency considers an CHEMICALNOTIN concentration of â¤ 3 ppb in drinking water safe for consumption. The specific adverse human health effects associated with a developmental CHEMICALNOTIN exposure and the underlying genetic mechanisms of these effects are not well defined. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a range of CHEMICALNOTIN concentrations to establish toxicity. Morphological, transcriptomic, and protein alterations were then assessed at 72h postfertilization following developmental CHEMICALNOTIN exposure at 0, 0.3, 3, or 30 ppb. A significant increase in head length was observed in all three CHEMICALNOTIN treatments. Transcriptomic profiles revealed 21, 62, and 64 genes with altered expression in the 0.3, 3, and 30 ppb CHEMICALNOTIN treatments, respectively. Altered genes were associated with neuroendocrine and reproductive system development, function, and disease; cell cycle control; and carcinogenesis. There was a significant overlap (42 genes) between the 3 and 30 ppb differentially expressed gene lists, with two of these genes (GENEIN and GENEIN) present in all three CHEMICALIN treatments. Increased transcript levels were translated to significant upregulation in protein expression. Overall, this study identifies genetic and molecular targets altered in response to a developmental CHEMICALNOTIN exposure to further define the biological pathways and mechanisms of toxicity.
20012638	Effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN on isolated rat's tracheal smooth muscle. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and its prodrug CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) are highly potent GENEIN agonists often used in asthma patients. CHEMICALNOTIN in the form of inhaled short-acting bronchodilator relieves asthmatic symptoms. However, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN given intratracheally have rarely been explored. To verify the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN, which act on the tracheal smooth muscle directly in vitro, we used our preparation to test the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on isolated rat's tracheal smooth muscle compared with CHEMICALNOTIN. The following assessments of CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN were performed: (1) effect on tracheal smooth muscle resting tension; (2) effect on contraction caused by 10(-6) M CHEMICALNOTIN as a parasympathetic mimetic; (3) effect of the drugs on electrically induced tracheal smooth muscle contractions. The results indicated that adding CHEMICALNOTIN induced a significant further contraction to 10(-6) M CHEMICALNOTIN-induced contraction when the preparation was increased to 10(-4) M. But CHEMICALNOTIN elicited a relaxation response at a dose of 10(-6) M or more. Both CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN could inhibit electrical field stimulation (EFS) induced spike contraction. CHEMICALNOTIN had an anti-cholinergic effect that could relieve asthmatic symptoms. But the effect of bambuterol acting on tracheal smooth muscle directly was controversial.
8894610	CHEMICALIN, an GENEIN antagonist, inhibits the positive inotropic effect but not the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN in rabbit heart. The influence of CHEMICALIN, a selective GENEIN antagonist, on the positive inotropic effect and the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN that are induced via GENENOTIN was studied in comparison with that of another GENEIN ligand CHEMICALIN in the rabbit ventricular myocardium. CHEMICALIN elicited a concentration-dependent positive inotropic effect via GENEIN in the presence of either CHEMICALIN or CHEMICALIN. The mode of antagonism induced by CHEMICALNOTIN on the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN was dependent or the concentration applied: CHEMICALNOTIN at 1 and 3 nM acted in a competitive manner, the slope of the regression line of the Schild plot being unity and the pA2 value being 9.12; at 10 nM, it shifted further the concentration-response curve to the right without affecting the maximal response but the slope became less than unity. At 100 nM and higher, it suppressed the maximal response to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN effectively antagonized the positive inotropic effect of CHEMICALIN even after inactivation of GENEIN by treatment with CHEMICALIN, which is an indication that the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive subtype belongs to a class resistant to CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALIN, over the range of concentrations at which it antagonized the positive inotropic effect mediated by GENEIN, did not affect the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN that was induced by 10 microM CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN antagonized the positive inotropic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in a competitive manner without affecting the accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN induced by CHEMICALNOTIN. These results indicate that the positive inotropic effect, mediated via CHEMICALIN- and CHEMICALIN-sensitive subtype of GENEIN, is exerted by a subcellular mechanism that is independent of the accumulation of CHEMICALIN.
23313376	CHEMICALIN exerts antitumor activity against human osteosarcoma cells by inhibiting the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway. Osteosarcoma is a high-grade malignant bone tumor. CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) is a natural, dimethylated analog of CHEMICALNOTIN with higher bioavailability. While CHEMICALNOTIN has been shown to have potent antitumor activity against various types of cancer, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN remain largely unknown. The GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN) signaling pathway plays a crucial role in tumorigenesis and immune development. In this study, we assessed the antitumor activity of CHEMICALIN against human osteosarcoma cells and explored the role of GENEIN/GENEIN and apoptosis-related signaling pathways on the activity of CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN treatment resulted in a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of osteosarcoma cell viability. Additionally, CHEMICALNOTIN exhibited strong antitumor activity, as evidenced not only by reductions in tumor cell adhesion, migration and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) but also by increases in the apoptotic index, reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species (ROS) and several biochemical parameters. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN treatment directly inhibited the phosphorylation of GENEIN at CHEMICALIN 1007 and the downstream activation of GENEIN. CHEMICALIN also down-regulated the expression of GENEIN target genes, including the anti-apoptotic proteins GENEIN and GENEIN, leading to the up-regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway-related proteins (GENEIN, GENEIN, cytosolic GENEIN, and cleaved GENEIN) and GENENOTIN inhibitors such as GENEIN and GENEIN. CHEMICALIN, used in combination with a known GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor, CHEMICALIN, further decreased the viability of osteosarcoma cells. Taken together, CHEMICALIN is a potent inhibitor of osteosarcoma cell growth that targets the GENEIN/GENEIN signaling pathway. These data suggest that inhibition of GENEIN/GENEIN signaling is a novel mechanism of action for CHEMICALIN during therapeutic intervention in osteosarcoma cancers.
23435910	Effect of CHEMICALNOTIN against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats. CHEMICALNOTIN is a member of the CHEMICALNOTIN family and is abundant in cereals, nuts, oil seeds, and berries. It exhibits a wide range of pharmacological properties. In this study, we investigated the hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN)-induced chronic liver injury in rats. CHEMICALNOTIN remarkably prevented CHEMICALNOTIN-induced loss of body weight. This was accompanied by a significant increase in levels of serum GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and liver CHEMICALNOTIN content. Furthermore, CHEMICALIN reduced hepatic CHEMICALNOTIN content, which correlated with a reduction in the expression of GENEIN mRNA and histological analysis of GENEIN in liver tissue. Additionally, the expression of hepatic fibrosis-related factors such as GENEIN and GENEIN (GENEIN), were reduced in rats treated with CHEMICALIN. CHEMICALNOTIN exhibited strong scavenging activity. In conclusion, we find that CHEMICALIN exhibits hepatoprotective and antifibrotic effects against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced liver injury, most likely due to its antioxidant activities of scavenging radicals, its capacity to suppress GENEIN and its ability to attenuate activation of hepatic stellate cells. This suggests that CHEMICALNOTIN is a potentially useful agent for the protection against liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
17624589	Glutathione S-transferase M1 and P1 polymorphisms and risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions in Chinese women. Enzymes encoded by the glutathione S-tranferase mu 1 (GSTM1) and pi 1 (GSTP1) genes, which are expressed in breast tissue, catalyze the detoxification of endogenous and exogenous electrophiles. Reduced enzyme activity, due to carriage of the GSTM1 deletion or the GSTP1 Ile105Val Val allele, may therefore affect susceptibility to breast cancer and related conditions. In a case-control study of Chinese women, we examined whether these polymorphisms were associated with risk of breast cancer and fibrocystic breast conditions. Women diagnosed with breast cancer (n=615) or fibrocystic breast conditions (n=467) were compared to women without clinical breast disease (n=878). We also examined whether these associations differed by menopausal status or by presence of proliferation in the extra-tumoral epithelium among women with breast cancer and in lesions among women with fibrocystic conditions. No overall association of either GST polymorphism with risk of breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions was observed. There was some evidence of slightly elevated cancer risk associated with carriage of the GSTM1 null genotype and at least one GSTP1 105-Val allele (OR=1.33, 95% CI, 0.99-1.80), compared to carriage of the GSTM1 non-null and GSTP1 Ile/Ile genotypes. This relationship was stronger in women who had breast cancer with extra-tumoral tissue proliferation (OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.03-3.04). Our results suggest that GSTM1 and GSTP1 genotypes do not individually influence susceptibility to breast cancer or fibrocystic breast conditions. The observed increased risk of breast cancer associated with joint carriage of the GSTM1 null genotype and GSTP1 105-Val allele needs confirmation in other studies.
17588300	CHEMICALNOTIN--a review of effects on cardiovascular complications in hypertension and chronic heart failure. UNLABELLED: Therapeutic interventions that block the GENENOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN-CHEMICALNOTIN system (RAAS) have an important role in slowing the progression of cardiovascular risk actors to established cardiovascular diseases. In recent years, GENENOTIN blockers (ARBs) have emerged as effective and well-tolerated alternatives to an GENENOTIN inhibitor (ACEi) for RAAS blockade. The ARB CHEMICALNOTIN was initially established as an effective once-daily antihypertensive treatment, providing 24-h blood pressure (BP) control with a trough:peak ratio close to 100%. SCOPE: A Medline literature search was undertaken to identify randomised, controlled trials that examined the efficacy and cardiovascular outcomes associated with CHEMICALNOTIN in hypertension and chronic heart failure (CHF). FINDINGS: Compared with other ARBs, CHEMICALIN demonstrates the strongest binding affinity to the GENEIN. Clinical trials have demonstrated that CHEMICALIN is well tolerated in combination with diuretics or GENEIN blockers (CCBs), making it a suitable treatment option for patients whose hypertension is not adequately controlled by monotherapy. Subsequently, CHEMICALNOTIN became the only ARB licensed in the UK to treat patients with CHF and left ventricular ejection fraction < or = 40% as add-on therapy to an ACEi or when an ACEi is not tolerated. Studies in patients with symptomatic HF have indicated that CHEMICALNOTIN treatment was associated with significant relative risk reductions in cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisation due to CHF. CONCLUSIONS: There are clear indications that the clinical benefits of CHEMICALNOTIN may extend beyond its proven antihypertensive effects to a wider range of complications across the cardiovascular continuum, including diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, atherosclerosis and stroke. Such results suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN treatment may offer significant patient benefits as well as practical advantages over conventional treatment.
23590882	Interacting GENENOTIN-Like Proteins in Phloem Regulate Lateral Root Initiation in Arabidopsis. Molecular, genetic, and electrophysiological evidence indicates that at least one of the plant GENENOTIN-like molecules, GENENOTIN, functions as an GENENOTIN at the plasma membrane. The aspect of plant physiology, growth, or development to which GENENOTIN contributes is an open question. Protein localization studies performed here provide important information. In roots, GENENOTIN and the related GENENOTIN protein were present primarily in the phloem, especially in the vicinity of the sieve plates. GENENOTIN was expressed in most cells of the growing primary root but was not enriched in the phloem, including the sieve plate area. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN physically interacted with each other better than with themselves as evidenced by a biophotonic assay performed in human embryonic kidney cells and Nicotiana benthamiana leaf cells. GENENOTIN interacted poorly with itself or the other two GENENOTIN. Mutations in GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, or GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN caused the same and equally severe phenotype, namely, a large overproduction and aberrant placement of lateral root primordia. Loss of GENENOTIN did not affect lateral root primordia. These results support the hypothesis that apoplastic CHEMICALIN acting through heteromeric GENEIN/GENEIN channels affect lateral root development via CHEMICALNOTIN signaling in the phloem.
23159790	Purification and structural characterisation of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN) from Thai banded tiger wasp (Vespa affinis) venom. The Thai banded tiger wasp (Vespa affinis) is one of the most dangerous vespid species in Southeast Asia, and stinging accidents involving this species still cause fatalities. In the present study, four forms of GENENOTIN were identified through a proteomics approach. Two of these enzymes were purified by reverse-phase chromatography, and their biochemical properties were characterised. These enzymes, designated GENENOTIN, are not glycoproteins and exist as 33441.5 and 33474.4 Da proteins, which corresponded with the 34-kDa band observed via SDS-PAGE. The thermal stabilities of these enzymes were stronger than snake venom. Using an in vivo assay, no difference was found in the toxicities of the different isoforms. Furthermore, the toxicity of these enzymes does not appear to be correlated with their GENENOTIN activity. The cDNAs of the full-length version of GENEIN revealed that the GENEIN gene consists of a 1005-bp ORF, which encodes 334 CHEMICALIN residues, and 67- and 227-bp 5' and 3' UTRs, respectively. The two isoforms are different by three CHEMICALNOTIN substitutions, resulting in the replacement of two CHEMICALNOTIN. Through sequence alignment, these enzymes were classified as members of the GENENOTIN family. The structural modelling of GENENOTIN used the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) as a template because it has GENENOTIN activity, which demonstrated that this enzyme belongs to the GENENOTIN fold family. The GENEIN structure, which is composed of seven Î±-helixes and eleven Î²-strands, contains the Î²-strand/ÉSer/Î±-helix structural motif, which contains the CHEMICALIN-X-CHEMICALIN-X-CHEMICALIN consensus sequence. The typical surface structures that play important roles in substrate selectivity (the lid domain and the Î²9 loop) were shortened in the GENENOTIN structure, which suggests that this enzyme may only exhibit GENENOTIN activity. Moreover, the observed insertion of CHEMICALIN into the lid domain of the GENEIN structure is rare. We therefore propose that this CHEMICALIN residue might be involved in the stability and activity of GENEIN.
15982930	CHEMICALIN inhibits growth of tumors through GENEIN degradation independent of antiangiogenesis. CHEMICALNOTIN is an antiangiogenic drug and is clinically useful in a number of cancers. However, the molecular mechanism by which CHEMICALNOTIN exerts its antitumor effects is poorly understood. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between antiangiogenesis and antitumor effects of CHEMICALNOTIN and to explore the molecular mechanism for its antitumor activity. We evaluated the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on the growth of human tumor cells expressing (MCF-7 and HL-60) or not expressing (HeLa and K562) GENENOTIN in vitro. We also studied the effects of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN, GENEIN or GENEIN expression, GENEIN, GENEIN, GSH and GENEIN in these cells. CHEMICALNOTIN could inhibit tumor growth in a concentration-dependent manner in MCF-7 and HL-60; its IC50s for them were 18.36+/-2.34 and 22.14+/-2.15 microM, respectively, while this effect was not observed in HeLa and K562. CHEMICALIN reduced GENEIN expression accompanied by a decrease of GENEIN protein, GENEIN, GENEIN, GSH and an increased GENEIN, but had no effect on that of GENEIN, in MCF-7 and HL-60. Moreover, cells not expressing GENENOTIN were insensitive to the growth-inhibitory and effects on GENENOTIN of CHEMICALNOTIN. In our mouse xenograft model of OVCAR-3 and HCT-8, we found that CHEMICALNOTIN could decrease intratumoral microvessel density in both tumors; it exerted antitumor effects only on OVCAR-3 expressing GENENOTIN but did not on HCT-8 not expressing GENENOTIN. Effect of CHEMICALIN on GENEIN and GENEIN in vivo was consistent with that of in vitro. These results demonstrated that CHEMICALIN might inhibit growth of tumors through GENEIN degradation independent of antiangiogenesis.
23614730	Toxicological impact of inhaled electric mosquito-repellent liquid on the rat: a hematological, GENENOTIN indications, oxidative stress and tumor markers. Abstract Context: High malaria burden has led to the increased use of insecticides in the tropics and subtropics. This study thus aimed at assessing the hematological effects alteration of CHEMICALNOTIN insecticide exposure using the experimental animal model. Objective: A commonly available Electric Mosquito-Repellent Liquid CHEMICALNOTIN insecticide containing CHEMICALNOTIN 1.6% w/w is widely used for mosquito control in Saudi Arabia. The immunotoxic effects after inhalation exposures to the preparation for a continuous period of 24, 48, and 72âh were investigated in rats. Methods and materials: Rats were exposed to CHEMICALNOTIN 1.6% w/w by inhalation for 72 consecutive hours. Total blood count, blood indices of GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) were assayed. Results: The administration of CHEMICALIN 1.6% w/w created significant increased changes in the levels of total WBC, lymphocytes, RBC, GENEIN, packed cell volume, platelets, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular GENEIN in rats after 24, 48, and 72âh of continuous inhalation; however, there was a significant reduction in neutrophils at transient reduction in the monocytes after 24 and 48âh to return to normal after 72âh. Significant increases in the levels of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN were recorded. GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN did not exhibit any change. Conclusions: Continuous inhalation to CHEMICALNOTIN 1.6% insecticides poses toxicity on hematological variables. It is also concluded that CHEMICALIN group of insecticide may cause hematological, biochemical, GENEIN disturbances and possible mutagenic damage to the tissues.
23455314	Contribution of the m1 transmembrane helix and pre-m1 region to positive allosteric modulation and gating of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN are GENENOTIN whose function is critical for normal excitatory synaptic transmission in the brain and whose dysfunction has been implicated in several neurologic conditions. GENENOTIN function is subject to extensive allosteric regulation both by endogenous compounds and by exogenous small molecules. Elucidating the structural determinants and mechanism of action by which allosteric regulators control gating will enhance our understanding of GENENOTIN activation and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Here, we investigated the structural determinants for CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), a GluN2C/2D-selective positive allosteric modulator. We show that CHEMICALIN does not bind to the CHEMICALIN-terminal domain of the GENEIN and does not share structural determinants with modulators acting at the agonist-binding domain dimer interface or GENEIN pore. Rather, we identified critical determinants of CHEMICALNOTIN modulation in the region near the first transmembrane helix of GluN2D, including in a putative pre-M1 cuff helix that may influence channel gating. We also show that mutations within the GluN2D pre-M1 region alter open probability of the GENENOTIN. These results suggest a novel site of action for potentiation of GENENOTIN by small molecules and implicate the pre-M1 region in GENENOTIN gating.
23556446	Association of ATP-binding cassette transporter variants with the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Aim: A number of studies have demonstrated that ABCB1 and BCRP (ABCG2) actively transport AÎ². We aimed to investigate the association of genetic variants of selected multidrug transporters with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in histopathologically confirmed AD cases and controls. Materials & methods: DNA from brain tissue of 71 AD cases with Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) neuropathological stages B/C and 81 controls was genotyped for selected variants in ABCA1, ABCA7, ABCB1, ABCC2 and ABCG2. In addition, the APOE4 status was analyzed. Results: The novel ABCA7 SNP, rs3752246, tended to be associated with AD in our study. Variants in ABCB1 were significantly less frequent in AD cases older than 65 years of age and among females. This association of ABCB1 2677G>T (rs2032582) was more pronounced in APOE4-negative cases (p = 0.005). However, only ABCC2 3972C>T (rs3740066) was significantly associated with AD risk after logistic regression analysis including all variants. Other transporters showed a lack of association. Conclusion: Our results support the hypothesis that ABCB1 and possibly other ABC-transporters are involved in the process of AÎ² accumulation in the aging brain and may modulate the risk for AD in an allele-specific manner, and thus might represent a new target for prevention and treatment of AD.

23256442	Dandelion leaf extract protects against liver injury induced by methionine- and choline-deficient diet in mice. We investigated the hepatoprotective effects of the extract of dandelion leaves (EDL) on a murine model of methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). C57BL/6 mice were fed for 4 weeks with one of the following diets: control diet (Cont), MCD diet (MCD), MCD diet supplemented with EDL at 200 mg/kg body weightÂ·daily (MCD+D200), and MCD diet supplemented with EDL at 500 mg/kg body weightÂ·daily (MCD+D500). Hepatic function was assessed by evaluating the following parameters: liver histology; plasma levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), triglyceride (TG), malondialdehyde (MDA), and reduced glutathione (GSH); expression levels of TNF-Î± and IL-6; and levels of caspase-3 and pJNK/JNK protein. Histopathological evaluations revealed that addition of EDL to the MCD diet dampens the severity of the clinical signs of NASH. Moreover, EDL led to a significant decrease in the serum levels of ALT, hepatic TG, and MDA, and in the expression levels of TNF-Î±, and IL-6; on the contrary, the levels of reduced GSH increased. At the post-transcriptional level, EDL significantly decreased the activation of procaspase-3 to active caspase-3, and the phosphorylation of JNK. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of EDL on NASH are mainly due to its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities.
17325667	A novel GENEIN switch is a mechanism of CHEMICALIN resistance in gastrointestinal stromal tumors. GENENOTIN or GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) activating mutations are the pathogenic mechanisms that characterize gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). Despite excellent responses to CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN), patients are relapsing. We developed an CHEMICALNOTIN-resistant GIST cell line (GIST-R) from the CHEMICALNOTIN-sensitive GIST882 cell line (GIST-S) by growing these cells in CHEMICALNOTIN. Gene expression profiling (GEP) of GIST-S, GIST-R cells and two CHEMICALIN resistant GIST patients demonstrated that GENEIN is downregulated implying a major role in CHEMICALIN resistance. Instead, GIST-R cells have acquired CHEMICALNOTIN resistance by overexpressing the GENENOTIN - GENENOTIN - in a 'GENENOTIN switch'. Further, the two CHEMICALNOTIN resistant GIST patients express GENENOTIN and not GENENOTIN, seen by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting of the GIST-S and GIST-R cells confirmed the switch from GENENOTIN to GENENOTIN. In GIST-R, GENEIN is CHEMICALIN phosphorylated and its ligand GENENOTIN is overexpressed implying autocrine activation. The GENENOTIN switch is associated with a morphological change from spindle to epithelioid. Molecular modeling of the GENEIN of mutant GENEIN (GENEIN) and GENEIN showed no binding to CHEMICALIN but efficient binding to CHEMICALIN, a novel GENEIN/GENEIN GENEIN inhibitor. CHEMICALNOTIN synergizes with CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) and is cytotoxic to GIST cells.
9466983	Differential interactions of heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans with the selectins. Implications for the use of unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins as therapeutic agents. The selectins are calcium-dependent C-type lectins that bind certain sialylated, fucosylated, sulfated glycoprotein ligands. L-selectin also recognizes endothelial proteoglycans in a calcium-dependent manner, via heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains enriched in unsubstituted glucosamine units. We now show that these HS chains can also bind P-selectin, but not E-selectin. However, while L-selectin binding requires micromolar levels of free calcium, P-selectin recognition is largely divalent cation-independent. Despite this, HS chains bound to P-selectin are eluted by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), but only at high concentrations. Porcine intestinal mucosal (mast cell-derived) heparin (PIM-heparin) shows similar properties, with no binding to E-selectin, calcium-dependent binding of a subfraction to L-selectin and to P-selectin, and calcium-independent binding of a larger fraction to P-selectin, the latter being disrupted by high EDTA concentrations. Analysis of defined heparin fragment pools shows a size dependence for interaction, with tetradecasaccharides showing easily detectable binding to L- and P-selectin affinity columns. L-selectin binding fragments include more heavily sulfated and epimerized regions and, as with the endothelial HS chains, they are enriched in free amino groups. The P-selectin binding component includes this fraction as well as some less highly modified regions. Thus, endothelium-derived HS chains and mast cell-derived heparins could play a role in modulating the biology of selectins in vivo. Notably, P- and L-selectin binding to sialyl-Lewisx and to HL-60 cells (which are known to carry the native ligand PSGL-1) is inhibited by unfractionated pharmaceutical heparin preparations at concentrations 12-50-fold lower than those recommended for effective anticoagulation in vivo. In contrast, two low molecular weight heparins currently considered as clinical replacements for unfractionated heparin are much poorer inhibitors. Thus, patients undergoing heparin therapy for other reasons may be experiencing clinically significant inhibition of L- and P-selectin function, and the current switchover to low-molecular weight heparins may come at some loss of this effect. Low-dose unfractionated heparin should be investigated as a treatment option for acute and chronic diseases in which P- and L-selectin play pathological roles.
23239825	Differentiation of opioid drug effects by hierarchical multi-site phosphorylation. Differences in the ability of opioid drugs to promote regulated endocytosis of Î¼-opioid receptors are related to their tendency to produce drug tolerance and dependence. Here we show that drug-specific differences in receptor internalization are determined by a conserved, 10-residue sequence in the receptor's carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic tail. Diverse opioids induce receptor phosphorylation at serine (S)375, present in the middle of this sequence, but opioids differ markedly in their ability to drive higher-order phosphorylation on flanking residues [threonine (T)370, T376, and T379]. Multi-phosphorylation is required for the endocytosis-promoting activity of this sequence and occurs both sequentially and hierarchically, with S375 representing the initiating site. Higher-order phosphorylation involving T370, T376, and T379 specifically requires GRK2/3 isoforms, and the same sequence controls opioid receptor internalization in neurons. These results reveal a biochemical mechanism differentiating the endocytic activity of opioid drugs.
19568704	Effects of changeover from CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN on postprandial CHEMICALNOTIN in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. INTRODUCTION: In this study, we examined the effects of the GENEIN inhibitors CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN on postprandial plasma CHEMICALIN and serum triglyceride levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: Twenty-one Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes were enrolled in this study. Subjects had been treated with CHEMICALNOTIN for at least 3 months. They underwent a 400 kcal balanced food meal tolerance test before and 8 weeks after the changeover from CHEMICALNOTIN to CHEMICALNOTIN. Subjects were divided into two groups: the first group (low-dose group; n=11) was changed over from 0.6 mg/day CHEMICALNOTIN to 150 mg/day CHEMICALNOTIN, and the other (high-dose group; n=10) from 0.9 mg/day CHEMICALNOTIN to 300 mg/day acarbose. RESULTS: The increment rate of postprandial plasma CHEMICALNOTIN ([plasma CHEMICALNOTIN 2 hours after test meal - fasting CHEMICALNOTIN]/fasting CHEMICALNOTIN) decreased from 34.7%+/-23.9% to 25.0%+/-24.6% (P=0.13) in the low-dose group, and decreased significantly from 56.1%+/-53.1% to 31.5%+/-36.0% (P=0.03) in the high-dose group after changeover. However, there were no significant changes in blood GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) levels before and after changeover in either group. The increment rate of postprandial serum CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) ([serum CHEMICALNOTIN 2 hours after test meal - fasting CHEMICALNOTIN]/fasting CHEMICALNOTIN) decreased significantly only in the high-dose group (52.4%+/-60.0% to 24.3%+/-16.6%) (P=0.05). No significant changes in serum high-density lipoprotein CHEMICALNOTIN levels were observed in either group, whereas serum GENENOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN levels decreased significantly from 3.20+/-0.25 to 2.65+/-0.18 mmol/L (P=0.04), only in the high-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with type 2 diabetes our findings suggest that CHEMICALNOTIN 300 mg/day is superior to CHEMICALNOTIN 0.9 mg/day in improving postprandial hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia.
23535516	Modulation of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling in GENENOTIN-induced inhibition of local and systemic responses to myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. The GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathways have been shown to play a cardioprotective role. We previously gave evidence that GENENOTIN afford cardioprotection in conditions of myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Here we aimed to investigate the influence of GENENOTIN on the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling in cardiac and systemic responses to prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion. Ischemia was produced in rats by ligature of the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30min. At the end of the 2-h reperfusion, western blot analysis of the cardioprotective transcription factors GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, the inflammatory mediator GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the pro-apoptotic factors GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), the anti-apoptotic protein GENENOTIN, as well as of the cardioprotective enzyme GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN), was performed in the left ventricle and spleen. Intravenous treatment, during coronary artery occlusion, with the GENENOTIN analogs [CHEMICALIN(4), CHEMICALIN(7)]GENEIN (NDP-GENEIN) and GENENOTIN [GENENOTIN], induced a left ventricle up-regulation of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-dependent), and a reduction in GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN levels; these effects of NDP-GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN were associated with over-expression of the pro-survival proteins GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, and marked decrease of the myocardial infarct size. GENENOTIN treatment did not affect left ventricle GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN-dependent) and GENENOTIN levels. In the spleen, NDP-GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN induced similar effects on the expression of the above transcription factors/proteins, except for GENENOTIN (down-regulated) and GENENOTIN (unaffected). Blockade of GENEIN and GENEIN pathways with CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, respectively, abrogated the myocardial infarct size reduction by NDP-GENENOTIN. These results indicate that GENENOTIN inhibit local and systemic inflammatory and apoptotic cascades triggered by prolonged myocardial ischemia/reperfusion, with consequent reduction in myocardium infarct size, seemingly via activation of the GENENOTIN/GENENOTIN signaling and with modulation of an GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN unrelated) signaling pathway.
12392782	GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitors protect against mononuclear phagocyte neurotoxicity. Neuroinflammation and oxidative stress are believed to be contributing factors to neurodegeneration in normal aging, as well as in age-related neurological disorders. Reactive microglia are found in increased numbers in aging brain and are prominently associated with lesions in such age-related degenerative conditions as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). In vitro, stimulated microglia or microglial-like cells secrete neurotoxic materials and are generators of free radicals through their respiratory burst system. Agents that suppress microglial activation are therefore candidates for neuroprotection. We have developed quantitative in vitro assays for measuring neurotoxicity of microglia or other mononuclear phagocytes. Neuronal like SH-SY5Y cells are cultured in supernatants from activated cells of the human monocytic THP-1 line and their survival is followed. Respiratory burst is directly measured on the activated cells. We tested inhibitors of the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) or the GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) pathways as possible neuroprotective agents. The GENEIN pathway generates inflammatory CHEMICALIN, while the GENEIN pathway generates inflammatory CHEMICALIN. We found that inhibitors of both these pathways suppressed neurotoxicity in a dose-dependent fashion. They included the GENENOTIN inhibitor indomethacin; the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN; the mixed GENEIN/GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN; the CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) derivatives of CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN; the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN; and the GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitor CHEMICALIN. The GENENOTIN inhibitor also reduced respiratory burst activity in a more potent manner than indomethacin. Combinations of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN inhibitors were more effective than single inhibitors. The data suggest that both GENENOTIN inhibitors and GENENOTIN inhibitors may be neuroprotective in vivo by suppressing toxic actions of microglia/macrophages, and that combinations of the two might have greater therapeutic potential than single inhibitors of either class.
23639362	Cyperi Rhizoma inhibits the CHEMICALNOTIN-induced reduction in nigrostriatal dopaminergenic neurons in CHEMICALNOTIN-deprived mice. ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Cyperi Rhizoma has commonly been used for the treatment of gynecological and neuropsychiatric disorders in traditional medicine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the estrogenic properties and neuroprotective effects of Cyperi Rhizoma under CHEMICALNOTIN-deprived condition in female mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the CHEMICALNOTIN-like effect of Cyperi Rhizoma extract (CRE), we measured luciferase expression after transfection of a promoter construct containing an GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and treatment of CRE. To evaluate the neuroprotective effect of CRE, we measured striatal CHEMICALNOTIN, movement ability, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) immunoreactivity, and apoptosis-related protein expression levels after treatment of CRE either with or without CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN) in ovariectomized female mice. RESULTS: CRE significantly induced the luciferase expression driven by an GENENOTIN in PC12 cells, a dopaminergic cell line, in a dose-dependent manner. In mice, CHEMICALNOTIN significantly decreased the levels of CHEMICALNOTIN in the striatum and behavior performance; in contrast, both CRE and CHEMICALNOTIN (EB) recovered these parameters to normal levels. CRE and EB treatment also recovered GENEIN immunopositive fibers and cells, respectively, from CHEMICALIN toxicity. Additionally, CHEMICALIN significantly down-regulated GENEIN expression in the mitochondria of dopaminergic cells in the SN, followed by an increase in GENEIN expression, GENEIN translocation to the cytosol, andcleaved-GENEIN expression, whereas these were inhibited by CRE or EB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide the first evidence that CRE has CHEMICALNOTIN-like and neuroprotective effects on dopaminergic neurons in CHEMICALNOTIN-deprived mice treated with CHEMICALNOTIN-toxin.
16291771	New progestagens for contraceptive use. The progestins have different pharmacologic properties depending upon the parent molecule, usually testosterone or progesterone (P), from which they are derived. Very small structural changes in the parent molecule may induce considerable differences in the activity of the derivative. In hormonal contraceptives, progestins represent the major agent designed for suppressing ovulation and are used in combination with estrogen (E) usually ethinyl-estradiol (EE). The development of new generations of progestins with improved selectivity profiles has been a great challenge. Steroidal and nonsteroidal progesterone receptor (PR) agonists have been synthesized as well, although the latter are still in a very early stage of development. Several new progestins, have been synthesized in the last two decades. These include dienogest (DNG), drospirenone (DRSP), Nestorone (NES), nomegestrol acetate (NOMAc) and trimegestone (TMG). These new progestins have been designed to have no androgenic or estrogenic actions and to be closer in activity to the physiological hormone P. DRSP differs from the classic progestins as it is derived from spirolactone. It is essentially an antimineralocorticoid steroid with no androgenic effect but a partial antiandrogenic effect. The antiovulatory potency of the different progestins varies. TMG and NES are the most potent progestins synthesized to date, followed by two of the older progestins, keto-desogestrel (keto-DSG) and levonorgestrel (LNG). The new molecules TMG, DRSP and DNG also have antiandrogenic activity. Striking differences exist regarding the side effects among the progestins and the combination with EE leads to other reactions related to the E itself and whether the associated progestin counterbalances, more or less, the estrogenic action. The 19-norprogesterone molecules and the new molecules DRSP and DNG are not androgenic and, therefore, have no negative effect on the lipid profile. Given their pharmacological properties, it is likely that the new progestins may have neutral effects on metabolic or vascular risks. However, this hypothesis must be confirmed in large clinical trials.
23386390	Add-on therapy with the GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN improves glycemic control in GENENOTIN-treated Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The effect of add-on therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN on glycemic control was prospectively investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) receiving GENENOTIN alone or GENENOTIN combined with oral antidiabetic drugs. Seventy-one patients were evaluated (38 men and 33 women aged 63.9Â±10.2 years). They were divided into three groups, which were 45 patients receiving premixed GENENOTIN twice daily, 15 patients receiving multiple daily GENENOTIN injections, and 11 patients receiving basal GENENOTIN with oral antidiabetic drugs (basal GENENOTIN therapy). Concomitant oral drugs included CHEMICALNOTIN, GENENOTIN inhibitors and CHEMICALNOTIN. The GENEIN (GENEIN) of all patients improved significantly from 8.1Â±1.2% to 7.6Â±1.1% after 12 weeks of add-on therapy with CHEMICALIN (p<0.01), and the GENENOTIN dosage was reduced from 27.3Â±15.8 U/day to 24.5Â±16.5 U/day (p<0.001). Body weight did not change after the start of concomitant therapy and severe hypoglycemia was not observed. The baseline GENEIN and GENEIN levels were identified as factors that predicted the response to add-on therapy with CHEMICALIN. These findings suggest that add-on therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN can be expected to achieve improvement of poor glycemic control irrespective of a patient's demographic profile. Stratified analysis based on the GENENOTIN regimen revealed a stronger antidiabetic effect and a high efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN when it was added to basal GENENOTIN therapy. The results of this investigation confirmed that add-on therapy with CHEMICALNOTIN to various GENENOTIN regimens could improve glycemic control without severe hypoglycemia and/or weight gain.
23194826	Effect of blood-retinal barrier development on formation of CHEMICALNOTIN nuclear cataract in rat. CHEMICALNOTIN cataract, as an experimental animal model of nuclear cataract to mimic human senile cataract, is produced only when overdose CHEMICALNOTIN is injected to neonatal rats before eyelid opening. To clarify the cause of age differences on CHEMICALNOTIN cataract formation in rats, mRNA expression of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN, as well as GENEIN activity in Wistar rat lens at different ages were assayed, level of lipid peroxidation, extent of lens damage induced by CHEMICALIN and barricade function of blood-retinal barrier (BRB) were investigated. The results showed that mRNA expressions and activity of antioxidant enzymes in neonatal rat lens before eyelid opening were the highest and then decreased with age, and revealed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using CHEMICALNOTIN as tracer that higher CHEMICALNOTIN content entering eyes injured lens and resulted in cataract formation for immature BRB before eyelid opening, moreover, a little CHEMICALNOTIN content entering eyes was not enough to induce cataract formation after eyelid opening because of mature BRB.
19482847	Lowering interleukin-1 activity with anakinra improves myocardial deformation in rheumatoid arthritis. OBJECTIVE: Inhibition of interleukin-1 activity improves nitro-oxidative stress, endothelial and coronary function. The authors investigated (a) the association of nitro-oxidative stress and endothelial function with myocardial deformation, (b) the effects of anakinra, an interleukin-1a receptor antagonist on myocardial deformation in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). METHODS: The authors compared 46 RA patients to 23 normal controls. 23 patients received anakinra (150 mg subcutaneously once daily) and 23 patients a 5-mg increase of prednisolone dose for 30 days. At baseline and post-treatment this study assessed (a) the left ventricular (LV) longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain and strain rate, using speckle tracking echocardiography, (b) the coronary flow reserve (CFR), (c) the flow-mediated endothelial-dependent dilation of the brachial artery (FMD) and (d) nitrotyrosine (NT) and malondialdehyde blood levels. RESULTS: Patients had impaired baseline myocardial deformation indices compared to controls (p<0.05). CFR and NT levels were related to longitudinal strain, systolic and diastolic strain rate, circumferential strain and systolic strain rate (p<0.05). FMD was related to longitudinal and circumferential diastolic strain rate (p<0.01). Compared to baseline, anakinra-treated patients increased the longitudinal strain (-17.8% (3.7%) vs -22.1% (3.5%)), systolic (-1.02 (0.23) l/s vs -1.25 (0.23) l/s) and diastolic (0.96 (0.37) l/s vs 1.20 (0.39) l/s) longitudinal strain rate, circumferential strain and strain rate (p<0.05 for all comparisons). No significant changes were observed among prednisolone-treated patients CONCLUSIONS: Myocardial deformation is impaired in RA patients and is related to nitro-oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction. Chronic inhibition of IL-1 improves LV deformation in parallel with endothelial function and nitro-oxidative stress.
16766717	A molecular mechanism of CHEMICALNOTIN protection against cytotoxicity of reactive CHEMICALNOTIN species in osteoblasts. We demonstrated previously that exogenous CHEMICALNOTIN has a protective action against cell death by CHEMICALNOTIN in cultured osteoblasts through a mechanism associated with its antioxidative property. In the present study, we have evaluated possible participation of GENEIN (GENEIN) responsible for the bidirectional membrane transport of CHEMICALIN in the cytoprotective property in osteoblasts. Expression of the GENENOTIN isoform was found in cultured rat calvarial osteoblasts and in osteoblasts located on mouse tibia at both mRNA and protein levels. The accumulation of CHEMICALNOTIN occurred in a temperature- and pH-dependent manner in osteoblasts cultured for 7 days with high sensitivity to a specific GENENOTIN inhibitor, whereas CHEMICALNOTIN was released into extracellular spaces from cultured osteoblasts in a fashion sensitive to the GENENOTIN inhibitor. Transient overexpression of the GENENOTIN isoform led to reduced vulnerability to the cytotoxicity of CHEMICALNOTIN with an increased activity of CHEMICALNOTIN accumulation in murine osteoblastic MC3T3-E1 cells. Ovariectomy significantly decreased the content of CHEMICALNOTIN in femoral bone marrows in mice in vivo, whereas daily i.p. administration of CHEMICALNOTIN at 0.25 g/kg significantly prevented alterations of several histomorphometric parameters as well as cancellous bone loss in femurs by ovariectomy on 28 days after the operation. These results suggest that GENENOTIN may be functionally expressed by osteoblasts to play a pivotal role in mechanisms related to the cytoprotective property of CHEMICALNOTIN.
23300287	Lower Adiponectin Levels at First Trimester of Pregnancy Are Associated With Increased Insulin Resistance and Higher Risk of Developing Gestational Diabetes Mellitus. OBJECTIVETo evaluate the associations between adiponectin levels and 1) the risk of developing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and 2) insulin resistance/sensitivity, Î²-cell function, and compensation indices in a prospective cohort representative of the general population of pregnant women.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe performed anthropometric measurements and collected blood samples at 1st (6-13 weeks) and 2nd (24-28 weeks) trimesters. Diagnosis of GDM was made at 2nd trimester, based on a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (International Association of Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Group criteria). Insulin was measured (ELISA; Luminex) to estimate homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), Î²-cell function (HOMA-B), insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), insulin secretion (AUC(insulin/glucose)), and Î²-cell compensation (insulin secretion sensitivity index-2). Adiponectin was measured by radioimmunoassay.RESULTSAmong the 445 participants included in this study, 38 women developed GDM. Women who developed GDM had lower 1st-trimester adiponectin levels (9.67 Â± 3.84 vs. 11.92 Â± 4.59 Âµg/mL in women with normal glucose tolerance). Lower adiponectin levels were associated with higher risk of developing GDM (OR, 1.12 per 1 Âµg/mL decrease of adiponectin levels; P = 0.02, adjusted for BMI and HbA(1c) at 1st trimester). Adiponectin levels at 1st and 2nd trimesters were associated with HOMA-IR (both: r = -0.22, P < 0.0001) and Matsuda index (r = 0.28, P < 0.0001, and r = 0.29, P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounding factors, we found no significant association with HOMA-B and AUC(insulin/glucose).CONCLUSIONSPregnant women with lower adiponectin levels at 1st trimester have higher levels of insulin resistance and are more likely to develop GDM independently of adiposity or glycemic measurements.
23201337	Reduced plasma oxytocin levels in female patients with borderline personality disorder. The neuropeptide oxytocin is involved in social cognition and interaction across species and plays a crucial role in the regulation of affiliative behaviors. Oxytocin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), but also in plasma or urine, have been shown to be negatively associated with childhood traumata, aggressive behavior, and suicide attempts. Recently, an altered activity of the oxytocin system has been discussed to play a prominent role in borderline personality disorder (BPD), which is thought to be closely related to traumatic experiences in childhood and is characterized by (para)suicidal behaviors as well as aggressive outbursts. In the present study, we compared plasma oxytocin levels of women with and without BPD in the follicular phase and assessed the relationship between oxytocin concentrations and childhood traumata. Women diagnosed with BPD had significantly reduced oxytocin concentrations, even after controlling for estrogen, progesterone, and contraceptive intake. In addition, plasma oxytocin correlated negatively with experiences of childhood traumata, in particular with emotional neglect and abuse. The results of mediation analyses do not support a model of oxytocin being a prominent mediator in the link between childhood trauma and BPD. Thus, the findings indicate dysregulations in the oxytocin system of patients diagnosed with BPD with more longitudinal research being necessary to disentangle the relationship between childhood adversities, oxytocin system, and psychopathology.
17034586	Interferon-gamma is causatively involved in experimental inflammatory bowel disease in mice. Cytokines may be crucially involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), but it remains controversial whether interferon (IFN)-gamma, a typical proinflammatory cytokine, is an essential mediator to cause the disorders. In the present study, IFN-gamma(-/-) and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were fed 2.5% dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days, in order to investigate DSS-induced intestinal inflammation. The DSS-treated WT mice exhibited a robust production of IFN-gamma in the gut, a remarkable loss of body weight, as well as high rate of mortality (60%). In striking contrast, IFN-gamma deficient mice did not develop DSS-induced colitis, as indicated by the maintenance of body weight and survival rate of 100%. Severe intestinal inflammation was demonstrated exclusively in WT animals in terms of the shortening of the bowel as well as the elevation of the disease activity index, myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and serum haptoglobin level. Histological study of DSS-treated WT intestine revealed disruption of mucosal epithelium and massive infiltration of inflammatory cells, while the organ from IFN-gamma(-/-) mice remained virtually normal in appearance. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses indicated abundant production of three chemokines, i.e. monokine induced by interferon-gamma (MIG), interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), in the DSS-irritated intestine of WT but not of IFN-gamma(-/-) mice. The present results demonstrate clearly that IFN-gamma plays indispensable roles in the initiation of DSS colitis, and some chemokines are produced in an IFN-gamma-dependent fashion.
18686730	Formoterol in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Bronchodilators represent the hallmark of symptomatic treatment of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). There are four categories of bronchodilators: anticholinergics, methylxanthines, short-acting beta2-agonists, and long-acting beta2-agonists such as formoterol. Significant research has been performed to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of formoterol in the therapeutic field of COPD. Formoterol exhibits a rapid onset of bronchodilation similar to that observed with salbutamol, yet its long bronchodilatory duration is comparable to salmeterol. In addition, formoterol presents with a clear superiority in lung function improvement compared with either ipratropium bromide or oral theophylline, while its efficacy improves when administered in combination with ipratropium. Formoterol has been shown to better reduce dynamic hyperinflation, which is responsible for exercise intolerance and dyspnea in COPD patients, compared with other bronchodilators, whereas it exerts synergistic effect with tiotropium. Moreover, formoterol reduces exacerbations, increases days free of use of rescue medication and improves patients' quality of life and disease symptoms. Formoterol has a favorable safety profile and is better tolerated than theophylline. Collectively, data extracted from multicenter clinical trials support formoterol as a valid therapeutic option in the treatment of COPD.
23247008	Comparative genomics, molecular evolution and computational modeling of GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN genes encode mitochondrial enzymes capable of metabolizing CHEMICALNOTIN and other biological CHEMICALNOTIN in the body. GENEIN, another mitochondrial enzyme sharing 72% identity with GENEIN, is also capable of metabolizing CHEMICALIN but has a tissue distribution and pattern of activity distinct from that of GENENOTIN. Bioinformatic analyses of several vertebrate genomes were undertaken using known GENEIN and GENEIN CHEMICALIN sequences. Phylogenetic analysis of many representative vertebrate species (including fish, amphibians, birds and mammals) indicated the presence of GENENOTIN in many mammalian species and in frogs (Xenopus tropicalis); no evidence was found for GENENOTIN in the genomes of birds, reptiles or fish. Predicted GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunit sequences and structures were highly conserved, including residues previously shown to be involved in catalysis and coenzyme binding for GENENOTIN. Studies of GENENOTIN sequences supported the hypothesis that the GENENOTIN1 gene originated in early vertebrates from a retrotransposition of the vertebrate GENENOTIN gene. Given the high degree of similarity between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN, it is surprising that individuals with an inactivating mutation in GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN*2) do not exhibit a compensatory increase in GENENOTIN activity. We hypothesized that the similarity between the two GENENOTIN would allow for dominant negative heterotetramerization between the inactive GENENOTIN mutants and GENENOTIN. Computational-based molecular modeling studies examining predicted protein-protein interactions indicated that heterotetramerization between GENENOTIN and GENENOTIN subunits was highly probable and may partially explain a lack of compensation by GENENOTIN in GENENOTIN(â)2 individuals.
23368901	Influence of chain length and double bond on the aqueous behavior of choline carboxylate soaps. In preceding studies, we demonstrated that choline carboxylates ChC(m) with alkyl chain lengths of m = 12 - 18 are highly water-soluble (for m = 12, soluble up to 93 wt % soap and 0 Â°C). In addition, choline soaps are featured by an extraordinary lyotropic phase behavior. With decreasing water concentration, the following phases were found: micellar phase (L(1)), discontinuous cubic phase (I(1)' and I(1)"), hexagonal phase (H(1)), bicontinuous cubic phase (V(1)), and lamellar phase (L(Î±)). The present work is also focused on the lyotropic phase behavior of choline soaps but with shorter alkyl chains or different alkyl chain properties. We have investigated the aqueous phase behavior of choline soaps with C(8) and C(10) chain-lengths (choline octanoate and choline decanoate) and with a C(18) chain-length with a cis-double bond (choline oleate). We found that choline decanoate follows the lyotropic phase behavior of the longer-chain homologues mentioned above. Choline octanoate in water shows no discontinuous cubic phases, but an extended, isotropic micellar solution phase. In addition, choline octanoate is at the limit between a surfactant and a hydrotrope. The double bond in choline oleate leads also to a better solubility in water and a decrease of the solubilization temperature. It also influences the Gaussian curvature of the aggregates which results in a loss of discontinuous cubic phases in the binary phase diagram. The different lyotropic mesophases were identified by the penetration scan technique with polarizing light microscope and visual observations. To clarify the structural behavior small (SAXS) and wide (WAXS) angle X-ray scattering were performed. To further characterize the extended, isotropic micellar solution phase in the binary phase diagram of choline octanoate viscosity and conductivity measurements were also carried out.
23633521	Loss of Kruppel-like Factor 3 (KLF3/BKLF) leads to upregulation of the insulin-sensitizing factor adipolin (FAM132A/CTRP12/C1qdc2). KrÃ¼ppel-like Factor 3 (KLF3) is a transcriptional regulator that we have shown to be involved in the regulation of adipogenesis in vitro. Here we report that KLF3 null mice are lean and protected from diet-induced obesity and glucose intolerance. On a chow diet, plasma levels of leptin are decreased, and adiponectin is increased. Despite significant reductions in body weight and adiposity, wildtype and knockout animals show equivalent energy intake, expenditure and excretion. To investigate the molecular events underlying these observations, we used microarray analysis to compare gene expression in Klf3(+/+) and Klf3(-/-) tissues. We found that mRNA expression of Fam132a, which encodes a newly identified insulin-sensitizing adipokine, adipolin, is significantly upregulated in the absence of KLF3. We confirmed that KLF3 binds the Fam132a promoter in vitro and in vivo and that this leads to repression of promoter activity. Further, plasma adipolin levels were significantly increased in Klf3(-/-) mice compared to wild-type littermates. Boosting levels of adipolin via targeting of KLF3 offers a novel potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of insulin resistance.
2083404	CHEMICALNOTIN pre-treatment attenuates intensity of bronchial and nasal symptoms precipitated by CHEMICALNOTIN in CHEMICALNOTIN-intolerant patients. CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN) and other non-CHEMICALNOTIN anti-inflammatory drugs, which are GENEIN (GENEIN) inhibitors, precipitate asthmatic attacks in CHEMICALNOTIN-intolerant patients, while CHEMICALIN, hardly active on GENEIN by itself, is well tolerated by these patients. However, CHEMICALIN moiety appears to interfere with CHEMICALIN inhibitory action on platelets and vascular GENEIN. Such interaction, if present at the level of respiratory tract, may be of interest to pathogenesis of CHEMICALNOTIN-induced asthma. We performed a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over study on the effect of CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN, CHEMICALNOTIN) pre-treatment on CHEMICALNOTIN-induced adverse reactions in nine patients. Pulmonary function tests, nasal symptoms score, PNIF and serum CHEMICALNOTIN levels were monitored following challenges with threshold doses of CHEMICALNOTIN. CHEMICALNOTIN administered at a dose of 3000 mg daily for 3 days, offered a moderate protection against CHEMICALNOTIN-induced symptoms; it diminished the severity and/or delayed the appearance of FEV1 fall. Maximal decreases in FEV1 as well as reaction intensity indexes were significantly lower (P less than 0.02 and P less than 0.002, respectively) after CHEMICALNOTIN pre-treatment as compared to placebo. CHEMICALNOTIN also attenuated nasal symptoms in three out of five patients. Although the precise mechanism of the protective action of CHEMICALNOTIN is unknown, our data support the possibility of interaction between CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN on GENEIN locus in the respiratory tract in CHEMICALNOTIN-intolerant patients.
11986668	CHEMICALIN inhibits GENEIN release and delays progression of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in mice. CHEMICALNOTIN mediates neuroprotection in experimental models of neurodegeneration. It inhibits the activity of GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) and GENENOTIN GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN). Although CHEMICALNOTIN does not directly inhibit these enzymes, the effects may result from interference with upstream mechanisms resulting in their secondary activation. Because the above-mentioned factors are important in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we tested CHEMICALNOTIN in mice with ALS. Here we report that CHEMICALNOTIN delays disease onset and extends survival in ALS mice. Given the broad efficacy of CHEMICALNOTIN, understanding its mechanisms of action is of great importance. We find that CHEMICALIN inhibits mitochondrial permeability-transition-mediated GENEIN release. CHEMICALIN-mediated inhibition of GENEIN release is demonstrated in vivo, in cells, and in isolated mitochondria. Understanding the mechanism of action of CHEMICALNOTIN will assist in the development and testing of more powerful and effective analogues. Because of the safety record of CHEMICALNOTIN, and its ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier, this drug may be a novel therapy for ALS.
23380082	Use of the Combination Index to determine interactions between plant-derived phenolic acids on hepatotoxicity endpoints in human and rat hepatoma cells. The beneficial or adverse effects of isolated phytochemicals are not always concordant with effects of the botanical dietary supplements from which they were derived. This disparity could be due to interactions between the various phytochemicals present in the whole plant. The phenolic acids, rosmarinic acid (RA), caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) are widely present in foods and dietary supplements, and they are assumed to exert various beneficial biological effects. However, there is little data on the potential biological interactions of these three phenolic acids which commonly occur together and are linked metabolically. In the present study, liver toxicity of the three phenolic acids was assessed on the three compounds singly and in various binary and one ternary combinations. A series of in vitro endpoints relevant to liver toxicity were evaluated in both a human (HepG2/C3A) and rat (MH1C1) hepatocyte cell line. The Combination Index (CI) was calculated for each endpoint from both the concentration responses of the single compounds and the responses of the various binary and ternary mixtures. Both synergistic and antagonistic interactions were observed for some endpoints and some combinations of test agents. Interactions were most prevalent in measures of oxidative stress and cytochrome P450 activities in both cell types. There was only a 53% concordance between the rat and human cells which may be suggestive of species differences. The data suggest an approach for better characterizing the beneficial or adverse effects of complex botanical products through evaluation of interactions between individual phytochemical components.
7974294	Heterogeneous expression and polymorphic genotype of glutathione S-transferases in human lung. BACKGROUND: Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of xenobiotics by conjugation with glutathione. One of the mu class genes of this superfamily of enzymes, GSTM1, is polymorphic because of a partial gene deletion. This results in a failure to express GSTM1 in approximately 50% of individuals. Several studies have linked GSTM1 null status to an increased risk of lung carcinoma. This study investigated the expression and distribution of GST isoenzymes in human lung, and developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay which would allow genotyping of archival, paraffin embedded lung tissue. METHODS: Distribution was examined using a panel of polyclonal anti-GST antibodies for immunohistochemistry in normal tissue of 21 tumour-bearing lungs. DNA for PCR was extracted from paraffin blocks and a control group of 350 blood lysates. As a positive control each assay amplified part of GSTM4, a mu class gene which is not polymorphic but which shows strong sequence homology to GSTM1. The presence of GST in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was sought by Western analysis. RESULTS: Proximal airways contained pi class GST, alpha class GST, and mu class GST with expression concentrated in the brush border. In distal airspaces no alpha GST was expressed but pi GST and mu GST were present in alveolar cells and also alveolar macrophages. Pi class GST was present in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. The PCR assay enabled genotypic determination using DNA extracted from archival material. Of the control group 56% were null at the GSTM1 locus. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution of GST isoenzymes in the lung is heterogeneous with an apparent decrease in GST in distal lung. Since GSTM1 status has already been associated with susceptibility to disease, the PCR assay developed will allow further studies of the relation between genotype and structural disorders in the lung using archival pathological material.
23578952	GENENOTIN inhibition-induced changes in plasma CHEMICALNOTIN levels, anxiety and locomotor activity in male CD1 mice. The hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal-axis is strongly controlled by the endocannabinoid system. The specific impact of enhanced CHEMICALNOTIN signaling on CHEMICALNOTIN plasma levels, however, was not investigated so far. Here we studied the effects of the recently developed GENEIN inhibitor CHEMICALIN on basal and stress-induced CHEMICALNOTIN levels in male CD1 mice, and found that this compound dramatically increased basal levels without affecting stress responses. Since acute changes in CHEMICALNOTIN levels can affect behavior, CHEMICALNOTIN was administered concurrently with the CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis inhibitor CHEMICALNOTIN, to investigate whether the previously shown behavioral effects of CHEMICALNOTIN are dependent on CHEMICALNOTIN. We found that in the elevated plus-maze, the effects of CHEMICALNOTIN on "classical" anxiety-related measures were abolished by CHEMICALNOTIN synthesis blockade. By contrast, effects on the "ethological" measures of anxiety (i.e. risk assessment) were not affected by CHEMICALNOTIN. In the open-field, the locomotion-enhancing effects of the compound were not changed either. These findings show that GENENOTIN inhibition dramatically increases basal levels of CHEMICALNOTIN. This endocrine effect partly affects the anxiolytic, but not the locomotion-enhancing effects of GENENOTIN blockade.
23643933	Induction of the liver cancer-down-regulated long noncoding RNA GENENOTIN mediates CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis of liver cancer cells. Differential expression of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) plays critical roles in hepatocarcinogenesis. Considerable attention has focused on the antitumor effect of GENEIN inhibitor (CHEMICALIN, CHEMICALIN) as well as the coding gene expression-induced apoptosis of cancer cells. However, it is not known whether lncRNA has a role in CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. The global expression of lncRNAs and coding genes was analyzed with the Human LncRNA Array V2.0 after 24h treatment. Expression was verified in cell lines and tissues by quantitative real-time PCR. The data showed that 4.8% (959) of lncRNA and 6.1% (1849) of protein coding gene were significantly differentially expressed. The differential expressions of lncRNA and protein coding genes had distinguishable hierarchical clustering expression profiling pattern. Among these differentially expressed lncRNAs, the greatest change was noted for GENEIN, which had more than 300 folds induction upon CHEMICALIN treatment. CHEMICALIN selectively induced GENEIN in four studied HCC cell lines. Compared with normal human hepatocytes and adjacent noncancerous tissues, GENENOTIN expression level was significantly lower in the HCC cell lines and liver cancer tissues. The CHEMICALIN-induced GENEIN expression was positively correlated with the apoptotic effect of CHEMICALNOTIN in HCC cells. In addition, knockdown the expression of GENENOTIN significantly reduced CHEMICALNOTIN-induced apoptosis of Huh7cells. Therefore, CHEMICALIN-induced apoptosis of HCC cells is GENEIN dependent and reduced expression of GENENOTIN may be associated with liver carcinogenesis.
23347038	The CHEMICALIN-binding sites of CHEMICALNOTIN/GENEIN determine its capacity to suppress matrix invasion by squamous cell carcinoma cells. The CHEMICALIN (CHEMICALIN)/GENEIN (GENEIN) interacts with a variety of factors that impinge on tumour invasion and metastasis. It has been shown that expression of wild-type CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN reduces the tumorigenic and invasive properties of receptor-deficient SCC-VII squamous cell carcinoma cells. We have now used mutant forms of CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN to assess the relevance of the different ligand-binding sites of the receptor for its biological activities in this cellular system. The results of the present study demonstrate that CHEMICALNOTIN/GENENOTIN does not require a functional binding site for GENENOTIN for inhibition of anchorage-independent growth and matrix invasion by SCC-VII cells. In contrast, the simultaneous mutation of both CHEMICALNOTIN-binding sites is sufficient to impair all cellular functions of the receptor tested. These findings highlight that the interaction between CHEMICALNOTIN/GENEIN and CHEMICALIN-modified ligands is not only important for intracellular accumulation of lysosomal enzymes and formation of dense lysosomes, but is also crucial for the ability of the receptor to suppress SCC-VII growth and invasion. The present study also shows that some of the biological activities of CHEMICALNOTIN/GENEIN in SCC-VII cells strongly depend on a functional CHEMICALIN-binding site within domain 3, thus providing further evidence for the non-redundant cellular functions of the individual CHEMICALNOTIN-binding domains of the receptor.
10730683	CHEMICALIN, a new GENEIN inhibitor for the management of obesity. CHEMICALNOTIN, a weight-loss agent with a novel mechanism of action, recently was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of obesity. It inhibits GENENOTIN in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract to decrease systemic absorption of dietary fat. In several trials lasting up to 2 years, CHEMICALNOTIN was more effective than diet alone for weight reduction and maintenance of lost weight. CHEMICALIN treatment also results in modest improvements in total CHEMICALNOTIN, GENEIN, blood pressure, and fasting CHEMICALNOTIN and GENEIN concentrations. The major adverse effects are gastrointestinal, usually occur early in therapy, and tend to decrease with continued treatment. Because CHEMICALNOTIN may decrease the absorption of fat-soluble CHEMICALNOTIN, a standard multiple-CHEMICALNOTIN supplement is recommended daily during therapy to prevent abnormalities in CHEMICALNOTIN serum concentrations. The potential for severe gastrointestinal discomfort and the modest degree of weight loss may limit the agent's clinical utility. Its long-term safety and effectiveness for weight maintenance, cost-effectiveness of treatment, and overall reduction in obesity-related morbidity and mortality remain to be determined.
23637347	The Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Genetic Variant Rs5068 Is Associated With a Favorable Cardiometabolic Phenotype in a Mediterranean Population. OBJECTIVEWe hypothesized that the minor allele of the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) genetic variant rs5068 is associated with a favorable cardiometabolic phenotype in a general Mediterranean population.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSWe genotyped a random sample of the residents of Ventimiglia di Sicilia, Sicily, for rs5068.RESULTSGenotype frequencies of rs5068 are AA, 93.5%; AG, 6.4%; and GG, 0.1%. All subsequent analyses are AA versus AG+GG. After adjusting for age and sex, the minor G allele is associated with lower BMI (estimate [SE]: -1.7 kg/m(2) [0.8], P = 0.04). In the AG+GG group, males with HDL cholesterol levels <40 mg/dL are less frequent (P = 0.05) and obesity tends to be less prevalent (P = 0.07). Importantly, the G allele is associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome (P = 0.02). After adjusting for BMI, the above associations were attenuated. Independently of age, sex, and BMI, the minor allele is also associated with lower systolic blood pressure (-6.0 mmHg [2.5], P = 0.02) and lower prevalence of hypertension (odds ratio 0.41 [95% CI 0.20-0.83], P = 0.01).CONCLUSIONSThe association between the minor allele of rs5068 and a favorable cardiometabolic phenotype that we previously reported in a U.S. population is now replicated in a Mediterranean population in which the G allele of rs5068 is associated with lower blood pressure, BMI, and prevalence of hypertension and metabolic syndrome. These findings may lead to a diagnostic strategy to assess cardiometabolic risk and lay the foundation for the future development of an ANP or ANP-like therapy for metabolic syndrome.
1663395	The GENENOTIN: modulation of its expression in thyroid cells. Evidence has accumulated in the last few years that the expression of the GENEIN (GENEIN) in thyroid cells is induced by GENENOTIN, through pathways which involve intracellular CHEMICALIN accumulation and protein synthesis. These data have been found true in any thyroid system studied so far, both in terms of immunologic and enzymatic activity of GENENOTIN. GENENOTIN and CHEMICALIN also increase the levels of the specific mRNA for GENEIN in thyroid cells from different species. Whether this phenomenon is due to a direct transcriptional regulation of the GENENOTIN gene, as shown in dog thyroid cells, or to posttranscriptional effects, as it would appear in FRTL-5 cells, remains to be clarified by future experiments. GENENOTIN (GENENOTIN) of Graves' disease also stimulates the expression of GENENOTIN. This finding gives further support to the relevance of GENENOTIN in the pathogenesis of hyperthyroidism and explains the well known observation that the "microsomal" antigen is particularly abundant in glands of Graves' patients. The modulation of GENENOTIN surface expression by GENENOTIN can explain the decrease of circulating anti-MAb observed during CHEMICALNOTIN therapy in hypothyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Other agents, such as CHEMICALIN and CHEMICALIN, which influence thyroid cell function, do not directly interfere with the expression of GENEIN. GENENOTIN, such as GENENOTIN, GENENOTIN, and GENENOTIN have been shown to inhibit the GENENOTIN-induced increase of GENENOTIN mRNA, but further investigations are required to elucidate the exact role of GENENOTIN in the regulation of GENENOTIN expression.
23569204	Structural and functional characterization of a GENENOTIN within yeast general transcription factor GENENOTIN. GENEIN, a subunit of the GENENOTIN-specific general transcription factor GENENOTIN, comprises an CHEMICALIN-terminal CHEMICALIN phosphatase domain (GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN) whose catalytic activity and cellular function is poorly understood. We solved the crystal structures of GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN and its closely related paralogue GENENOTIN and used in silico docking methods to identify CHEMICALNOTIN and CHEMICALNOTIN containing peptides as possible substrates that were subsequently validated using in vitro GENENOTIN assays. A comparative CHEMICALNOTIN-proteomic study identified additional phosphopeptides as possible targets, which show the involvement of these two GENENOTIN in the regulation of a variety of cellular functions. Our results identify GENENOTIN-GENENOTIN and Huf as bona fide GENENOTIN, characterize their substrate specificities and provide a small set of regulated phosphosite targets in vivo.
23506741	A novel CHEMICALIN derivate prevents the development of dextran sulfate CHEMICALNOTIN-induced murine experimental colitis via inhibition of GENEIN inflammasome. GENENOTIN inflammasome has been reported to be associated with various kinds of immunological diseases including colitis. However, there are few drug candidates targeting inflammasomes for the treatment of colitis. In the present study, we aimed at examining the effect of CHEMICALIN, a synthetic small molecular compound also named CHEMICALIN, for the treatment of dextran CHEMICALNOTIN CHEMICALNOTIN (DSS)-induced experimental colitis in mice via targeting GENEIN inflammasome. Treatment with Fc11a-2 dose-dependently attenuated the loss of body weight and shortening of colon length induced by DSS. In addition, the disease activity index, histopathologic scores and GENEIN activity were also significantly reduced by CHEMICALIN treatment. Moreover, protein and mRNA levels of DSS-induced proinflammatory GENEIN in colon, including GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN, were markedly suppressed by CHEMICALIN. Furthermore, a decreased CD11c(+) macrophage infiltration in colons and inactivation of GENEIN in peritoneal macrophages were detected in CHEMICALIN-2-treated mice. The mechanism of action of CHEMICALIN was related to the inhibition of the cleavage of GENEIN, GENEIN and GENEIN which in turn suppressed the activation of GENEIN inflammasome. Taken together, our results demonstrate the ability of CHEMICALIN to inhibit GENEIN inflammasome activation and its potential use in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases.
17611273	CHEMICALNOTIN administration to juvenile rats alters brain areas involved in cognition, motivated behaviors, appetite, and stress. Thousands of children receive CHEMICALNOTIN (CHEMICALNOTIN; CHEMICALNOTIN) for attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), yet the long-term neurochemical consequences of CHEMICALNOTIN treatment are unknown. To mimic clinical CHEMICALNOTIN treatment in children, male rats were injected with CHEMICALNOTIN (5 mg/kg) or vehicle twice daily from postnatal day 7 (PND7)-PND35. At the end of administration (PND35) or in adulthood (PND135), brain sections from littermate pairs were immunocytochemically labeled for neurotransmitters and cytological markers in 16 regions implicated in CHEMICALNOTIN effects and/or ADHD etiology. At PND35, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of rats given CHEMICALIN showed 55% greater immunoreactivity (-ir) for the CHEMICALNOTIN marker GENEIN (GENEIN), 60% more Nissl-stained cells, and 40% less GENEIN (GENEIN)-ir density. In hippocampal dentate gyrus, CHEMICALIN-receiving rats showed a 51% decrease in GENEIN-ir density and a 61% expanded distribution of the new-cell marker PSA-GENEIN (polysialylated form of GENEIN). In medial striatum, GENEIN-ir decreased by 21%, and in hypothalamus GENEIN-ir increased by 10% in CHEMICALIN-exposed rats. At PND135, MPH-exposed rats exhibited decreased anxiety in the elevated plus-maze and a trend for decreased GENENOTIN-ir in the mPFC. Neither PND35 nor PND135 rats showed major structural differences with CHEMICALNOTIN exposure. These findings suggest that developmental exposure to high therapeutic doses of CHEMICALNOTIN has short-term effects on select neurotransmitters in brain regions involved in motivated behaviors, cognition, appetite, and stress. Although the observed neuroanatomical changes largely resolve with time, chronic modulation of young brains with CHEMICALNOTIN may exert effects on brain neurochemistry that modify some behaviors even in adulthood.
