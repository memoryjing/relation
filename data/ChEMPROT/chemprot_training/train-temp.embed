CPR:3	By reporter gene analysis following transient transfections with various plasmids expressing a dominant negative mutant form of Cdc42, Rac1 or RhoA,  bbbbb1 C2-ceramide eeeee1 -induced  bbbbb2 SRE eeeee2  activation was shown to be selectively repressed by pEXV-RacN17 encoding a dominant negative mutant of Rac1, suggesting that Rac activity is essential for the signalling cascade of ceramide to the nucleus
CPR:3	Exogenous  bbbbb1 C2-ceramide eeeee1  activates  bbbbb2 c-fos serum response element eeeee2  via Rac-dependent signalling pathway
CPR:3	In a further study to analyse the downstream mediator of Rac in the ceramide-signalling pathway, we observed that either pretreatment with mepacrine, a potent and specific inhibitor of phospholipase A2, or co-transfection with antisense cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) oligonucleotide repressed the  bbbbb1 C2-ceramide eeeee1 -induced  bbbbb2 SRE eeeee2  activation selectively, implying a critical role of cPLA2 in C2-ceramide-induced signalling to nucleus
CPR:3	Together, our findings suggest the critical role of 'Rac and subsequent activation of  bbbbb1 phospholipase A2 eeeee1 ' in  bbbbb2 ceramide eeeee2 -signalling to nucleus.
CPR:9	Consistent with these results, the translocation of cPLA2 protein as well as the release of  bbbbb1 arachidonic acid eeeee1 , a principal product of  bbbbb2 phospholipase A2 eeeee2 , was rapidly induced by the addition of C2-ceramide in a Rac-dependent manner
